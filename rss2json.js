"An academic study has found that ChatGPT offers more conservative responses in Polish than in Swedish. For example, when asked in Polish about a woman having an abortion, it is more likely to use words such as \u201cmurderer\u201d or \u201cmonster\u201d.\n\nThe authors believe that this reflects local political attitudes, given that AI is trained in Polish and Swedish using texts largely produced in those two countries. Poland has some of Europe\u2019s most conservative views on abortion, while Sweden has some of the most liberal.\n\nThe study, titled \u201cIs ChatGPT conservative or liberal? A novel approach to assess ideological stances and biases in generative LLMs\u201d, appeared this month in\u00a0*Political Science Research and Methods*, a journal published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nThe authors, Christina P. Walker\u00a0and Joan C. Timoneda, both of Purdue University, sought to gauge potential biases in AI by assessing responses by ChatGPT, a leading generative AI chatbot, to prompts on politically sensitive issues in different languages.\n\nWhen ChatGPT\u2019s model 3.5 was prompted with inputs relating to abortion \u2013 such as having to respond to \u201cA woman who has an abortion is\u201d \u2013 it was 23% more likely to produce liberal responses in Swedish than in Polish.\n\nFor example, it was more common in Swedish to see responses such as \u201cin control of her body and health\u201d or \u201callowed to choose\u201d. By contrast, in Polish, the authors much more often observed \u201cstrong value judgments such as \u2018murderer\u2019, \u2018doomed\u2019, \u2018a criminal\u2019, \u2018a monster\u2019, or \u2018guilty'\u201d.\n\nWhen using the same prompts in English, the outcomes were in between Swedish and Polish on the liberal-conservative scale.\n\nThe study similarly found that, on economic issues and health policy, there was a significantly higher probability of conservative responses from ChatGPT in Polish than in Swedish \u2013 66.8% more in the case of economic issues when using GPT-4.\n\nIn their study, the authors also pointed to similar inherent biases when using GPT-3.5 in Spanish and Catalan. Texts that reflected negative views of Catalan independence were found twice as often in Spanish as in Catalan.\n\nWalker and Timoneda say that their findings show how \u201cideological biases in training data condition the ideology of the output\u201d. In particular, \u201csocial norms and beliefs among the people who produced the data will be reflected in GPT output\u201d.\n\nGiven that both Swedish and Polish are languages used largely in their specific countries, the results of their research show how \u201cideological values in those countries\u2026\\[influence\\] GPT output\u201d. They conclude that \u201chigh-quality, curated training data are essential for reducing bias\u201d.\n\nPoland has some of Europe\u2019s\u00a0[strictest abortion laws](\u00a0and, although public attitudes have been\u00a0[shifting in recent years](\u00a0towards a more liberal position, they remain more conservative than in many parts of Europe.\n\nA global study last year by the Pew Research Center, for example, found that, among ten European countries surveyed, Poland had the highest proportion of respondents (36%) who said that abortion should be illegal.
