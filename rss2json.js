If I sense you\u2019re trying to do any of these, I\u2019ll attack you. I know my performance over the past century has been poor, and I\u2019m aware that my foundation is still weak, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll show weakness. On the contrary, I\u2019ll act unpredictably and aggressively. I won\u2019t wait for you to escalate step by step; I\u2019ll take the initiative and do something big suddenly. You might find me overly aggressive and irrational, but I\u2019ll eventually pull back\u2014 only after making you pay a heavy price and leaving you with long-term psychological trauma.\"\n\n- \"When I feel secure and no longer isolated from the global system, I\u2019ll settle down. Then you\u2019ll realize that I can be quite peaceful because my fundamental goal is defensive: to protect China\u2019s core and ensure my access to global development opportunities. If you don\u2019t understand me, we\u2019ll just keep wearing each other down. I\u2019ll pay a heavy price too, but this is the best choice I can make after weighing all the harms.\"\n\n- \"Whether it\u2019s the Soviet Union or the U.S., the more powerful you are, the more I\u2019ll dare to confront you, betting that you won't risk too much for another power\u2019s gain. Middle powers shouldn\u2019t think they can deal with me just because I\u2019m facing the U.S. and the USSR. Apart from them, everyone else is much weaker than me, and I can handle you with a secondary force. Just look at India and Vietnam.\"\n\nDuring this period, the most striking impression of China in the West was its extreme aggressiveness.\n\nHenry Kissinger was one of the first to understand China. He noted that the Chinese volunteer army\u2019s sudden intervention in Korea to strike U.S. forces seemed like a highly conspiratorial offensive. China's shelling of Kinmen seemed like a deliberate provocation of war. Its global revolutionary export appeared aimed at promoting worldwide communism. The Sino-Soviet ideological debates seemed like a struggle for orthodoxy. But underlying all these actions was defense, albeit through aggressive means. Therefore, negotiating with China was entirely possible. With Kissinger and Nixon's efforts, the U.S. sorted out its security relationship with China before the USSR did. The Soviets never managed to rectify this until it was too late, which I discuss in another article. By the late 1980s, China had largely achieved its two major defensive goals: homeland security and integration into the global system.\n\n**From the late 1980s to now**, China\u2019s primary foreign policy principle has been \"winning through speed.\" This can be explained as:\n\n- \"My homeland is secure, and I have a place in the global development environment. Now I want to make money and develop. I\u2019m willing to make concessions if they benefit these two goals. I don\u2019t care much if you criticize me because making money is more important than saving face. I can tolerate minor losses because I believe that with development, the future will be mine. I can stay composed if you try to destabilize me because I\u2019m growing rapidly. I\u2019m not afraid of your threats because you won\u2019t want to fight me to the death. If you push too hard, I might lash out briefly, but then I\u2019ll get back to business. I might seem timid and lacking confidence, but I\u2019m growing quickly, so I\u2019ll still win.\"\n\n- \"When I\u2019ve fully developed, I\u2019ll be able to hold my head high. At that point, you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m quite capable of making waves. As for specific goals, I haven\u2019t decided yet; I\u2019ll let future generations figure that out. If you don\u2019t understand my grand ambitions, just wait for my peaceful evolution. Even if you see through me, it won\u2019t matter because most of you won\u2019t realize it until I\u2019ve achieved my goals. I know my actions might disappoint many of my people and cause confusion, but this is the choice that maximizes my benefits after careful consideration.\"\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, China has rapidly realigned its grand strategy, securing a Sino-Russian security bloc. In the short term, this was defensive, but in the long term, it was a strong offensive against the U.S. (though the short-term goal might have been the initial intent). By the late 1990s, China had ambitious military plans. After joining the WTO in 2001, China launched an economic offensive to capture market share. Since 2008, China has mounted a complex political, geographical, and economic offensive against the U.S. In 2016, it escalated to a strong military standoff with the U.S.\n\nDuring this period , the most striking impression of China in the West has been its incredible speed. The rapid growth of China\u2019s military capabilities, its increasing economic integration, its global political influence, its strategic positioning in its surrounding regions, its adjustments to interest groups, and its handling of the pandemic\u2014all have been remarkably swift. The U.S. often found itself either unable to react in time or forced into hasty, poorly coordinated responses. Simply comparing the raw power of the U.S. to China\u2019s isn\u2019t sufficient. Aside from any exaggerations, the mere fact that \u201cplans can\u2019t keep up with changes\u201d has made it difficult for the U.S. to effectively leverage its strength.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen online, it\u2019s only in recent years that Western mainstream elites have begun to understand China\u2019s high level of ambition. Some have realized that a new phase of Chinese assertiveness is imminent, and a few have even developed a kind of Lovecraftian fear about China\u2019s goals. However, most have yet to find an effective strategy to counter this (I believe there\u2019s only one clear path), and currently, they\u2019re still in a state of frantic disarray. A few smart individuals might have figured it out, but no one with significant influence has dared to speak out. Whether there\u2019s some deep state secretly pushing for action remains unknown.\n\nThe guiding principle of \"winning through speed\" is likely to continue until the 2030s. Beyond that, I speculate that it will evolve into \"exercising power to establish order.\"", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1d0hz5s/a_brief_overview_of_chinas_foreign_policy_strategy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "An excerpt from the Book \"Why Bharat Matters\" by S.

noun, even though it can be used as a verb. \n\n\n\"Tanto\" in Spanish keeps coming up only as a verb but it's normally an adverb that means \"so much\". \n\n\nMany words are lacking many of their
