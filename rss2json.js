An interesting yet overlooked front however was the response of the international community. Many countries around the world saw the clashes with curiosity and concern, with some countries backing either Pakistan or India, while others called for a de-escalation. To that end I am interested to know, will there be any changes in Indian foreign policy following this debacle? By that I mean will India shift closer towards certain countries while pulling away from others? Will this latest escalation see a recalibration in Indian foreign policy? Or will Indian foreign policy continue on the same path as it did pre Pahalgam?
