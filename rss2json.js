Our experiments on MTEB datasets show that the combination of keyword search, vector search and a re-ranker via an xgboost model (denoted as ES+VS+RR\\_n) can significantly improve the vector search (VS) baseline.\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\nThe initial release of Denser Retriever provides the following features.\n\n* Supporting heterogeneous retrievers such as keyword search, vector search, and ML model reranking\n* Leveraging xgboost ML technique to effectively combine heterogeneous retrievers\n* State-of-the-art accuracy on [MTEB]( Retrieval benchmarking\n* Demonstrating how to use Denser retriever to power an end-to-end applications such as chatbot and semantic search\n\nHappy Retrieving!
