I understand it will take a lot of time to get there but the whole idea of AI and LLMs really excite me and love the idea of eventually working in the field. From what I've seen, most people say you need to fully understand programs like python and other coding programs in order to break into the field but between prompting LLMs and watching YouTube videos along with a few articles here and there, I feel I've learned a tremendous amount. Im not 100% sure of what a prompt engineer really does so I was really wondering if I could reach that level of competence through using LLMs to write code, produce answers I want, and create programs exactly how I imagined. My question is, do I have to take structured classes or programs in order to break into the this field or is it possible to learn by trial and error using LLMs and AI? Id love any feed back in ways to learn... I feel its much easier to learn through LLMs and using different AI programs to learn compared to books/ classes but I'm more than happy to approach this learning experience in a more effective way, thank you!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jnleq5/using_llms_to_teach_me_how_to_become_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indian Consulate General in Jaffna launches Hindi course amid growing interest in learning", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-consulate-general-in-jaffna-launches-hindi-course-amid-growing-interest-in-learning/articleshow/119750591.cms", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
