Trento, on the other hand, is more research-oriented but includes an almost year-long mandatory internship, unlike the other universities. Additionally, the Trento program only accepts 80 students per year, making it seem much more \"exclusive.\" After completing this program, one is practically already on the path to a PhD in Computational Linguistics or Artificial Intelligence.
