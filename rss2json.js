For the most part I am a psychology researcher and have just started exploring NLP. I have extracted a relevant sample that I am then doing classifications (with setfit, or possibly fastfit which is new and seems cool) for relevance, then sentiment.\n\nI am then hoping to do topic modeling - I was planning on using BERTopic to do topic modeling within each sentiment category. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been having the thought that it would be cool to try and visualize the relationships between topics based on patterns for presence within each post. I was thinking of trying to create a network diagram where nodes are topics, and edges represent relationships based on frequency of co-occurrence within posts.\n\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for how I might go about doing this? The Reddit posts I am using are long - I was originally planning on splitting posts into individual sentences (because most posts will contain multiple topics). But then I was looking at topic distributions for each post which seemed quite useful.\n\n Could I then visualize topic networks based on topic distributions for each post? Most of the NLP clustering I've seen is more semantic clustering. I care about that for refining topics, but then what I'm really curious about is patterns with how these topics appear together within posts. \n\nOf note the dataset is quite large (after classifying for relevance, about 170k individual posts), but I don\u2019t mind renting cloud GPUs if need be.\n\nI will also look at topic relationships with an adjacency matrix, but visualizing networks could be useful for exploring topic clustering.\n\nAny recommendations would be deeply appreciated!! Either for achieving what I\u2019m trying to do, or other visualizations or analyses that would be useful. I\u2019m a bit of a novice when it comes to NLP.
