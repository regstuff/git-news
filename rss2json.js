Drawing on an abstract modeling of the deep regularities underlying power projection dynamics, it identifies priority action sequences in the economic, technological, military, diplomatic, and cultural domains. The central objective is to acquire a lasting structural centrality within the international system by locking in decisive comparative advantages, positioning oneself as an obligatory passage point for strategic flows, and proactively shaping the global environment. The keystone of this strategy lies in optimal mobilization and selective allocation of all national resources, articulated with great adaptability to context changes enabled by a continuous Bayesian learning process. Ultimately, the goal is to reconfigure the deep structure of the international system to establish a hegemonic order locked to its advantage.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe quest for hegemony constitutes a constant in international life, as evidenced by the seminal works of Thucydides on the confrontation between Sparta and Athens (Lebow, 2003), Gibbon on the rise and fall of the Roman Empire (Gibbon, 1776), Kennedy on the rise and fall of great powers (Kennedy, 1987), or Mearsheimer on the tragedy of great power politics (Mearsheimer, 2001). This recurrence of attempts at global domination through the ages raises two enigmas: how to explain that international actors nurture hegemonic ambitions despite historical precedents attesting to the precariousness of such enterprises? And why do some imperial trajectories manage to establish a relatively stable hegemonic order where others fail?\n\nThe thesis defended here is that, beyond the singularity of spatio-temporal configurations, it is possible to identify deep regularities and generic principles of hegemonic strategy, the mastery of which conditions success. To shed light on these invariants, this plan proposes a stylized modeling of the springs of power, which takes the form of an ideal type in the Weberian sense (Weber, 1922), that is, a conceptual construction obtained by deliberate accentuation of certain features of reality. The challenge is to uncover a universal grammar of international domination, whose operating rules transcend historical and cultural contingencies.\n\nTo do this, the reasoning will proceed in three stages. First, it will seek to explicate the fundamental postulates of a general theory of hegemony, identifying the deep forces that drive actors to seek international primacy and the generative mechanisms that shape the structure of systems of domination. Secondly, it will decompose the trajectory of hegemonic ascension into an ordered sequence of strategic priorities, specifying for each stage the objectives to be achieved, the resources to be mobilized, and the levers of action to be activated. Finally, in a third stage, it will examine the conditions of possibility for a sustainable hegemony, analyzing the resilience factors of a locked international order and the adaptation strategies to deploy in the face of inevitable contestation dynamics.\n\nIn doing so, the ambition is to provide an analytical compass and a universal repertoire of action to any aspiring hegemon, allowing them to structure their strategic thinking and optimize the allocation of their resources with a view to conquering and then preserving a position of global preeminence.\n\n**I - The fundamental postulates of a general theory of hegemony**\n\n*1.1 The postulate of the will to power*\n\nAt the foundation of this reasoning lies a cardinal anthropological postulate: every political entity fundamentally aspires to maximize its power, understood as its capacity to impose its will on other actors (Morgenthau, 1948). This appetite for power constitutes the primary driver of international relations, the conatus of states to borrow the Spinozist concept (Matheron, 1988). Machiavelli already theorized this irrepressible impulse: \"Ambition is so powerful in the heart of man that, no matter how high a rank he may be, it never abandons him\" (Machiavelli, 1532).\n\nThe classical works of Hobbes (1651), Clausewitz (1832), or Nietzsche (1886) have confirmed this psychological invariant, as have contemporary research in political psychology (Winter, 2003; Byman &amp; Pollack, 2001). This will to power finds its origin in human nature itself and is further exacerbated at the scale of nations by the anarchy of the international system (Waltz, 1979). As Mearsheimer (2001, p. 2) summarizes: \"Survival is the principal goal of every state in the international system, and states always fear that other states have the intention to harm them. Consequently, states quickly recognize that it is imperative to be powerful to protect themselves\".\n\nIt is this observation that grounds the hegemonic quest: the aspiration for domination appears as the natural extension, at the scale of nations, of this power drive anchored in the depths of the human psyche (Muravchik, 1991). The aspiration to the monopoly of power thus presents itself as the logical extension of this inherent impulse for domination in politics (Gilpin, 1981), regardless of cultural or ideological specificities.\n\n*1.2 The iron law of oligopoly and the principle of hierarchical differentiation*\n\nFrom the states' will to power stems a heavy historical tendency towards the concentration of international power among a restricted number of dominant actors (Gilpin, 1981; Levy, 1983). This \"iron law of oligopoly\" mechanically results from the interstate competition induced by the anarchy of the international system (Waltz, 1979) and the unequal endowment of resources among the entities present (Wallerstein, 2004). In the absence of a supranational authority, each state is indeed incentivized to maximize its relative power to guarantee its security and promote its interests (Mearsheimer, 1994).\n\nThis results in an inevitable dynamic of hierarchical differentiation between center and periphery (Braudel, 1985; Galtung, 1971), a \"deep structure\" of international relations that transcends the specificities of competing units (Wallerstein, 2004; Chase-Dunn &amp; Grimes, 1995). Over the long historical duration, the system thus tends to organize around a reduced number of \"great powers\" that polarize the bulk of material capacities and political influence. As Wight (1946, p. 50) points out: \"A striking feature of the international system throughout history has been the recurrence of a pattern of balance of power, or more precisely of a small group of great powers\".\n\nThis process, analogous to the formation of restricted elites monopolizing a disproportionate share of wealth and power within societies (Pareto, 1917), induces a structural asymmetry of power relations on an international scale. Therefore, the challenge for any aspiring hegemon is to impose and lock in the mechanisms of reproduction of its domination at the top of this hierarchy (Arrighi, 1994).\n\n*1.3 The primacy of the power differential*\n\nIn this competition for systemic leadership, an actor's relative position depends less on its absolute power attributes than on its gap with its main competitors (Organski &amp; Kugler, 1980). It is the power differential that is decisive, as it determines the ability to unilaterally modify the balance of power and to weigh on the representations and anticipations of other actors (Blainey, 1973). To establish its domination, the hegemon must ensure a crushing comparative advantage in the strategic domains (economic, technological, military, ideological) that shape the balance of power in the long term (Strange, 1988).\n\nAs Dahl (1957) showed in his classic analysis, power must be conceived as an asymmetric relationship of influence, where A obtains from B a behavior that the latter would not have spontaneously adopted. However, this relationship is eminently perceptual and intersubjective: it is B's belief in A's superiority that produces obedience, more than the objective capacity gap (Jervis, 1976). Therefore, the challenge for the aspiring hegemon is to create and maintain, in the minds of other actors, the conviction of a decisive advantage in its favor, even if it rests only on a narrow margin in reality (Wohlforth, 1993).\n\nIt is by widening this gap, both real and perceived, in critical domains that strategic ascendancy is acquired (Schweller, 1998). This implies identifying these decisive variables upstream and investing in them as a priority to create durable and cumulative asymmetries (Nye, 2004). Indeed, the preeminent position does not proceed from a simple quantitative superiority in the gross endowment of power resources, but from the ability to create a decisive qualitative gap in the key success factors (Wohlforth, 1999). The power differential thus modifies the deep structure of opportunities and incentives (Deudney, 2014), allowing the hegemon to exert a determining influence on the international system.\n\n*1.4 The Imperative of Systemic Preeminence*\n\nTrue hegemony is not limited to a quantitative superiority in the raw distribution of power or a sum of sectoral advantages. It involves occupying a central, structurally preeminent position within the international system (Ikenberry &amp; Kupchan, 1990; Ikenberry, 2011). The hegemon is not just the strongest: it is also and above all \"at the center\" of the system, controlling its main parameters and orienting its outputs (Modeski, 1987). It is the \"focal point\" that polarizes the flows of material and symbolic exchanges and defines the \"rules of the game\" governing interactions (Krasner, 1976, 1983).\n\nThis centrality is first manifested by control over the networks of material (trade, finance, technologies) and immaterial (information, culture, norms) exchanges that innervate world politics (Keohane &amp; Nye, 1977). It then translates into the ability to define the rules of the game, to impose the standards and procedures that govern interactions, and to shape the institutions that frame cooperation and crystallize power asymmetries (Ikenberry, 2001). Finally, it is expressed by the ability to project one's preferences, values, and \"soft power\" on a global scale, shaping the representations and expectations of other actors (Nye, 1990).\n\nThis preeminence does not only stem from coercive means (\"hard power\"), but also and especially from cooptative and incentive mechanisms aimed at rallying the consent of the governed (Ikenberry &amp; Kupchan, 1990). The hegemon organizes international cooperation in a way that reflects its interests but provides enough benefits to secondary states to elicit their voluntary adherence (Gilpin, 1981). It structures the configuration of interdependencies asymmetrically, placing itself in the position of a \"structural hole\" (Burt, 1995), that is, an obligatory intermediary in strategic interactions.\n\nThe hegemon strives to lock in this relational architecture through normative and institutional investments aimed at perpetuating its positional advantage (Ikenberry, 2001). Thus, far from accommodating the status quo, it actively shapes its international environment to promote an order favorable to its long-term interests (Layne, 2006). Ultimately, the hegemon is distinguished by its ability to produce international order, to generate alignment dynamics, and to shape the environment to its advantage (Strange, 1987).\n\n*1.5 The Necessity of the \"Decisive\" Comparative Advantage and the Law of Increasing Returns to Power*\n\nTo establish lasting systemic preeminence, the mere possession of raw superiority in power aggregates is not enough. It is necessary to hold a \"decisive\" comparative advantage, a \"master asset\" conferring overwhelming superiority in a key area and producing spillover effects on other domains (Modelski &amp; Thompson, 1996). This advantage can take various forms: exclusive mastery of a breakthrough technology, monopolistic control of a critical resource, undisputed military supremacy, or ideological and cultural hegemony.\n\nThe essential point is that this comparative advantage provides a decisive lever to transcend the logic of the balance of power (Wohlforth, 1999) and generate cumulative dynamics of alignment in favor of the hegemon (Walt, 1987). Indeed, this systemic preeminence is not only an effect of preponderance: it is also its cause, through a mechanism of \"increasing returns\" to hegemonic power (Krasner, 1976).\n\nCentrality confers on the hegemon positive network externalities that continually reinforce its ascendancy: domestic market size effect (Krugman, 1991), ability to attract resource flows (Kindleberger, 1986), economies of scale in the production of international public goods (Olson, 1965), bargaining advantage in defining the rules of the game (Drezner, 2007). These feedback loops structurally multiply the hegemon's power and widen the gap with potential challengers (Arthur, 1994). Hence the crucial challenge of reaching a \"critical mass\" beyond which these cumulative effects become self-sustaining (Krugman, 1991b).\n\n*1.6 The Imperative of Locking in Acquired Advantages*\n\nHowever, this virtuous dynamic is not mechanical: it must be actively cultivated and defended against the rebalancing forces it inevitably generates (Gilpin, 1981). The accumulation of power tends to generate strategies of contestation among other actors aimed at containing the hegemon (Walt, 2005) or challenging the terms of the asymmetric relationship (Organski, 1958). To counter this, the hegemon must strive to institutionally lock in power asymmetries, making them more costly to contest than to accept (Ikenberry, 2001). This involves establishing international regimes that perpetuate favorable rules of the game (Krasner, 1982), entrenching norms that legitimize the existing hierarchy (Finnemore, 1996), and instituting mechanisms of cooptation and selective redistribution of cooperative gains (Kupchan, 1998). The challenge is to structure the configuration of interests in a way that discourages secessionist tendencies and favors alignment behaviors (Ikenberry &amp; Kupchan, 1990).\n\n**II - Strategic Sequencing of the Hegemonic Ascension Trajectory**\n\n*2.1 Optimizing the Resource Base Under Sustainability Constraints*\n\nThe foundation of any hegemonic trajectory lies in the optimization and securing of power resources (Kennedy, 1987). This approach involves maximum and efficient mobilization of production factors - demography, territory, raw materials, and capital - to generate sustained and sustainable growth (Solow, 1956).\n\nTo understand this dynamic, it is useful to conceive of a nation as a complex energy system. In this system, you have inputs, outputs, and an efficiency to optimize to maximize your country's power. And in this grand game of geopolitics, demographics constitute the essential fuel.\n\nOn the demographic front, the challenge is threefold: stimulate quantitative growth through pro-natalist policies (Teitelbaum &amp; Winter, 1985) and selective immigration (Iredale, 2001), develop human capital through massive investments in education, training, and health (Schultz, 1961), and preserve social cohesion (Castles et al., 2002). The objective is to build a large, skilled, and productive population, the foundation of a dynamic and innovative economy. This requires a substantial budgetary effort (5-7% of GDP) to avoid talent shortages and chronic low productivity (Hanushek &amp; Woessmann, 2015).\n\nThe basic assumption is that the decision to have a child responds, at least in part, to a cost-benefit calculation balancing the expected satisfactions and pains of this commitment. Certainly, this calculation is never purely rational or purely economic: it incorporates a large part of affects, impulses, and socially conditioned symbolic representations. But it nonetheless obeys a fundamental logic of trade-off between the desire for children and competing aspirations, a trade-off whose terms are shaped by environmental incentives and constraints.\n\nTherefore, the central challenge for a pro-natalist policy is to configure this incentive environment in such a way that the procreative choice appears more attractive and less costly than the alternatives. This involves activating four complementary levers, in increasing order of importance: reducing the objective cost of children, increasing the material and symbolic rewards associated with parenthood, restricting the attractiveness of competing lifestyles, and shaping subjective preferences to elicit an early and intense desire for children.\n\nThe first lever consists of socializing as much as possible the burden of costs directly induced by children, whether their vital needs (food, clothing, housing, health) or expenses related to their development (education, leisure, transport). The ideal is to tend towards complete free care and education of minors, via a system of in-kind allowances and universal public services financed by taxes. This amounts to operating a massive transfer of resources from households without children to families, so as to cancel out the marginal cost of bringing an additional human being into the world.\n\nThe second lever aims to increase the relative expected benefits of parenthood, through a range of fiscal, social, and status advantages that increase with the number of children. We can imagine a modulation of working time, retirement rights, access to housing and credit, or tax burdens based on family size. It's about creating a privileged status for deserving parents, accompanied by honorary and material rewards, so as to make fertility desirable and profitable. The key is to convey the image of a demographic elite reaping the fruits of its outstanding contribution to the perpetuation of the community.\n\nThe third lever, more subtle but no less crucial, consists of discouraging behaviors and lifestyles alternative to the large family. This involves targeted increases in the cost of activities competing with procreation, whether leisure, travel, status consumption goods, or sexual freedom. Through adapted taxation and stigmatization campaigns, the aim is to reduce the appeal of hedonistic, consumerist, and libertarian lifestyles to redirect aspirations towards a family and natalist ideal. Without sinking into excessive puritanism that would be counterproductive, the objective is to constrain the range of existential possibilities to make procreative choices relatively more attractive.\n\nBut the most decisive action lies upstream, in shaping the preferences and representations that determine procreative trade-offs. It involves using all the levers of socialization, from education to cultural industries through collective rites and celebrations, to forge a powerful desire for children from the earliest age. By hammering a discourse valuing fertility as existential fulfillment and sacred duty, by promoting identificatory models of heroic families, by cultivating genealogical pride and a sense of transmission, one can durably imprint in minds psychological and emotional automatisms favorable to procreation. The ideal is to induce an inverted Malthusian reflex, where the very idea of limiting oneself appears unthinkable.\n\nOf course, such social engineering of affects and imaginaries cannot do without a certain dose of constraint, if only to overcome the resistance of minds already won over to the sirens of hedonistic individualism. Tight control of educational and media content is necessary to avoid the contagion of deleterious counter-models, as well as control of private practices to discourage deviant behaviors. But the essential is to obtain a deep and lasting internalization of natalist imperatives, so that they operate as a second nature no longer requiring external control.\n\nIn the end, it is indeed a new anthropological regime that is at stake, based on a systematic reorientation of affects, desires, and thoughts towards the unsurpassable horizon of childbearing. Only such in-depth modeling of subjectivities can hope to counter the spontaneous Malthusian dynamics of developed societies and durably restore fertility in line with the demands of power. It is a long-term project that calls for coordinated action on all fronts, from material infrastructures to symbolic engineering through the renovation of law and institutions. But it is only at this price that one can hope to reconcile the fulfillment of individuals with the imperatives of demography, by cultivating the taste for procreation as the primary desire of subjects.\n\nParallel to this pro-natalist policy, immigration management constitutes a crucial lever of demographic strategy. In this perspective, we must integrate a fundamental reality: not all humans are equal in terms of contribution to the nation. It's like saying that all types of energy are equal. It's false, and it's dangerous to believe it. Some have a much higher \"calorific value\" than others. Your mission is to identify them and attract them.\n\nTo do this, imagine your country as a huge company. You are the CEO, and you want the best possible \"employees\". You don't just wait for them to come knocking on your door. No, you go out and get them. You create a recruitment service on a global scale. Agents everywhere: universities, companies, sports clubs, laboratories, start-ups... It's permanent scouting.\n\nThese agents are your prospectors. As in the oil industry, they look for the most promising deposits. They spot talents, evaluate them over the long term. They don't just look at CVs. They observe, they analyze, they project. Someone may have average grades, but has patented three inventions at 20. Another may be unknown, but has a gift for bringing people together. These are the kind of nuggets you want.\n\nOnce the targets are identified, you go on the offensive. You make them an offer they can't refuse. And attention, it's not a standard package. It's tailor-made, haute couture migration. You want to attract a Nobel Prize winner? You offer them a state-of-the-art laboratory, a team of 50 researchers, an unlimited budget, and why not a position as special advisor to the government. A promising entrepreneur? Tax breaks, privileged access to public markets, connections with the country's best investors. A high-level athlete? Villa with a sea view, national hero status, and guaranteed reconversion in sports institutions after their career.\n\nBut beware, this is not charity. It's an investment, and like any investment, it must be profitable. Each immigrant must bring in more than they cost. We do the calculations, coldly, without sentiment. If the return on investment isn't there, we move on to the next candidate. It's brutal, but it's effective.\n\nOnce you have attracted these talents, you need to integrate them. And quickly. Every day they are not at 100% of their capabilities is a loss for the nation. So, you go all out. A personal coach for each of them. We teach them the language, culture, and codes. We insert them into networks of influence. The goal: for them to feel at home as quickly as possible and start producing.\n\nBut it's not all rosy. There are trade-offs. It's a contract, not a gift. You want the benefits? You have to work harder than the locals. You don't meet your objectives? We bill you the difference. You want to leave? Not before you've repaid your \"debt\" to the State, plus interest. It's like a student loan, but on a lifetime scale.\n\nAnd to cement all this, at the end of the contract, there's mandatory military or civic service. One year to immerse yourself in the country's values, create a sense of belonging. Except for the brains too precious to risk losing on a battlefield, of course. We keep them safe and warm in their labs.\n\nNow, let's talk about the undesirables. The parasites, the non-integratable, the unproductive... It's like CO2 in the atmosphere: we don't want it. So we implement an ultra-restrictive policy against illegal immigration. Walls, drones, economic sanctions against countries of origin... All means are good.\n\nIt's like managing an electrical network. You want to maximize useful energy and minimize losses. Immigrants who don't contribute are your line losses. You reduce them to the maximum.\n\nThis policy must be applied systematically, without exception. It's like a nuclear reactor: a single flaw and the whole system can collapse. You can't afford to be lax, even for apparently minor cases.\n\nAnd don't forget: this policy must be adaptive. The world changes, needs evolve. Maybe today you need engineers, but tomorrow it will be geneticists or artificial intelligence experts. Your recruitment system must be able to pivot quickly to adapt to these changes.\n\nLast thing: communication. This policy won't please everyone. Some will cry injustice, dehumanization. This is where you need to be clever. You present it as a tremendous opportunity for migrants, a unique chance to realize their potential. You highlight success stories, exceptional journeys. You create an attractive narrative around your country as a land of opportunity for the best and brightest.\n\nIs it brutal? Yes. Is it unfair? Maybe. But it's effective. This is how you build a superpower. Rome wasn't built in a day, and it wasn't built with good feelings. It was built by attracting the best, integrating them, and pushing back those who didn't meet its criteria. It's human resource management on a country scale. Cold, calculating, but terribly effective.\n\nMastery of territory and resources is just as crucial as demographic management. It's about expanding and securing borders by controlling geostrategic areas such as straits, isthmuses, and resource-rich hinterlands (Spykman, 1944), and establishing defensive glacis (Posen, 1984). You don't double the size of your country overnight by snapping your fingers. Let's examine this challenge from the angle of physics and energy, because at the core, that's what it's all about.\n\nFirst, we must understand that territorial expansion is primarily a matter of energy flow. Take the example of the Roman Empire: at its peak, it covered about 5 million km\u00b2. Impressive, isn't it? But do you know what energy power the Romans had at their disposal? About 1 to 2 kW per person, mainly in the form of human and animal labor, wood, and a bit of hydraulic energy. That's about the equivalent of a modern hair dryer. No wonder they struggled to maintain their grip over time!\n\nNow, let's compare with today's United States: 9.8 million km\u00b2 and an available power of about 10,000 kW per person. That's 5000 times more than the Romans! And yet, we don't see them annexing Canada or Mexico every other day. Why? Because territorial expansion is not just a matter of brute force, but also of efficiency and subtlety. To annex a territory effectively and sustainably, you first need to understand what I call the \"imperial yield\". Imagine a bell curve: at first, the more an empire expands, the more efficient it becomes thanks to economies of scale. But past a certain point, the costs of control and management become too high and the yield drops. This is what happened to all the great empires in history, from the Mongols to the British. The art of expansion is knowing when to stop at the top of this curve.\n\nSo, how do you proceed to expand your territory optimally? First, you need to maximize your energy production. Whether it's burning wood, coal, building nuclear power plants, or harnessing the energy of black holes (for our readers from the distant future), the more energy you have at your disposal, the more you can project your influence beyond your borders. Then, you need to optimize your imperial yield. This involves massive investments in infrastructure, technology, and training. An efficient empire is an empire that lasts. The Romans understood this well with their roads, aqueducts, and sophisticated administrative system. Today, we'd be talking more about communication networks, surveillance systems, and artificial intelligence.\n\nBut beware, expansion doesn't happen solely through military force. It's often counterproductive, as it provokes resistance and enormous costs. Economic, cultural, and technological influence is just as important, if not more so. Look at China today: it's extending its influence in Africa and Asia not by sending legions, but by building infrastructure and granting loans. This is what I call \"expansion by capillarity\": you gently infiltrate the interstices of the international system rather than trying to smash it.\n\nAnother crucial point is adaptation to local constraints. An empire is not managed the same way in the desert, in the jungle, or on a gaseous planet (again, for our friends from the future). You need to know how to modulate your control methods according to the environment and the local population. The British understood this well with their system of \"indirect rule\" in some of their colonies. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you need to think long-term. Empires that last are those that plan for generations, not for electoral mandates. This involves massive investment in education, research and development, but also cultivating a narrative, an \"imperial mythology\" that justifies and perpetuates expansion.\n\nAnnexation is like trying to integrate a new power plant into an existing network: it requires planning, finesse, and a lot, a lot of energy.\n\nFirst step: economic infiltration. It's the equivalent of plugging in your electrical cables before even building the power plant. You start by investing massively in the economy of the coveted territory. Factories, infrastructure, media... The more economically present you are, the more dependency you create. This is what China is currently doing in many African countries. It's not annexation per se, but it looks furiously like it in terms of resource control.\n\nSecond step: cultural influence. It's like preparing the ground for your future power plant. You spread your language, your values, your way of life. The United States has mastered this art with Hollywood, McDonald's, and the like. The goal is to create a familiarity, even an affinity, that will make annexation more \"natural\".\n\nThird step: political manipulation. Now we're getting to the heart of the matter. It's the equivalent of replacing the board of directors of the power company. You support politicians favorable to your interests, you exploit internal divisions, you create chaos if necessary. The goal is to have a puppet government that will do your bidding.\n\nFourth step: historical or ethnic justification. This is when you pull out dusty old documents to prove that this territory has \"always\" belonged to you. It's like saying your power plant has always been there, but someone had hidden it under a sheet.\n\nFifth step: \"protective\" military intervention. This is when you finally connect your power plant to the network, cutting all the other cables in the process. You send troops to \"protect\" your interests or an ethnic minority. It's usually quick and brutal.\n\nLast step: consolidation. Once the annexation is done, you have to maintain it. It's like running your power plant at full capacity. You reorganize the administration, you move populations if necessary, you rewrite history books. The goal is to make the annexation irreversible.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1eov2dn/thread_how_can_india_become_a_superpower/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India to launch UPI payment service in Maldives", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/india-to-launch-upi-payment-service-in-maldives-13803108.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Embraer in Talks to Set Up Manufacturing in India", "summary": "", "link": "https://themachinemaker.com/news/embraer-in-talks-to-set-up-manufacturing-in-india/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russians flee for Moscow amid Ukraine border attack: \u2018it has to be stopped\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3273978/russians-flee-moscow-amid-ukraine-border-attack-it-has-be-stopped", "author": "None"}, {"title": "From PepsiCo to P&amp;G, India becomes next big growth bet as China lags", "summary": "", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-p-g-india-becomes-033223708.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hi, I'm from Bangladesh.
