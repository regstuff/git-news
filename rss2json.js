He later apologised and admitted he was fighting a losing battle with alcoholism.\n\nLast month, broadcaster TVN reported that the MPs\u2019 bar had until recently had some of the lowest prices for alcohol in Warsaw. They were subsequently raised, but remain below the level in comparable private establishments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre that the cheapest vodka in a bar in the centre of Warsaw can be found in the Sejm building,\u201d said Maciej Konieczny, an MP from the left-wing Together (Razem). \u201cAlcohol shouldn\u2019t be there at all.\u201d\n\nA poll conducted last month by the Opinia24 agency for TVN found that the vast majority of Poles agree: 81% said they support a complete ban on alcohol sales in Sejm buildings.\n\nThe former speaker of the Sejm, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, proposed the idea of breathalyser tests for MP but stopped short of banning the sale of alcohol. \u201cIf someone wants a drink, they\u2019ll find a way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a kindergarten teacher for MPs.\u201d\n\nHowever, under the terms of the coalition agreement that brought Poland\u2019s current government to power, Ho\u0142ownia stepped down last week and was replaced this week by Czarzasty, who has immediately moved to ban sales. The measure goes into effect on 25 November.\n\nHis decision was criticised by PiS MP and former government minister Micha\u0142 W\u00f3jcik, who told Wirtualna Polska that \u201cthe speaker has attacked all members of parliament; he\u2019s made them look like alcoholics\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis undermines the authority of the Sejm,\u201d he added. \u201cIf someone wants to buy alcohol, they\u2019re probably adults, so they\u2019ll go out and buy it.\u201d\n\nIn September, The Left (Lewica) \u2013 one of the members of the ruling coalition \u2013\u00a0[proposed a law](\u00a0that would introduce a nationwide ban on the sale of alcohol in shops at night and in petrol stations at all times of day, as well as prohibiting all forms of alcohol advertising. Czarzasty is one of the leaders of The Left.\n\nShortly afterwards, the centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050), the party led by Ho\u0142ownia and another member of the ruling coalition, tabled its own bill to introduce similar restrictions. Both bills are still being processed by parliament.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/19/new-speaker-bans-sale-of-alcohol-in-polands-parliament-2/", "author": "None"}, {"title":
