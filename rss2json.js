I'm at a place in my life now though where I seriously want to revisit this and feel I am mentally and emotionally...if not financially, able to.\n\nI am from the U.S and still live here but genuinely want to leave. I know some German universities and likely many others around the world have very affordable and perhaps free tuition, even for immigrants. I speak German decently enough, hence why thats my first choice.\n\nI am hoping, however, I can gain some insight from someone else's experience, specifically going from the U.S. to elsewhere if possible, on seeking a master's or Doctorate, as well as the job market in wherever you ended up.\n\nI'm no particularly worried about how much I make, I really just want to be able to have a career I feel I can learn in and enjoy. All of my actual hands on experience is from University, for what thats worth, although I've held a few jobs requiring similar working conditions and functions as an excavation does. So, if someone has some insight I would love to hear! If you have a good source please let me know, I'll check out whatever I can", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1m4ly7x/advice_for_an_relatively_old_archaeology_student/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Japanese-first\u2019 Sanseito party goes into election leveraging unease about foreigners", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/19/japanese-first-sanseito-party-goes-into-election-leveraging-unease-about-foreigners", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India reaches clean power capacity target despite coal reliance", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-EFTA trade pact to be implemented from October 1", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-efta-trade-pact-to-be-implemented-from-october-1-piyush-goyal/article69831327.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Divers Excavated a Lake\u2014and Stumbled Upon a Haunting Ancient Face", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a65436004/ancient-wooden-face-discovery-poland/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At least 36 killed by Israeli fire while seeking aid in Gaza, hospital says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/least-36-killed-by-israeli-fire-while-seeking-aid-gaza-hospital-says-2025-07-19/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More than 30 killed after Israeli forces open fire on people seeking food in Gaza, health ministry says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-food-aid-shooting-intl", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Roman Warrior Goddess on Mount Carmel - Teen spots 1,800-year-old ring while on a hike", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/roman-warrior-goddess-on-mount-carmel", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Proxmox-GitOps - a Self-configuring GitOps Environment for Container Automation in Proxmox VE", "summary": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share my GitOps project for my homelab, a self-configuring CI/CD environment for Proxmox:\n\n\nProxmox-GitOps is built to manage and deploy LXC containers in Proxmox, fully defined as code and easy to modify via Pull Request. Consistent, modular, and dynamically adapting to changing environments and base configurations.\n\nA single command (and accepting the Pull Request in the Docker environment, ha) bootstraps the recursive deployment:\n\n- The Docker-based environment pushes its own codebase as a monorepo, referencing modular components (containers you define are automatically integrated as submodules), each integrated into CI/CD.\n- The pipeline triggers itself \u2014 updating references, enforcing state, and continuing recursively.\n\nProvisioning is handled via Ansible using the Proxmox API. Configuration is managed with Chef/Cinc cookbooks focused on application logic.\nShared configuration is applied consistently across all services. Changes to the base system propagate automatically.\nIt\u2019s easily extensible, aiming to have all containers built the same way. There\u2019s an explanation of how to do this in the README of the repository.\n\nThis project is still young and there are most likely some bugs. I built it primarily for my own homelab, but I\u2019d like to develop it further.  Would really appreciate your input \u2013 even (or especially) if you run into issues. \nThank you in advance for any interest or feedback you have \ud83d\ude42", "link": "https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ollama + ollama-mcp-bridge problem by Open Web UI", "summary": "", "link": "/r/ollama/comments/1m4d1a1/ollama_ollamamcpbridge_problem_by_open_web_ui/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU opens door to funding nuclear energy in next budget", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eu-opens-door-funding-nuclear-energy-next-budget-2025-07-17/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
