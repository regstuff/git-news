Versioning, chaining, automated + human evals, all in one place. It\u2019s been especially useful for debugging failures and actually tracking what improves quality over time.\n* **LangSmith** \u2013 Great for LangChain workflows. You get chain tracing and eval tools, but it\u2019s pretty tied to that ecosystem.\n* **PromptLayer** \u2013 Adds logging and prompt tracking on top of OpenAI APIs. Simple to plug in, but not ideal for complex flows.\n* **Vellum** \u2013 Slick UI for managing prompts and templates. Feels more tailored for structured enterprise teams.\n* **PromptOps** \u2013 Focuses on team features like environments and RBAC. Still early but promising.\n* **PromptTools** \u2013 Open source and dev-friendly. CLI-based, so you get flexibility if you\u2019re hands-on.\n* **Databutton** \u2013 Not strictly a prompt tool, but great for prototyping and experimenting in a notebook-style interface.\n* **PromptFlow (Azure)** \u2013 Built into the Azure ecosystem. Good if you're already using Microsoft tools.\n* **Flowise** \u2013 Low-code builder for chaining models visually. Easy to prototype ideas quickly.\n* **CrewAI / DSPy** \u2013 Not prompt tools per se, but really useful if you're working with agents or structured prompting.\n\n**A few great suggestions from last week\u2019s thread:**\n\n* **AgentMark** \u2013 Early-stage but interesting. Focuses on evaluation for agent behavior and task completion.\n* **MuseBox.io** \u2013 Lets you run quick evaluations with human feedback. Handy for creative or subjective tasks.\n* **Secondisc** \u2013 More focused on prompt tracking and history across experiments. Lightweight but useful.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, **Maxim**, **PromptTools**, and **AgentMark** all try to tackle prompt quality head-on, but with different angles. **Maxim** stands out if you're looking for an all-in-one workflow, versioning, testing, chaining, and evals, especially when you\u2019re building apps or agents that actually ship.\n\nLet me know if there are others I should check out, I\u2019ll keep the list growing!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mc4ifr/best_tools_for_prompt_engineering_2025/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nayara Energy moved Delhi HC against Microsoft over suspension of services", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/nayara-energy-moved-delhi-hc-against-microsoft-over-suspension-of-services/article69865880.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shelter dog credited with recognizing man's seizure gets adopted", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/shelter-dog-credited-recognizing-mans-seizure-gets-adopted/story?id=123549634", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Palestinian activist featured in Oscar-winning movie shot dead during clash with settlers", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-activist-featured-in-oscar-winning-movie-shot-dead-during-clash-with-settlers/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "trl suddenly update to 0.20.0, unsloth have to fix something  now.", "summary": "Hey guys, when i was finetuning Qwen model in the morining today , everything works fine. but after i finish ed my lunch i started a notebook from kaggle and import unsloth, i meet some dependences issues with trl. so i check pypi and found that trl have a update today. so now it  will have error with import unsloth when you install unsloth from pip. \n\nwell, now i use the trl==0.19.1 to not raise error.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1mc6i5z/trl_suddenly_update_to_0200_unsloth_have_to_fix/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Improve every prompt you send (Meta Memory)", "summary": "\nThis will restructure every prompt you send, refining it and amplifying your intent.
