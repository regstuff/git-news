This is where India\u2019s hegemonic ambitions and domestic insecurities come into view. The self-critical note offered a patronising psychological analysis of Bangladesh. First, \u2018intense anti-India and anti-Hindu propaganda\u2019 before 1971 left a \u2018residue\u2019 in the subconscious Muslim minds. Second, the disconnect between East Pakistan and India meant that Bangladeshis didn\u2019t understand India and believed all propaganda (despite the report acknowledging that Bangladeshi charges against India after 1971 were accurate). Third, being a small new nation, Bangladesh had a \u2018natural sense of inferiority, which every \u2018aided\u2019 nation resents\u2019.\n\nThe note advocated a \u2018mature\u2019 long-term approach that aimed to strengthen pro-India lobbies, and sought a \u2018cultural conquest\u2019 that would expose Bangladeshis to Indian secularism and ally with the Soviets to forestall the US-China-Pakistan nexus. Anything that undermined India\u2019s \u2018unipolarity in Bangladesh\u2019 in the long term must be avoided. But in the near future, New Delhi had to convince Zia not to confront India. On 2 January 1976, R&amp;AW Joint Secretary N Framji Suntook, who became chief of R&amp;AW a year later, authored a top-secret note on the strengths and weaknesses of the Bangladeshi government and the opposition groups such as the JSD and Kader Bahini. He noted that \u2018emphasis on Islamic identity by the majority community\u2019 coupled with the rise of China and Pakistan was bad for India. Suntook listed what Pakistan\u2019s mission would do in Bangladesh and how India must \u2018counteract\u2019.\n\nIn R&amp;AW\u2019s reading, Pakistan was planning to post 100\u2013150 personnel in Dacca and open a consulate in Chittagong. Such a footprint would allow the ISI to exploit the \u2018old boys network\u2019, and have pervasive influence in Bangladeshi ministries. It risked exposing India\u2019s problems with Bangladesh \u2018from A to Z\u2019 making Pakistan the \u2018invisible third party exercising influence\u2019 in bilateral negotiations on boundary settlement and water sharing. Pakistan could infiltrate Bangladeshi media and educational institutions to foment pro-Islamic, pro-Pakistani feelings, and encourage anti-India and anti-Hindu sentiments.\n\nOnce things started going their way, \u2018Pakistan may promote the idea of a confederation\u2019 with Bangladesh. Why? Because Bhutto viewed Bangladesh\u2019s proximity to India\u2019s northeast as a strategic advantage and believed this region \u2018had the potential of developing into another Viet Nam\u2019. True to style, Bhutto met with Mizo rebel leader Laldenga in 1973 to reassess Pakistan\u2019s support after the 1971 setback. Suntook believed that Pakistan would also support Naxalites and fuel disaffection against India in Nepal. Zia\u2019s conservative nationalism, viewed from this perspective, was anathema.\n\nSuntook recommended an aggressive campaign. For starters, India needed to broaden and deepen its intelligence gathering system to track Pakistani operations. Such measures included cross-governmental coordination with the State Trading Corporation, Aid, Shipping, Coal Board, and so on who dealt with Bangladesh. Suntook proposed maintaining \u2018steady pressure\u2019 on Dacca about Pakistani activities, and to \u2018make it clear to the leaders of Bengla Desh that their alignment with Pakistan would pose a threat to our security and would not be acceptable beyond a point\u2019. Close cultural ties that \u2018keep the memories of the freedom struggle\u2019 and the \u2018atrocities committed by Pakistan alive\u2019 were also recommended. For this, the scale of India\u2019s cultural activities needed to be on a scale \u2018comparable to that of the Americans and the Russians in India\u2019.\n\nBut there was a sharper edge to R&amp;AW\u2019s strategy. After mapping out the who\u2019s who that could target Zia\u2019, Suntook recommended all \u2018feasible measures\u2019 to \u2018soften up areas which are contiguous to Indian territories\u2019. In security parlance, this meant arming the Shanti and Kader Bahinis, and AL rebels such as Suttar (known to R&amp;AW as \u2018Chittu babu\u2019).\n\nThen came Suntook\u2019s final blow:\n\n&gt; \u2026serious thought should be given to the idea of providing strong support to anti-Pakistani activities in NWFP, and Baluchistan now being carried on from bases in Afghanistan. To relieve Pakistani pressure on India through Bengla Desh, it may be necessary to intensify pressure on Pakistan through Afghanistan to the extent that it is feasible to do so.\n\nSuntook\u2019s recommendations echoed bureaucratic consensus and became policy until Gandhi lost power in March 1977. Zia came to believe that R&amp;AW was after his life. After coming to power, he prevented an Indian intervention by not declaring Bangladesh an Islamic republic. But he faced intense pressure by anti-regime elements, all of whom received covert Indian support. Officially, India communicated to the US that it was \u2018calm and cool\u2019 about Bangladesh and acknowledged that large-scale persecution of Hindus was not happening. Unofficially, it pressured Zia.\n\nUS intelligence noted that the BSF opened more training camps after November 1975 for anti-Zia rebels. By August 1976, India helped an estimated \u2018two to three thousand\u2019 such elements to cross over into Bangladesh. Cross-border violence by India-trained rebels became routine in 1976. Such kinetic support to the Shanti Bahni was accompanied by relocation of Chakma refugees to Arunachal Pradesh. To augment infiltration, the BSF launched a big operation on 20 April 1976 at the Bandarkata border post in Mymensingh. Sylhet and the Meghalaya-Tangail/Mymensigh border areas were specific points where India increased pressure. Many of these India-trained \u2018miscreants\u2019 created \u2018instability\u2019 with the \u2018ultimate objective of overthrowing the existing government\u2019.\n\nCertain members of the Gono Bahini, the JSD\u2019s armed wing, joined the Kader Bahini. By May 1976, India had trained the first batch of Shanti Bahini fighters in Dehradun and Haflong, Assam. By 1979, 700 Chakma fighters received training and most of the 150,000 displaced Chakmas were relocated. Just before Gandhi lost power, R&amp;AW asked the Shanti Bahini for a \u2018big push forward\u2019 with the promise of expanding its cadre to 15,000. For his part, Suttar intensified the Bangabhumi movement for a separate Hindu state in Bangladesh. Little understood, the Bangabhumi movement resonated with Bangladeshi Hindus. \u2018Our relationship with Suttar was very benign\u2019 and the operational understanding \u2018deep\u2019 says an Indian intelligence officer with knowledge of these matters.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1jbayza/the_shadow_war_doctrine_raws_1970s_strategy_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India, Bangladesh conduct naval exercise amid diplomatic chill | India News - The Times of India", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bangladesh-conduct-naval-exercise-amid-diplomatic-chill/articleshow/118980068.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China\u2019s Growing Concerns Over India-US Relations", "summary": "", "link": "https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/chinas-growing-concerns-over-india-us-relations/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh: Fierce protests as eight-year-old rape victim dies", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce30k9g6x2eo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How was Glassdoor able to do this?", "summary": "# \"Top review highlights by sentiment\n\nExcerpts from user reviews, not authored by Glassdoor\n\nPros\n\n* \"[Dynamic working environment](\u00a0(in 14 reviews)\n* \"[good benefit](\u00a0and healthcare\"\u00a0(in 11 reviews)\n* \"[Friendly colleagues](\u00a0(in 6 reviews)\n* \"[Great people](\u00a0and overall strategy\"\u00a0(in 6 reviews)\n* \"workers,\u00a0[good managers](\u00a0(in 5 reviews)\n\nCons\n\n* \"[low salary](\u00a0and a lot of stress\"\u00a0(in 13 reviews)\n* \"[Work life balance can be challenging](\u00a0(in 6 reviews)\n* \"under\u00a0[high pressure](\u00a0working environment\"\u00a0(in 5 reviews)\n* \"Not\u00a0[much work](\u00a0to do\"\u00a0(in 4 reviews)\n* \"[Low bonus](\u00a0like Tet holiday bonus\"\u00a0(in 3 reviews)\n* Top review highlights by sentiment\n\nExcerpts from user reviews, not authored by Glassdoor\"\n\nSomething like Bertopic was not able to produce this level of granularity. \n\nI'm thinking they do clustering first, then a summarization model.
