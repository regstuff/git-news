Nearly 6.9 million people died due to COVID-19.\nAnd if you\u2019re a bit familiar with history, your answer might be that the worst year was 1918, the year World War I ended, after claiming the lives of around 20 million people. In addition, the Spanish flu swept the globe, killing between 50 to 100 million people.\n\nBut did you know that there's something even worse? A year that is described as the worst in recorded history...\n\n1. The Mysterious Fog:\nIn the year 536 AD, the year began with a mysterious thick fog that covered vast parts of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. It completely blocked out the sun.\nProcopius described the sun at that time: \u201cIt seemed as though the sun had lost its light, and it no longer shone with the brilliance of day, but rather as the moon, without rays or warmth, for more than a year.\u201d\nThe Roman statesman Cassiodorus also wrote: \u201cThe sunlight was weak, the sky appeared colorless, the cold pierced to the bone, and it was as if summer had been defeated by winter.\u201d\n\n2. Catastrophic Climate Change:\nTemperatures dropped by 2 to 2.5 degrees Celsius in some regions, causing the worst cold spell the Northern Hemisphere had experienced in the past two thousand years.\n\n3. Widespread Famines:\nThe climate shift led to the failure of harvests across Europe and Asia, resulting in massive famines, particularly in places like Ireland, Syria, and Byzantium.\n\n4. The Spread of Plagues:\nAfter this climate catastrophe and the ensuing famines, rats emerged from their hiding places in search of food, increasing their contact with humans. The fleas on these rats, which feed on blood, began infecting humans.\nDue to the general decline in public health and malnutrition, the world was struck by the Plague of Justinian, or the \u201cBlack Plague,\u201d in the year 541 AD\u2014just five years later.\nThis pandemic killed between 30 to 50 million people, nearly half of the population of the Byzantine Empire.\nThe economy and military were weakened, trade came to a standstill, and this accelerated Europe\u2019s descent into what became known as the Dark Ages.\n\n\"The Triumph of Death is a painting by the Flemish artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, created in 1562.\"", "link": "https://i.redd.it/myw5dr5jcsve1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prompt Compression \u2013 Exploring ways to reduce LLM output tokens through prompt shaping", "summary": "Hi all \u2014 I\u2019ve been experimenting with a small idea I call **Prompt Compression**, and I\u2019m curious whether others here have explored anything similar or see potential value in it.\n\nJust to clarify upfront: **this work is focused entirely on black-box LLMs accessed via API** \u2014 like OpenAI\u2019s models, Claude, or similar services. I don\u2019t have access to model internals, training data, or fine-tuning. The only levers available are **prompt design and response interpretation**.\n\nGiven that constraint, I\u2019ve been trying to reduce token usage (both input and output) \u2014 not by post-processing, but by shaping the exchange itself through prompt structure.\n\nSo far, I see two sides to this:\n\n# 1. Input Compression (fully controllable)\n\nThis is the more predictable path: pre-processing the prompt before sending it to the model, using techniques like:\n\n* removing redundant or verbose phrasing\n* simplifying instructions\n* summarizing context blocks\n\nIt\u2019s deterministic and relatively easy to implement \u2014 though the savings are often modest (\\~10\u201320%).\n\n# 2. Output Compression (semi-controllable)\n\nThis is where it gets more exploratory. The goal is to influence the *style and verbosity* of the model\u2019s output through subtle prompt modifiers like:\n\n* \u201cBe concise\u201d\n* \u201cList 3 bullet points\u201d\n* \u201cRespond briefly and precisely\u201d\n* \u201cWrite like a telegram\u201d\n\nSometimes it works surprisingly well, reducing output by 30\u201340%. Other times it has minimal effect. It feels like \u201csteering with soft levers\u201d \u2014 but can be meaningful when every token counts (e.g. in production chains or streaming).\n\n# Why I\u2019m asking here:\n\nI\u2019m currently developing a small open-source tool that tries to systematize this process \u2014 but more importantly, I\u2019m curious if anyone in this community has tried something similar.\n\n# I\u2019d love to hear:\n\n* Have you experimented with compressing or shaping LLM outputs via prompt design?\n* Are there known frameworks, resources, or modifier patterns that go beyond the usual temperature and max\\_tokens controls?\n* Do you see potential use cases for this in your own work or tools?\n\nThanks for reading \u2014 I\u2019d really appreciate any pointers, critiques, or even disagreement.

As a note, I'm technical, but I didn't want to learn how to use an AI agent framework. I just wanted a fast way to get started. Here are my thoughts:\n\n**Sim Studio**  \nSim Studio is a Figma-like drag-and-drop interface to build AI agents. It's also open source.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Super easy and fast drag-and-drop builder\n* Open source with full transparency\n* Trace all your workflow executions to see cost (you can bring your own API keys, which makes it free to use)\n* Deploy your workflows as an API, or run them on a schedule\n* Connect to tools like Slack, Gmail, Pinecone, Supabase, etc.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Smaller community compared to other platforms\n* Still building out tools\n\n**LangGraph**  \nLangGraph is built by LangChain and designed specifically for AI agent orchestration. It's powerful but has an unfriendly UI.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Deep integration with the LangChain ecosystem\n* Excellent for creating advanced reasoning patterns\n* Strong support for stateful agent behaviors\n* Robust community with corporate adoption (Replit, Uber, LinkedIn)\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Steeper learning curve\n* More code-heavy approach\n* Less intuitive for visualizing complex workflows\n* Requires stronger programming background\n\n**n8n**  \nn8n is a general workflow automation platform that has added AI capabilities. While not specifically built for AI agents, it offers extensive integration possibilities.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Already built out hundreds of integrations\n* Able to create complex workflows\n* Lots of documentation\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* AI capabilities feel added-on rather than core\n* Harder to use (especially to get started)\n* Learning curve\n\n**Why I Chose Sim Studio**  \nAfter experimenting with all three platforms, I found myself gravitating toward Sim Studio for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Really Fast**: Getting started was super fast and easy. It took me a few minutes to create my first agent and deploy it as a chatbot.\n2. **Building Experience**: With LangGraph, I found myself spending too much time writing code rather than designing agent behaviors. Sim Studio's simple visual approach let me focus on the agent logic first.\n3. **Balance of Simplicity and Power**: It hit the sweet spot between ease of use and capability. I could build simple flows quickly, but also had access to deeper customization when needed.\n\n**My Experience So Far**  \nI've been using Sim Studio for a few days now, and I've already built several multi-agent workflows that would have taken me much longer with code-only approaches. The visual experience has also made it easier to collaborate with team members who aren't as technical.\n\nThe ability to test and optimize my workflows within the same platform has helped me refine my agents' performance without constant code deployment cycles. And when I needed to dive deeper, the open-source nature meant I could extend functionality to suit my specific needs.\n\nFor anyone looking to build AI agent workflows without getting lost in implementation details, I highly recommend giving Sim Studio a try. Have you tried any of these tools?
