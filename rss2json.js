We then trained it from the last checkpoint for another thousand epochs on new data (9k rows new data+3k rows of the old data) that was augmented with noise, but now it doesn't perform well on clean audio recordings but works much better in noisy data.\n\nI think the best option would be to fine tune it on the entire data both noisy and clean, just that it'll be more computationally expensive and I want to make sure if what I'm doing makes sense before using up my credits for GPU. My teammates are convinced we can just keep fine-tuning on more data and the model won't forget its old knowledge, but I think otherwise.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1kegziy/finetuning_whisper_from_the_last_checkpoint_on/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Geopolitical Insights: Pahalgam Terror Attack and China-Pakistan Nexus", "summary": "", "link": "https://unravellinggeopolitics.com/2025/05/04/india-kashmir-pahalgam-terror-attack-china-pakistan-nexus/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pseudoarchaeologists Jimmy Corsetti and Dan Richards called out for promoting misinformation and conspiracy theories against Gobekli Tepe.", "summary": "", "link": "https://youtu.be/dlR75M-tSvo?si=qlRAuFaynCwA4SbY", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Woman who went missing at bus stop more than 60 years ago and not heard from since found \u2018alive and well\u2019 by police", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/woman-missing-60-years-found-alive-2067741", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistani trooper crosses over to Indian side, gets arrested by BSF", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistani-trooper-crosses-over-to-indian-side-gets-arrested-by-bsf/amp_articleshow/120858844.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Beginner's question about unsloth.", "summary": "Note:I am using a translator.

I organise the data and enhance the datasets with additional tags from things like aspect-based sentiment analysis, NER, and semantic categories from Empath. \n\nDoing this has allowed me to better slice and compare observations that match certain criteria / research question (I.e., analyse all Reddit data on \u2018ergonomic chairs\u2019 where the aspect is \u2018lumbar-support\u2019, the sentiment negative and the entity is \u2018Herman Miller\u2019, for example). \n\nThis works well and also allows LLMs to ingest this more structured and concise data for summaries etc.\n\nHowever I feel I am hitting a wall in what I can extract. I\u2019d like to ask whether there are any additional methods I should be using to tag, organise and analyse these types of conversational data to extract insights relating to user / market challenges?

I am a Canadian student graduating with my undergrad degree in archaeology in anthropology this spring. I have been applying for lots of different jobs in the field, the most common of which for someone with my level of expertise is a field technician. I have received two job offers for this type of position, both similar in pay being hourly or daily and dependent on the duration of individual projects. In Canada, field season when these projects take place is normally from May to October/November. Part of me is worried that if the field season is not busy with lots of projects that I will not be able to make a livable wage inbetween projects.\n\nThis leads me to asking for the thoughts of those who have done similar types of work in archaeology before: Is it often livable? Or do/did find yourself taking on casual/part-time positions elsewhere, maybe even unrelated to archaeology? If so, what are the nature or logistics of these other positions (ie. are places like restaurants normally okay with hiring a server that will be gone for a couple weeks to do projects and then come back to be available for work for a week or so?)?\n\nSimilarly, I was curious what others with this type of position typically do in the off season when field work projects are not taking place? I know sometimes that companies will keep a crew during winter to help with research and lab work, but that normally seems to take a smaller team. Are there other positions related to archaeology available in the off season that I am unaware of, or do most just take an unrelated job during this time as well?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1keuf5b/those_who_have_worked_as_field_technicians_what/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
