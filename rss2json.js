Archaeologists in North Jutland have uncovered a 4,000-year-old timber circle, strikingly similar in design and orientation to Stonehenge and Woodhenge in England.\n\nThis find underscores the deep connections between our ancestors, their shared worldviews, and their advanced understanding of agriculture, astronomy, and ritual practices. The monument\u2019s alignment suggests a common cultural thread stretching across the North Sea, highlighting the long-standing ties between Denmark and the UK\u2014ties that continue to thrive today.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/26/stonehenge-circle-unearthed-denmark-woodhenge?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3puI8nnpWDtgS3bXEywuGFxSw79IZ2WtgKBZyG_3mRs6e6PBXyL0bMVA8_aem_AMGeSfTLwM6IfK9vJwPuHA", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Progzee - an open source python package for ethical scraping use cases.

Vance. Trump, betraying his reality television origins, remarked towards the end of the remarkable episode, \u201cThis is going to be great television, I will say that.\u201d \n\nIt may have made for great entertainment\u2014the circuses part of the Roman \u2018panem et circenses\u2019\u2014but it threatens global stability. Some worry that this event is as significant as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in June 1914, which triggered the First World War. Even if it is not a prelude to another world war, New Delhi should be worried about everything that has transpired since Trump won the American presidential election last year.\n\nDespite numerous conflicts and humanitarian tragedies, the world has seen relative stability\u2014and to an extent, peace\u2014since the end of the Second World War. This order was established by two superpowers during the Cold War and, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, by the unipolar dominance of the US. After the Cold War ended, two countries benefitted the most from the direction the world took: China and India. \n\nTrump has upended that global order. Friday\u2019s fracas with Zelenskyy was perhaps the final push to overturn the geopolitical chessboard. New Delhi now faces the challenge of surviving global disorder rather than thriving in it.\n\nCoupled with this are some of Trump\u2019s economic policies. He has doubled down on reciprocal tariffs against Indian exports to the US, warned against manufacturing Tesla vehicles in India, and proposed that India buy more defence equipment from the US, while targeting Indian immigrants, documented or not. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to placate him, but as we know from the experience of other world leaders, this hasn\u2019t budged Trump from his positions. Modi had placed considerable confidence in his close friendship with Trump which, as it seems, isn\u2019t working, and there are no new ideas. As a result, India is banking on hope and luck.\n\nIndia should be extremely troubled by the arguments put forth by the Trump-Vance duo in their attack on Zelenskyy. They legitimized Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s blatantly illegal action to invade and occupy Ukraine, which violated the established principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries. India\u2019s case against Chinese aggression in Ladakh or Arunachal Pradesh, though not as blatant or widespread as Moscow\u2019s, is based on the same principles.\n\nIf might makes right in Trump\u2019s worldview, India should be alarmed given China\u2019s superior size and power. This was confessed by the external affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, in one of his unguarded moments to ANI: \u201cLook, they (China) are the bigger economy. What am I going to do? As a smaller economy, I am going to pick up a fight with the bigger economy. It is not a question of being reactionary, it\u2019s a question of common sense.\u201d\n\nIndia looks to the US as a strong ally. In February 2023, Indian defence secretary Giridhar Aramane was at a public forum in Washington D.C. He publicly acknowledged the US for its critical support in intelligence, information sharing, and military equipment during the border crisis with China. Thereafter, he specifically mentioned the support expected from the US in such scenarios. \u201cWe are there, we are standing against a bully in a very determined fashion,\u201d he claimed. \u201cAnd we expect that our friend, the US, will be there with us in case we need their support.\" \n\nNothing much has changed for India\u2019s military since 2023. If anything, the situation has worsened, as the air force chief reminded us on Friday. To counter a strategic threat like China, India needs US support, which is no longer assured under Trump. His admiration for Xi Jinping and desire for a deal with Beijing should give India nightmares.\n\nIf Ukraine is fair game for Putin, then Beijing would certainly sense an opportunity to fulfill its longstanding goal of getting Taiwan. Except for the US, no other country can help deter or stop China from doing so. Once Beijing lays its hands on Taiwan, the only other territory it claims as its own is Arunachal Pradesh. Ladakh may have seen much trouble since 2020, but China more or less possesses what it claims in that area. It is the eastern sector that India has to be concerned about, especially with how the Modi government has mishandled its ties with Bangladesh and Nepal. \n\nIndia\u2019s strategic vulnerability is in the Siliguri corridor, which is barely 40 km from the Chinese territory of Chumbi Valley. It is the only ground link between north Bengal and northeast India, with all others going through Bangladesh. The shortest expanse of the Chicken Neck, as it is also called, is 20 km, between Naxalbari on the India-Nepal border and Phansidewa on the India-Bangladesh border. At its narrowest between Bhutan and Bangladesh, the corridor is only 43 km wide. In 2017, the Indian army went into Doklam in Bhutan to stop Chinese soldiers from accessing the Jampheri ridge because it threatened the Siliguri Corridor. The Chinese are now firmly ensconced in the Doklam plateau while Indians are making concessions to PLA patrols in Arunachal as part of the understanding reached in October last year. \n\nThe situation is dire, far away from the choreographed images of Modi-Xi meetings and Jaishankar-Wang Yi handshakes. \n\nTrump\u2019s latest antics against Zelenskyy only exacerbate the problem. Surprisingly, some Indian commentators (here, here and here) have criticized Zelenskyy for this interaction. Some may believe in Modi\u2019s \u2018MAGA+MIGA= Mega\u2019 formula (MAGA is Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again, while MIGA, as per Modi, is the English version of Viksit Bharat, Make India Great Again). Or they could agree with Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni when she recently included Modi in the coalition of the right-wing leaders alongside Trump, Argentina President Javier Milei and her. Others may be driven by their sympathy for the Russian president, seemingly oblivious to the potential consequences it has for India. \n\nTrump is dangerous, destructive and damaging. His antics with Zelenskyy ought to make that clear. Entertainment be damned, that is why we should be paying attention to what happened on Friday afternoon in the White House.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1j0zdwt/trumps_white_house_drama_with_zelenskyy_creates/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ARIA: AI Responsibility and Integration Assistant", "summary": "After some years of silence (I was one of the Remmina maintainers), I'm excited to share [ARIA]( (Artificial Intelligence Regulation Interface &amp; Agreements), an open-source framework for defining boundaries between human and AI contributors in software projects.\n\n## What ARIA Does\n\nAs AI coding tools become more prevalent, ARIA helps teams establish clear policies for how AI should interact with their codebase:\n\n- Creates standardized YAML policies for AI participation in codebases\n- Provides policy templates with different permission models (Guardian, Observer, Assistant)\n- Integrates with IDEs like Windsurf and Cursor (WIP, nvim/vim and Emacs too)\n- Converts policies to IDE-specific rules and ignore files\n\nThe [documentation]( includes guides, examples, and technical details.\n\n## Project Status\n\nARIA is currently in alpha (v0.1.1).
