While they are powerful techniques in theory, in practice they often quietly fail. Instead of improving quality, they tend to amplify hallucinations, reinforce shallow critiques, or produce fragmented solutions that never fully connect.\n\nIt\u2019s not the method itself, but how these loops are structured, how critique is framed, and whether synthesis, feedback, and uncertainty are built into the process. Without these, recursion and decomposition often make outputs sound more confident while staying just as wrong.\n\nHere\u2019s what GPT says is the key failure points behind recursive prompting and task breakdown along with strategies and prompt designs grounded in what has been shown to work. \n\nTL;DR: Most recursive prompting and breakdown loops quietly reinforce hallucinations instead of fixing errors. The problem is in how they\u2019re structured. Here\u2019s where they fail and how we can optimize for reasoning that\u2019s accurate. \n\n\u2014\n\nRSIP (Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting) and CAD (Context-Aware Decomposition) are promising techniques for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). But without the right structure, they often underperform \u2014 leading to hallucination loops, shallow self-critiques, or fragmented outputs.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nLimitations of Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting (RSIP)\n\n1. Limited by the Model\u2019s Existing Knowledge\n\nWithout external feedback or new data, RSIP loops just recycle what the model already \u201cknows.\u201d This often results in rephrased versions of the same ideas, not actual improvement.\n\n2. Overconfidence and Reinforcement of Hallucinations\n\nLLMs frequently express high confidence even when wrong. Without outside checks, self-critique risks reinforcing mistakes instead of correcting them.\n\n3. High Sensitivity to Prompt Wording\n\nRSIP success depends heavily on how prompts are written. Small wording changes can cause the model to either overlook real issues or \u201cfix\u201d correct content, making the process unstable.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nChallenges in Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD)\n\n1. Losing the Big Picture\n\nDecomposing complex tasks into smaller steps is easy \u2014 but models often fail to reconnect these parts into a coherent whole.\n\n2. Extra Complexity and Latency\n\nManaging and recombining subtasks adds overhead. Without careful synthesis, CAD can slow things down more than it helps.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nConclusion\n\nRSIP and CAD are valuable tools for improving reasoning in LLMs \u2014 but both have structural flaws that limit their effectiveness if used blindly. External critique, clear evaluation criteria, and thoughtful decomposition are key to making these methods work as intended.\n\nWhat follows is a set of research-backed strategies and prompt templates to help you leverage RSIP and CAD reliably.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nHow to Effectively Leverage Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting (RSIP) and Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD)\n\n1. Define Clear Evaluation Criteria\n\nResearch Insight:\nVague critiques like \u201cimprove this\u201d often lead to cosmetic edits. Tying critique to specific evaluation dimensions (e.g., clarity, logic, factual accuracy) significantly improves results.\n\nPrompt Templates:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cIn this review, focus on the clarity of the argument. Are the ideas presented in a logical sequence?\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cNow assess structure and coherence.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cFinally, check for factual accuracy. Flag any unsupported claims.\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Limit Self-Improvement Cycles\n\nResearch Insight:\nSelf-improvement loops tend to plateau \u2014 or worsen \u2014 after 2\u20133 iterations. More loops can increase hallucinations and contradictions.\n\nPrompt Templates:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cConduct up to three critique cycles. After each, summarize what was improved and what remains unresolved.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cIn the final pass, combine the strongest elements from previous drafts into a single, polished output.\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Perspective Switching\n\nResearch Insight:\nPerspective-switching reduces blind spots. Changing roles between critique cycles helps the model avoid repeating the same mistakes.\n\nPrompt Templates:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cReview this as a skeptical reader unfamiliar with the topic. What\u2019s unclear?\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cNow critique as a subject matter expert. Are the technical details accurate?\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cFinally, assess as the intended audience. Is the explanation appropriate for their level of knowledge?\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. Require Synthesis After Decomposition (CAD)\n\nResearch Insight:\nTask decomposition alone doesn\u2019t guarantee better outcomes. Without explicit synthesis, models often fail to reconnect the parts into a meaningful whole.\n\nPrompt Templates:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cList the key components of this problem and propose a solution for each.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cNow synthesize: How do these solutions interact? Where do they overlap, conflict, or depend on each other?\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cWrite a final summary explaining how the parts work together as an integrated system.\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. Enforce Step-by-Step Reasoning (\u201cReasoning Journal\u201d)\n\nResearch Insight:\nTraceable reasoning reduces hallucinations and encourages deeper problem-solving (as shown in reflection prompting and scratchpad studies).\n\nPrompt Templates:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cMaintain a reasoning journal for this task. For each decision, explain why you chose this approach, what assumptions you made, and what alternatives you considered.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cSummarize the overall reasoning strategy and highlight any uncertainties.\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\n6. Cross-Model Validation\n\nResearch Insight:\nModel-specific biases often go unchecked without external critique. Having one model review another\u2019s output helps catch blind spots.\n\nPrompt Templates:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cCritique this solution produced by another model. Do you agree with the problem breakdown and reasoning? Identify weaknesses or missed opportunities.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cIf you disagree, suggest where revisions are needed.\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\n7. Require Explicit Assumptions and Unknowns\n\nResearch Insight:\nModels tend to assume their own conclusions. Forcing explicit acknowledgment of assumptions improves transparency and reliability.\n\nPrompt Templates:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cBefore finalizing, list any assumptions made. Identify unknowns or areas where additional data is needed to ensure accuracy.\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cHighlight any parts of the reasoning where uncertainty remains high.\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\n8. Maintain Human Oversight\n\nResearch Insight:\nHuman-in-the-loop remains essential for reliable evaluation. Model self-correction alone is insufficient for robust decision-making.\n\nPrompt Reminder Template:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cProvide your best structured draft. Do not assume this is the final version. Reserve space for human review and revision.\u201d\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k89utm/common_mistakes_that_cause_hallucinations_when/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - darkterminal/mylibsqladmin: MylibSQLAdmin - A Modern libSQL (SQLite compatible) Database Management System (libSQL Server GUI)", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/darkterminal/mylibsqladmin", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I created a step-by-step video walkthrough for installing openwebui &amp; ollama as docker containers in WSL2 for Nvidia GPU users", "summary": "hey guys!

However, I crafted a reply because I'm working on developing a workshop for generating taxonomies/metadata schemas with LLM assistance, so it's a good case study for me, and I'd be interested in your thoughts, questions, and feedback. I assume the person who wrote the original post has long moved on from the project he (or she) was working on. I didn't write the prompts, just the general guidance and sample templates for outputs.  \n  \n**Here is what I wanted to comment:**\n\nBased on the discussion so far, here's the kind of approach I would suggest. Your exact implementation would depend on your specific tools and workflow.\n\n1. Create a JSON data capture template\n   * Design a JSON object that captures key data and facts from each report.\n   * Fields should cover specific parameters you anticipate needing (e.g., weather conditions, pilot experience, type of accident).\n2. Prompt the LLM to fill the template for each accident report\n   * Instruct the LLM to:\n      * Populate the JSON fields.\n      * Include a *verbatim quote* and *reference* (e.g., line number or descriptive location) from the report for each extracted fact.\n3. Compile the structured data\n   * Collect all filled JSON outputs together (you can dump them all in a Google Doc for example)\n   * This forms a structured sample body for taxonomy development.\n4. Create a SKOS-compliant taxonomy template\n   * Store the finalized taxonomy in a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets) using SKOS principles (concept ID, preferred label, alternate label, definition, broader/narrower relationships, example).\n5. Prompt the LLM to synthesize allowed values for each parameter\n   * Create a prompt that analyzes the compiled JSON records and proposes allowed values (categories) for each parameter.\n   * Allow the LLM to also suggest new parameters if patterns emerge.\n   * Populate the SKOS template with the proposed values. This becomes your standard taxonomy file.\n6. Use the taxonomy for future classification\n   * When new accident reports come in:\n      * Provide the SKOS taxonomy file as project knowledge.\n      * Ask the LLM to classify and structure the new report according to the established taxonomy.\n      * Allow the LLM to suggest new concepts that emerge as it processes new reports. Add them to the taxonomy spreadsheet as you see fit.\n\n\\-------\n\n**Here's an example of what the JSON template could look like:**\n\n    {\n    \u00a0\"report_id\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\"report_excerpt_reference\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\"weather_conditions\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"pilot_experience_level\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"surface_conditions\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"equipment_status\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"accident_type\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"injury_severity\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"primary_cause\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"secondary_factors\": {\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"value\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"quote\": \"\",\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"reference_location\": \"\"\n    \u00a0},\n    \u00a0\u00a0\"notes\": \"\"\n    }\n\n\\-----\n\n**Here's what a SKOS-compliant template would look like with 3 sample rows:**\n\n||\n||\n|concept\\_id|prefLabel|altLabel(s)|broader|narrower|definition|example|\n|wx|Weather Conditions|Weather||wx.sunny, wx.wind|Description of weather during flight|\"Clear, sunny day\"|\n|wx.sunny|Sunny|Clear Skies|wx||Sky mostly free of clouds|\"No clouds observed\"|\n|wx.wind|Windy Conditions|Wind|wx|wx.wind.light, wx.wind.strong|Presence of wind affecting flight|\"Moderate gusts\"|\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* concept\\_id is the anchor (can be simple IDs for now).\n* altLabel comes in handy for different ways of expressing the same concept.

New reports are then classified using the taxonomy.\n\nWhat this achieves:\n\n* Strong traceability (every extracted fact tied to a quote)\n* Low hallucination risk during extraction\n* Organic taxonomy growth based on real-world data patterns\n* Easier auditing and future reclassification as the system matures\n\nMain risks:\n\n* Missing data if reports are vague or poorly written\n* Extraction inconsistencies (different wording for same concepts)\n* Setup overhead (initial design of templates and prompts)\n* Taxonomy drift as new phenomena emerge over time\n* Mild hallucination risk during allowed value synthesis\n\nMitigation strategies:\n\n* Prompt the LLM to leave fields empty if no quote matches (\"Do not infer or guess missing information.\")\n* Run a second pass on the extracted taxonomy items to consolidate similar terms (use the SKOS \"altLabel\" and optionally broader and narrower terms if you want a hierarchical taxonomy).\n* Periodically review and update the SKOS taxonomy.\n* Standardize the quote referencing method (e.g., paragraph numbers, key phrases).\n* During synthesis, restrict the LLM to propose allowed values only from evidence seen across multiple JSON records.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k881zy/creating_a_taxonomy_from_unstructured_content_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein accuser, dies by suicide", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql67qk0dd3o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Telnyx SMS web app", "summary": "I put together a very basic web app for sending and receiving SMS via Telnyx Messaging API.\n\nIt's very basic for now, but does send and receive (via webhooks).
