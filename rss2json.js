If found guilty, he faces a minimum of eight years in prison, ranging up to a possible life sentence.\n\nWiktor Z. is accused of collecting and transmitting information about military and other strategic sites around the northern Polish city of Bydgoszcz.\n\nAmong the targets of his alleged spying, which took place between February 2024 and April 2025, were Bydgoszcz\u2019s civilian airport, a military aviation facility, a chemical plant, and NATO\u2019s Joint Forces Training Centre in Bydgoszcz (pictured above).\n\nInvestigators say that he used instant messaging services to pass on information to Russia about the operation of the facilities, including their locations and security measures.\n\nThe man was detained by officers of Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency (ABW) in June 2025 and has remained in pretrial detention since. In a statement issued last year when he was charged, prosecutors said that he had \u201cacted out of ideological motives and pro-Russian beliefs\u201d.\n\nIn recent years, Poland has detained, charged and in some cases convicted a growing number of individuals and groups found to have been carrying out espionage, sabotage and other so-called \u201chybrid activities\u201d on behalf of Russia.\n\nAmong the most serious incidents have been\u00a0[arson attacks]( including one that\u00a0[destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest shopping centre]( and\u00a0[sabotage of a rail line](\n\nIn response, Poland has successively\u00a0[closed down all of Russia\u2019s consulates](\u00a0in Poland, prompting\u00a0[Moscow to do the same with Polish consulates](\u00a0in a tit-for-tat move.\n\nIn a separate incident this week, a 25-year-old Moldovan citizen was detained in eastern Poland after allegedly activating the handbrake on freight wagons of a train travelling on a line between the Polish city of Szczecin and the Ukrainian border.\n\nPolice are investigating the circumstances of the incident and have not described it as sabotage, but noted the potentially serious consequences, particularly as the train was carrying oil tankers, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nThey believe that the man had entered Poland from Ukraine the day before the incident.

However, in 2023, Poland 2050 joined a new coalition government led by KO and its leader, Donald Tusk.\n\nThe party\u2019s caucus in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, up until now contained 31 MPs. However, 15 of them, as well as three Poland 2050 members of the upper-house Senate, have now announced a breakaway. They are forming a new group called Centre (Centrum).\n\nThe leading figure in the new faction is Paulina Hennig-Kloska, who serves as climate and environment minister in Tusk\u2019s government. She recently finished runner-up to Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz, who is the minister of funds and regional policy, in the contest to replace Ho\u0142ownia as leader, after he\u00a0[decided to step down](\n\nToday\u2019s announcement follows weeks of turmoil within the party, which has in recent months been polling at around 2-3%, well below the threshold of 5% needed in elections to enter parliament.\n\nLast month, the second round of Poland 2050\u2019s leadership election was\u00a0[cancelled](\u00a0after it had already taken place amid claims of \u201coutside interference\u201d in the online voting system. Even after it was run again, with Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz winning, discontent remained with the party.\n\nOn Monday, one of Poland 2050\u2019s founders, Micha\u0142 Kobosko, who is a member of the European Parliament, announced that he was quitting due to \u201can\u00a0attempt to introduce a dictatorship within the party\u201d.\n\nHis resignation was then followed by that of Anna Radwan, a deputy foreign minister, who said that she \u201cdoes not feel comfortable in a place where substantive political debate has been replaced by undemocratic and non-transparent decisions\u201d.\n\nThat was echoed today by Hennig-Kloska, who said that \u201chaving the \\[party\\] leader decide on the fate of the parliamentary caucus alone is not a style we can accept\u201d\n\nHowever, she called for \u201ccontinued good cooperation\u201d with Poland 2050 and declared \u201ccontinued loyalty\u201d to Tusk\u2019s coalition, reports news website Wirtualna Polska.\n\nIn response, Poland 2050 said in a post on social media that the MPs who have decided to leave the party \u201ccould not come to terms with the democratic decision\u201d of party members who elected Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz as leader.\n\nHo\u0142ownia himself echoed that sentiment, saying that Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz is the \u201cdemocratically elected leader and we have to respect that\u201d. He accused Hennig-Kloska of \u201cdestroying\u201d the party and \u201cdestabilising the coalition\u201d.\n\nHowever, in response to today\u2019s news, Tusk said that there was no threat to the stability of his coalition\u2019s parliamentary majority.\n\n\u201cIn recent days and hours, both Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz and Hennig-Kloska assured me that they will remain loyal to the government,\u201d said the prime minister, quoted by news website Interia.\n\nThe ruling coalition has a majority of 240 MPs in the 460-seat Sejm. Most of those, 156, are from Tusk\u2019s KO, with a further 32 from the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), 21 from The Left (Lewica), and 31 from the now-splitting Poland 2050 caucus.\n\nPoland 2050 and PSL were previously themselves part of an alliance called Third Way (Trzecia Droga), which stood jointly at the 2023 elections. However, last year the two parties\u00a0[confirmed that they were ending the alliance](\u00a0and would stand separately at the next elections, scheduled for autumn 2027.\n\n[**Olivier Sorgho**](\n\nOlivier Sorgho is senior editor at Notes from Poland, covering politics, business and society.
