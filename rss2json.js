{"title": "Polish politicians clash over rapid EU membership for Ukraine", "summary": "The Polish speaker of parliament\u2019s announcement in Kyiv this week that Poland would help Ukraine join the European Union \u201cas soon as possible\u201d has prompted a backlash back at home, including from some allies within the ruling coalition as well as the president\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nMeanwhile, a newly published poll indicates that, although a large majority of Poles favour Ukraine joining the EU, most do not want an accelerated process.\n\nThis week, W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of Poland\u2019s parliament, visited Kyiv to mark the fourth anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFollowing a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday, Czarzasty\u2019s office announced that the Polish speaker had \u201cassured \\[Zelensky\\] that Poland will do everything possible to ensure that Ukraine becomes part of the EU as soon as possible\u201d.\n\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s security will be strengthened when it joins the EU,\u201d said Czarzasty, noting that this would in turn bolster Poland\u2019s security. \u201cAnd that is why Poland will assist in the integration process.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that the Sejm has signed an agreement with the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine\u2019s parliament, \u201caimed at accelerating EU membership negotiations\u201d. Poland \u201cknows how to align national law with EU law and how to effectively utilise EU funds, and we can share this knowledge\u201d, said Czarzasty.\n\nCzarzasty is one of the leaders of The Left (Lewica), a junior partner in Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, which is dominated by Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist Civic Coalition (KO) party.\n\nAfter Czarzasty\u2019s comments, figures from another coalition partner, the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), which enjoys uneasy relations with The Left, poured cold water on the speaker\u2019s suggestion that Poland would help Ukraine enter the EU as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cIf Ukraine, in line with speaker Czarzasty\u2019s announcement, were to join the EU, it would spell the death of Polish agriculture,\u201d tweeted Piotr Zgorzelski, a senior PSL figure and a deputy speaker of the Sejm.\n\nMuch of PSL\u2019s support comes from rural communities, where many are concerned by the impact that Ukraine\u2019s entry to the EU could have on Polish agriculture.\n\nMeanwhile, PSL\u2019s leader, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, who serves as deputy prime minister and defence minister, warned that Ukraine must meet the EU\u2019s anti-corruption and rule-of-law requirements before being allowed to join.\n\nHe also spoke of the need to \u201cprotect the Polish and European markets\u201d, in particular when it comes to agriculture, through a \u201ctransition period\u201d when Ukraine joins, reports the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily. But Kosiniak-Kamysz said he believes that Ukraine\u2019s membership of the EU is \u201cin Poland\u2019s interest\u201d.\n\nHe added that Ukraine must also \u201ccome to terms with history, commemorate the Polish victims in Volhynia\u201d, before it is allowed to join. That is a reference to\u00a0[massacres of ethnic Poles by Ukrainian nationalists](\u00a0during World War Two, an issue that\u00a0[continues to cause tension](\n\nPoland regards the massacres as a genocide; Ukraine rejects that label and still venerates some figures seen as responsible for the atrocities. Kosiniak-Kamysz previously\u00a0[warned]( in 2024, that Poland would not allow Ukraine to join the EU until the issue is resolved.\n\nCzarzasty\u2019s remarks in Kyiv received an even stronger rebuke from the chief of staff of President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition and last year\u00a0[said that he was currently opposed to Ukraine joining](\u00a0both the EU and NATO.\n\n\u201cCzarzasty must have confused his functions,\u201d Zbigniew Bogucki told Polsat News, suggesting that the speaker had no right to make such pronouncements on behalf of Poland. \u201cSuch statements jeopardise the reputation of the Polish state.\u201d\n\nThe far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), an opposition group, also criticised Czarzasty\u2019s remarks. One of its leaders, Slawomir Mentzen, warned that, \u201cif Ukraine joins the EU, Poland will be the biggest loser\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstead of going to Poland, money from Brussels will go to the much poorer Ukraine, where local oligarchs will steal it,\u201d said Mentzen. \u201cWe will be exposed to competition from Ukrainian agriculture, from Ukrainian transport companies, and smuggling. All criminals will be able to come to Poland without any problems.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, who hails from Tusk\u2019s KO party, said that \u201cUkraine has earned candidate status through its courage\u201d but emphasised that Kyiv \u201cmust of course meet all conditions\u201d required to join the EU, reported news website Onet.\n\nGovernment spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka likewise told Polskie Radio that Poland\u00a0[supports Ukraine\u2019s accession]( but warned that it will be \u201ca difficult, very arduous, very long process\u2026of Ukraine adapting, reforming, and changing to these European standards\u201d.\n\nYesterday, during a visit of EU leaders to Kyiv, Zelensky reiterated that Ukraine \u201cwants a fast track for membership\u201d of the bloc, though European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasised that, for Brussels, setting specific timeframes is not possible, reports Euractiv.\n\nMeanwhile, a new poll by Polish state research agency CBOS for the\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Polska*\u00a0daily published on Monday shows that a majority of Poles support Ukraine\u2019s EU membership, though not through an accelerated process.\n\nOverall, 69% favour Ukraine joining the bloc. However, only 12% say that this should happen \u201cas soon as possible, even without \\[Ukraine\\] fulfilling all the accession criteria\u201d, while 57% say it should only happen \u201cno earlier than a few years from now\u201d once Ukraine \u201cmeets all the conditions\u201d.\n\nAround one in five Poles (21%) believe that Ukraine should not join the EU at all. That figure rises to 47% among farmers.\n\nHowever, a separate poll by the IBRiS agency last year\u00a0[found](\u00a0that only 35% of Poles believed that Poland should support Ukraine\u2019s access to the EU, while 42% were opposed.\n\n[**Daniel Tilles**](\n\nDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0*Notes from Poland*.

However, that always seemed an unlikely prospect in practice, given that he was back in Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Warsaw\u2019s district court, judge Anna Ptaszek, announced that, at the request of prosecutors, they had suspended proceedings against Rubtsov until he is located. She noted that there was no evidence he had been served with a summons.\n\n\u201cHe is accused of committing a crime that has the status of a felony,\u201d noted Ptaszek, quoted by Polsat News.\n\n\u201cAccording to the regulations, individuals facing this charge must be present at least at the first hearing date, when the indictment is read and when the court asks whether the accused admits to the offence and whether they wish to provide a statement.\u201d\n\nPtaszek also revealed that prosecutors have requested that a court issue permission for the suspect to be brought into pretrial detention. That is a formal step required in order to issue domestic and European arrest warrants for Rubtsov, as well as an Interpol Red Notice.\n\nLast year, Rubtsov wrote, under the name Gonz\u00e1lez, an article for Basque news website [Naiz.info]( claiming that he had been the victim of \u201cpersecution\u201d in Poland, which had targeted him in order to silence a \u201ccritical voice\u201d.\n\nHe said that Russia had \u201crescued\u201d him from the mistreatment he was facing in Polish detention, and he shared images of his life now in Moscow.\n\nRubtsov also continues to be active on social media platform X. Last November, after he failed to appear at a scheduled court hearing in Warsaw, he wrote a post saying that he \u201chad no idea\u201d it was taking place as \u201cthey didn\u2019t communicate it to me\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the political pressure, the case would already be suspended, closed, or whatever,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Polish media reports, Rubtsov\u2019s former partner, a Polish journalist who is named only as Magdalena Ch. under Polish privacy law, has also been charged with aiding and abetting his espionage. However, she had so far not been brought to trial and continues to work as a journalist.\n\nIn 2022, Poland\u00a0[expelled 45 Russian diplomats](\u00a0who it said were actually spies. Since then, it has\u00a0[closed all three Russian consulates](\u00a0operating in Poland in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s\u00a0[campaign of sabotage](\u00a0and other so-called \u201chybrid actions\u201d.\n\n[**Daniel Tilles**](\n\nDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0*Notes from Poland*.
