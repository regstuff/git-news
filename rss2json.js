We\u2019ve grown, we\u2019ve learned, and the landscape of open source (especially at any meaningful scale) is as challenging and rewarding as ever. As always, we want to remain transparent, engage directly, and make sure our community feels heard.\n\nBelow is a reflection on open source realities, sustainability, and why we\u2019ve made the choices we have regarding maintenance, licensing, and ongoing work. (It\u2019s a bit long, but I hope you\u2019ll find it insightful\u2014even if you don\u2019t agree with everything!)\n\n\\---\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how often discussions about open source and sustainable projects get derailed by narratives that seem to ignore even the most basic economic realities. Before getting into the details, I want to emphasize that what follows isn\u2019t a definitive guide or universally \u201cright\u201d answer, it\u2019s a reflection of my own experiences, observations, and the lessons my team and I have picked up along the way. The world of open source, especially at any meaningful scale, doesn\u2019t come with a manual, and we\u2019re continually learning, adapting, and trying to do what\u2019s best for the project and its community. Others may have faced different challenges, or found approaches that work better for them, and that diversity of perspective is part of what makes this ecosystem so interesting. My hope is simply that by sharing our own thought process and the realities we\u2019ve encountered, it might help add a bit of context or clarity for anyone thinking about similar issues.\n\nFor those not deeply familiar with OSS project maintenance: open source is neither magic nor self-perpetuating. Code doesn\u2019t write itself, servers don\u2019t pay their own bills, and improvements don\u2019t happen merely through the power of communal critique. There is a certain romance in the idea of everything being open, free, and effortless, but reality is rarely so generous. A recurring misconception deserving urgent correction concerns how a serious project is actually operated and maintained at scale, especially in the world of \u201cfree\u201d software. Transparency doesn\u2019t consist of a swelling graveyard of Issues that no single developer or even a small team will take years or decades to resolve. If anything, true transparency and responsibility mean managing these tasks and conversations in a scalable, productive way. Converting Issues into Discussions, particularly using built-in platform features designed for this purpose, is a normal part of scaling open source process as communities grow. The role of Issues in a repository is to track actionable, prioritized items that the team can reasonably address in the near term. Overwhelming that system with hundreds or thousands of duplicate bug reports, wish-list items, requests from people who have made no attempt to follow guidelines, or details on non-reproducible incidents ultimately paralyzes any forward movement. It takes very little experience in actual large-scale collaboration to grasp that a streamlined, focused Issues board is vital, not villainous. The rest flows into discussions, exactly as platforms like GitHub intended. Suggesting that triaging and categorizing for efficiency, moving unreproducible bugs or priorities to the correct channels, shelving duplicates or off-topic requests, reflects some sinister lack of transparency is deeply out of touch with both the scale of contribution and the human bandwidth available.\n\nLet\u2019s talk the myth that open source can run entirely on the noble intentions of volunteers or the inertia of the internet. For an uncomfortably long stretch of this project\u2019s life, there was exactly one engineer, Tim, working unpaid, endlessly and often at personal financial loss, tirelessly keeping the lights on and code improving, pouring in not only nights and weekends but literal cash to keep servers online. Those server bills don\u2019t magically zero out at midnight because a project is \u201copen\u201d or \u201cbeloved.\u201d Reality is often starker: you are left sacrificing sleep, health, and financial security for the sake of a community that, in its loudest quarters, sometimes acts as if your obligation is infinite, unquestioned, and invisible. It's worth emphasizing: there were months upon months with literally a negative income stream, no outside sponsorships, and not a cent of personal profit. Even in a world where this is somehow acceptable for the owner, but what kind of dystopian logic dictates that future team members, hypothetically with families, sick children to care for, rent and healthcare and grocery bills, are expected to step into unpaid, possibly financially draining roles simply because a certain vocal segment expects everything built for them, with no thanks given except more demands? If the expectation is that contribution equals servitude, years of volunteering plus the privilege of community scorn, perhaps a rethink of fundamental fairness is in order.\n\nThe essential point missed in these critiques is that scaling a project to properly fix bugs, add features, and maintain a high standard of quality requires human talent. Human talent, at least in the world we live in, expects fair and humane compensation. You cannot tempt world-class engineers and maintainers with shares of imagined community gratitude. Salaries are not paid in GitHub upvotes, nor will critique, however artful, ever underwrite a family\u2019s food, healthcare, or education. This is the very core of why license changes are necessary and why only a very small subsection of open source maintainers are able to keep working, year after year, without burning out, moving on, or simply going broke. The license changes now in effect are precisely so that, instead of bugs sitting for months unfixed, we might finally be able to pay, and thus, retain, the people needed to address exactly the problems that now serve as touchpoint for complaint. It\u2019s a strategy motivated not by greed or covert commercialism, but by our desire to keep contributing, keep the project alive for everyone, not just for a short time but for years to come, and not leave a graveyard of abandoned issues for the next person to clean up.\n\nAny suggestion that these license changes are somehow a betrayal of open source values falls apart upon the lightest reading of their actual terms. If you take a moment to examine those changes, rather than react to rumors, you\u2019ll see they are meant to be as modest as possible. Literally: keep the branding or attribution and you remain free to use the project, at any scale you desire, whether for personal use or as the backbone of a startup with billions of users. The only ask is minimal, visible, non-intrusive attribution as a nod to the people and sacrifice behind your free foundation. If, for specific reasons, your use requires stripping that logo, the license simply expects that you either be a genuinely small actor (for whom impact is limited and support need is presumably lower), a meaningful contributor who gives back code or resources, or an organization willing to contribute to the sustainability which benefits everyone. It\u2019s not a limitation; it\u2019s common sense. The alternative, it seems, is the expectation that creators should simply give up and hand everything away, then be buried under user demands when nothing improves. Or worse, be forced to sell to a megacorp, or take on outside investment that would truly compromise independence, freedom, and the user-first direction of the project. This was a carefully considered, judiciously scoped change, designed not to extract unfair value, but to guarantee there is still value for anyone to extract a year from now.\n\nEqually, the kneejerk suspicion of commercialization fails to acknowledge the practical choices at hand. If we genuinely wished to sell out or lock down every feature, there were and are countless easier paths: flood the core interface with ads, disappear behind a subscription wall, or take venture capital and prioritize shareholder return over community need. Not only have we not taken those routes, there have been months where the very real choice was to dig into personal pockets (again, without income), all to ensure the platform would survive another week. VC money is never free, and the obligations it entails often run counter to open source values and user interests. We chose the harder, leaner, and far less lucrative road so that independence and principle remain intact. Yet instead of seeing this as the solid middle ground it is, one designed to keep the project genuinely open and moving forward, it gets cast as some betrayal by those unwilling or unable to see the math behind payroll, server upkeep, and the realities of life for working engineers. Our intention is to create a sustainable, independent project. We hope this can be recognized as an honest effort at a workable balance, even if it won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s ideal.\n\nNot everyone has experience running the practical side of open projects, and that\u2019s understandable, it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s easy to miss until you\u2019ve lived it. There is a cost to everything. The relentless effort, the discipline required to keep a project alive while supporting a global user base, and the repeated sacrifice of time, money, and peace of mind, these are all invisible in the abstract but measured acutely in real life. Our new license terms simply reflect a request for shared responsibility, a basic, almost ceremonial gesture honoring the chain of effort that lets anyone, anywhere, build on this work at zero cost, so long as they acknowledge those enabling it. If even this compromise is unacceptable, then perhaps it is worth considering what kind of world such entitlement wishes to create: one in which contributors are little more than expendable, invisible labor to be discarded at will.\n\nDespite these frustrations, I want to make eminently clear how deeply grateful we are to the overwhelming majority of our community: users who read, who listen, who contribute back, donate, and, most importantly, understand that no project can grow in a vacuum of support. Your constant encouragement, your sharp eyes, and your belief in the potential of this codebase are what motivate us to continue working, year after year, even when the numbers make no sense. It is for you that this project still runs, still improves, and still pushes forward, not just today, but into tomorrow and beyond.\n\n\u2014 Tim\n\n\\---\n\n**AMA TIME!**  \nI\u2019d love to answer any questions you might have about:\n\n* Project maintenance\n* Open source sustainability\n* Our license/model changes\n* Burnout, compensation, and project scaling\n* The future of Open WebUI\n* Or anything else related (technical or not!)\n\nSeriously, ask me anything \u2013 whether you\u2019re a developer, user, lurker, critic, or just open source curious.

Role-based prompting Assigning a specific role upfront (e.g. \u201cAct as a technical product manager\u2026\u201d) drastically improves tone and relevance.\n2. One-shot and multi-shot prompting Giving examples helps steer style and formatting, especially for writing-heavy or classification tasks.\n3. Chain-of-Thought reasoning Explicitly asking for step-by-step reasoning improves math, logic, and instruction-following.\n4. Clarify First (my go-to) Before answering, I ask the model to pose follow-up questions if anything is unclear.

We have clients who run different businesses (property management, restaurants, shops etc) and they all have hundreds of customer questions that their support teams answer daily. The challenge? How to organize these Q&amp;As automatically so they can train their chatbots better.\n\nThe Problem:\nImagine you have 300+ questions like:\n\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s the WiFi password?\u201d\n- \u201cHow do I reset the router?\u201d\n- \u201cInternet not working\u201d\n- \u201cCan\u2019t connect to WiFi\u201d\n\nThese are all basically about the same thing - internet issues. But going through hundreds of questions manually to group them? That\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nWhat I Built:\n\nA Python system that uses OpenAI\u2019s API to automatically understand and group similar questions. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. Feed it an Excel file with questions and answers\n1. It reads the content and understands the meaning (not just keywords)\n1. Groups similar Q&amp;As into main categories and sub-categories\n1. Names each group based on what\u2019s actually in them\n\nThe Cool Part:\n\nIt works for ANY business without changing the code. Same system works for:\n\n- Property management \u2192 Groups into \u201cWiFi Issues\u201d, \u201cCheck-in Problems\u201d, \u201cMaintenance\u201d\n- Restaurants \u2192 Groups into \u201cMenu Questions\u201d, \u201cReservations\u201d, \u201cDietary Restrictions\u201d\n- E-commerce \u2192 Groups into \u201cShipping\u201d, \u201cReturns\u201d, \u201cPayment Issues\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s What My Results Look Like:\n\nCLUSTERING RESULTS FOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT (322 Q&amp;As)\n\n\ud83d\udcc1 Maintenance &amp; Repair (76 Q&amp;As)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Diagnostic Inquiry (31 Q&amp;As)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Access Issues (19 Q&amp;As)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Heating Issues (6 Q&amp;As)\n\n\ud83d\udcc1 WiFi &amp; Network (31 Q&amp;As)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 WiFi Connectivity (27 Q&amp;As)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Login Problems (4 Q&amp;As)\n\n\ud83d\udcc1 Check-in &amp; Checkout (40 Q&amp;As)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Early Check-in (17 Q&amp;As)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Late Checkout (23 Q&amp;As)\n\nQuick Visualization of How It Distributes:\n\nMain Cluster Distribution:\n[====Maintenance====] 76 Q&amp;As (23.6%)\n[====Supplies=====] 69 Q&amp;As (21.4%)\n[==Checkout===] 40 Q&amp;As (12.4%)\n[==WiFi==] 31 Q&amp;As (9.6%)\n[=Others=] 106 Q&amp;As (32.9%)\n\nThe Technical Bits (for those interested):\n\n- Uses OpenAI\u2019s embedding model (text-embedding-3-small)\n- K-means clustering for grouping\n- GPT-4o-mini for generating meaningful names\n- Costs about $0.10-0.15 to process 300-400 Q&amp;As\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\n1. Chatbot training becomes super easy - just feed responses based on clusters\n1. Support teams can create better FAQ sections\n1. Identifies what customers ask about most\n1. Works for any business in any language\n\nCode Structure (simplified):\n\n1. Load Excel file\n\ndata = load_excel(\u201ccustomer_questions.xlsx\u201d)\n\n2. Create embeddings (understand meaning)\n\nembeddings = openai.embed(questions + answers)\n\n3. Group similar ones\n\nclusters = kmeans.fit(embeddings)\n\n4. Name them smartly\n\ncluster_names = gpt4.generate_names(clusters)\n\n\nChallenges I Faced:\n\n- Sub-clusters were getting weird names initially (everything was named same as main cluster)\n- Had to balance between too many clusters vs too few\n- Making sure it works for ANY business type without hardcoding\n\nResults:\n\n- Processes 300+ Q&amp;As in about 2 minutes\n- 85-90% accurate grouping (based on manual checking)\n- Saves hours of manual categorization\n\nCurrently testing this with different business types. The goal is to make it a plug-and-play solution where any business can just upload their Q&amp;A data and get organized clusters ready for chatbot training.\n\n\nFor those asking about costs - OpenAI API costs roughly:\n\n- Embeddings: ~$0.02 per 1000 Q&amp;As\n- GPT-4o-mini for naming: ~$0.10 per run\n- Total: Less than $0.15 for organizing 300-400 Q&amp;As\n\nUPDATE: We\u2019re Actually Offering This as a Service!\n\nSince many of you are asking - yes, we can help you implement this for your business! Whether you\u2019re running:\n\n- Customer support teams drowning in repetitive questions\n- E-commerce sites needing better FAQ organization\n- Any business wanting to train chatbots with organized data\n\nWe can set this up for you. Just DM me or drop a comment if you want to discuss. We\u2019ll need:\n\n1. Your Q&amp;A data in Excel/CSV format\n1. About 30 mins to understand your specific needs\n1. We\u2019ll deliver organized clusters ready for your chatbot or support team\n\nAlready helped 3 businesses organize 1000+ Q&amp;As each.

Yet many users still rely on improvised, inconsistent prompting approaches that lead to variable outcomes. The MASTER PROMPT FRAMEWORK addresses this challenge by providing a universal structure informed by the latest research in prompt engineering and LLM behavior.\n\n**A Research-Driven Approach**\n\nThe framework synthesizes findings from recent papers like \"Reasoning Models Can Be Effective Without Thinking\" (2024) and \"ReTool: Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Tool Use in LLMs\" (2024), and incorporates insights about how modern language models process information, reason through problems, and respond to different prompt structures.  \n  \n**Domain-Agnostic by Design**\n\nWhile many prompting techniques are task-specific, the MASTER PROMPT FRAMEWORK is designed to be universally adaptable to everything from creative writing to data analysis, software development to financial planning. This adaptability comes from its focus on structural elements that enhance performance across all domains, while allowing for domain-specific customization.\n\n# The 8-Section Framework\n\n**The MASTER PROMPT FRAMEWORK** consists of eight carefully designed sections that collectively optimize how LLMs interpret and respond to requests:\n\n\n\n1. **Role/Persona Definition**: Establishes expertise, capabilities, and guiding principles\n2. **Task Definition**: Clarifies objectives, goals, and success criteria\n3. **Context/Input Processing**: Provides relevant background and key considerations\n4. **Reasoning Process**: Guides the model's approach to analyzing and solving the problem\n5. **Constraints/Guardrails**: Sets boundaries and prevents common pitfalls\n6. **Output Requirements**: Specifies format, style, length, and structure\n7. **Examples**: Demonstrates expected inputs and outputs (optional)\n8. **Refinement Mechanisms**: Enables verification and iterative improvement\n\nPractical Benefits\n\nEarly adopters of the framework report several key advantages:\n\n* **Consistency**: More reliable, high-quality outputs across different tasks\n* **Efficiency**: Less time spent refining and iterating on prompts\n* **Transferability**: Templates that work across different LLM platforms\n* **Collaboration**: Shared prompt structures that teams can refine together\n\n  \n\\##To Use.

Break down complex problems into manageable sub-problems when appropriate.\n\n3. Apply domain-specific principles from {DOMAIN} alongside general reasoning methods.\n\n4. Consider multiple perspectives before forming conclusions.\n\n5. When uncertain, explicitly acknowledge limitations and ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Only resort to probability-based assumptions when clarification isn't possible.\n\n6. Validate your thinking against the established success criteria.\n\n\n\n\\## 5.
