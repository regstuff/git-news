Then, for one of my elective courses, I chose a course that combines NLP with computer vision, studying the relationship between language and vision( A cutting-edge research topic at my university).\nNow I need to choose another course, but none of the options seem particularly appealing to me:\n\n1. Formal Semantics: Propositional Logic, First-Order Logic, Lambda Calculus. In the second part of the course, Syntax and Semantics, Montague Grammar. \n\n      -I know it\u2019s a bit outdated\n\n\n2. Neurolinguistics ( neurobiological foundations of language ): I would choose this mostly for personal interest (I have a background in linguistics).\n\nI  thought it could potentially give me useful knowledge for research, perhaps understanding neurolinguistics well could help improve the language of AI systems (??) or working in NLP applications for clinic applications ( Aphasia, language disorders..) \n\n3. Language Modeling and Cognition: A theoretical course based on studying papers that analyze the capabilities of LLMs. So, you don\u2019t study how to create LLMs, but instead, you read papers on their reasoning abilities, cognitive capabilities, etcc \n\nI know that LLMs are the current standard in NLP, they are very important, but I\u2019m not sure how useful such a theoretical exam really is.\"\n\n\n4. Computational Linguistics and Language-Based Interaction: \nAn NLP course for beginners, covering topics such as linguistic datasets, distributional semantics and vector spaces, neural networks, attention, transformers, machine translation, language models (large language models), and generative models.   \n\nI really liked the idea of this course, but since it is from a different department and is also designed for beginners (like my NLP course), these are topics that I will cover in other courses, both in NLP and in the two ML exams I will take. the only new topics would be machine translation, LLM and maybe trasformers", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fh9s9g/help_me_choose_an_elective_in_nlp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Turn your Raspberry Pi into a low-latency home security camera!", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/TzuHuanTai/RaspberryPi_WebRTC", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India Sends Relief Supplies To Typhoon-Hit Myanmar, Laos And Vietnam", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-sends-relief-supplies-to-typhoon-hit-myanmar-laos-and-vietnam-6571973", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China directs its carmakers not to make auto-related investments in India", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.moneycontrol.com/automobile/china-directs-its-carmakers-not-to-make-auto-related-investments-in-india-article-12820062.html/amp?classic=true", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Demographic decline: Greece faces alarming population collapse", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/13/demographic-decline-greece-faces-alarming-population-collapse", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Houthi missile reaches central Israel for first time, no injuries reported", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/missile-fired-yemen-set-off-sirens-central-israel-military-says-2024-09-15/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thai cave boys\u2019 coach trapped again six years later by typhoon floods", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/11/thai-cave-boys-coach-trapped-again-six-years-later-by-typhoon-floods", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why so many French teachers are calling it quits", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240914-why-french-teachers-walking-away-from-jobs-education-france", "author": "None"}, {"title": "North Korean missiles rain down on Ukraine despite sanctions", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/09/12/world/north-korea-missiles-ukraine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mahsa Amini's Family 'Surrounded,' Ordered To Stay Home On Anniversary Of Iranian Student's Death In Custody", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-amini-anniversary-clampdown-rights/33120707.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More than 80% of EU marine protected areas are ineffective, study shows", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/13/more-than-80-of-eu-marine-protected-areas-are-ineffective-study-shows", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Aid not reaching Gaza, say relief groups as \u2018more than a million go without food\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/gaza-aid-food-medical-supplies-backlog", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
