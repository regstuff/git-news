It has also caused tension within Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition, as the reform was strongly supported by The Left (Lewica).\n\nOn Tuesday, Tusk announced the suspension of work on the legislation, which would have given PIP inspectors the power to reclassify business-to-business (B2B) contracts or so-called \u201cjunk contracts\u201d (*umowy \u015bmieciowe*)\u00a0*as*\u00a0employment contracts (*umowy o prac\u0119*) in cases where a worker is effectively treated as an employee, despite being formally hired as a contractor.\n\nEmployment contracts come with stronger rights and benefits for workers, as well as more obligations for employers, than B2B contracts or junk contracts, a type of agreement that does not provide employment protection, wage protection and the right to holidays.\n\nThe planned reforms had been welcomed by PIP itself as well as trade unions. But they sparked anger among employers, particularly over a proposal that would have required businesses to pay up to three years of backdated employee social security contributions if a contractor was reclassified as an employee.\n\nJustifying his decision to suspend work on the reform, Tusk said that granting \u201cexcessive power for officials who will decide how people are employed would be very destructive for many companies and could also mean job losses for many people\u201d.\n\nPolish law defines employment as work performed under the supervision of a manager, at a place and time designated by the employer. Replacing an employment relationship with a B2B contract is unlawful.\n\nHowever, B2B contracts have nevertheless become a popular way for businesses to avoid employment contracts and cut labour costs.\n\nMoreover, people with sole-proprietorship (*jednoosobowa dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcza*) status benefit from preferential health insurance contributions for new businesses and can deduct some taxes, allowing workers to keep more income.\n\nThis form of work, however, also brings greater job insecurity, as it falls outside labour law protections, and often results in lower pensions due to reduced contributions. It also reduces income tax revenues and health insurance contributions to the state, at a time when Poland is facing\u00a0[rapidly rising debt](\n\nWork on the PIP reform followed an agreement with the European Commission reached at the beginning of last year, after Poland[\u00a0abandoned](\u00a0plans to introduce social security contributions for \u201cjunk contracts\u201d that had been agreed with the EU under the former government.\n\nThe proposed PIP reform went beyond expanding inspectors\u2019 powers. It also included provisions for data exchange between the state Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), PIP and National Revenue Administration (KAS), streamlining inspections through remote controls and electronic documentation, and introducing new fines for violations of workers\u2019 rights.\n\nIn early December 2025, the standing committee of the Council of Ministers, a key inter-ministerial body, approved a draft PIP reform bill prepared by the family, labour and social policy ministry.\n\nAlthough the full draft bill was not made public,\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0reported that inspectors could decide whether a worker had been an employee up to three years in the past, which could force businesses to retrospectively pay social security contributions and taxes.\n\nTusk\u2019s decision now to abandon the plans has prompted concern from his coalition partners over both the protection of workers and the fact that Poland could lose EU funds.\n\nW\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, one of the leaders of The Left and the speaker of the Sejm, the lower house of parliament, said that, if the necessary reforms are not implemented, Poland could lose 11 billion zloty (\u20ac2.6 billion), reports the Interia news website. He announced that he would be meeting with Tusk this week to discuss the matter.\n\nThe minister for funds and regional policy, Katarzyna Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz of the centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050), likewise warned of \u201cmulti-billion costs\u201d.\n\nShe told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that Poland may try to revise its agreement with the EU, but that this would be difficult given that funds have to be allocated this year.\n\nMeanwhile, labour minister Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-B\u0105k, also from The Left, expressed her willingness to work on a new solution.\n\n\u201cIf there is an expectation to discuss other tools, we are ready for such a discussion. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but the goal remains the same, because we want to protect Polish workers,\u201d she said.\n\nTusk\u2019s decision was criticised by Piotr Ostrowski, chairman of All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), who told broadcaster TVN that it appears \u201cthe prime minister doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about\u201d. He suggested that Tusk was effectively \u201callowing noncompliance\u201d with existing labour law.\n\nHowever, Marek Kowalski, head of the Federation of Polish Entrepreneurs (FPP), welcomed the fact that the prime minister had \u201clistened to the voice of business owners\u201d.\n\nHe argued that labour inspectors lack the expertise to determine employment status and warned that the reform could raise costs for businesses, ultimately harming workers themselves.\n\nBut the head of PIP, Marcin Stanecki, defended the proposed reforms, saying that they would be \u201cvery beneficial for both business owners and the National Labour Inspectorate\u201d, reports PAP.

That phase is often used by Braun and his supporters to suggest that Jews are seeking to control Poland.\n\nAnother deleted video encouraged people to financially support Janusz Walu\u015b, a Polish white nationalist who assassinated anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani in South Africa in 1993 with the aim of inciting a race war.\n\nWalu\u015b was\u00a0[recently released from prison](\u00a0in South Africa and returned to Poland, where he arrived at the airport accompanied by Braun.\n\nFinally, a video documenting Braun and his supporters\u00a0[tearing down a Ukrainian flag](\u00a0displayed on a Polish town hall as a sign of solidarity was also deleted by TikTok.\n\nThe content was removed after being reported by the Never Again Association, a Polish NGO that campaigns against racism, antisemitism and xenophobia. The association works with a number of social media platforms to help root out hateful content.\n\n\u201cTikTok approached us to be its social partner regarding content that may violate its terms and conditions and criminal provisions, including hate speech,\u201d the association\u2019s Rafa\u0142 Pankowski told\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*. \u201cWe merely report the content for review. The platform makes the decision to remove it.\u201d\n\nThe six deleted videos are just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d, Pankowski added in comments to Reuters. \u201cThere is simply a whole lot of such material\u2026I think that the worst thing in all this is that there is this element of glorification, incitement to violence.\u201d\n\nFar-right groups have been very successful on TikTok. S\u0142awomir Mentzen, a former ally of Braun, is the most popular Polish politician on the platform, with 1.6 million followers. That has helped him reach young voters, among whom[\u00a0far-right groups are especially popular](\n\nIn 2022,\u00a0[Facebook banned Confederation](\u00a0(Konfederacja), the far-right group that Mentzen leads (and to which Braun previously belonged), from its platform for \u201crepeated violations\u201d of its rules against hate speed and COVID-19 disinformation. However, it\u00a0[lifted the ban](\u00a0the following year.\n\nIn 2024, YouTube removed 11 of Braun\u2019s videos following reports by the Never Again Association that he was promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial and calls for violence against LGBT+ people.\n\nBraun rose to greater prominence last year on the back of a presidential campaign centred around\u00a0[antisemitic](\u00a0[anti-Ukrainian](\u00a0and\u00a0[anti-LGBT](\u00a0rhetoric. He finished a surprise\u00a0[fourth in the election]( with 6.3% of the vote, and his party is now averaging\u00a0[around 8% support in the polls](\n\nIn December, he\u00a0[went on trial](\u00a0for a range of offences, including his 2023 attack on the Hanukkah celebration in parliament. He is also facing further charges for other alleged crimes, including denying Nazi crimes and\u00a0[vandalising](\u00a0an LGBT+ exhibition.\n\nLast week, Poland\u2019s government\u00a0[called on the European Union](\u00a0to take action against TikTok over a series of AI-generated videos showing young women calling for Poland to leave the EU (a position Braun has also promoted).
