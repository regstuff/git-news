Whoever tells you that they got this library, tools, or agent that can help you achieve your goal without prompting; they are lying to you or bullshit themselves.\n\nAt the heart of the LLM is prompting; LLM is just like any piece of appliance in your house. It will not function without instructions from you ,and prompting is the instruction you give to the LLM to \u201cfunction\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, there are many theories and concepts of prompting that you can find on the internet. And I read a lot of them, but I found they are very shallow. I have a background in programming, machine learning, and training LLMs (small ones). I have read most of the major academic papers about the advent of LLMs since the original ChatGPT paper. And, I use LLM for most of my coding now. While I am not the top-tier AI scientist Facebook is trying to pay 100 million to, I would consider myself a professional level when it comes to prompting. Recently, I had an epiphany on prompting when I created a podcast about AI talking about the NBA.\n\n[ \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI boiled prompting into 4 pieces of input: personas, context, instructions, and negative instructions. If you don\u2019t give these 4 pieces of input, the LLM will choose or use the default one for you.\n\nPersonas are personalities that you give the LLM to role-play. If you don\u2019t give it one, then it will default to the helper one that we all know.\n\n\u00a0\n\nContext is the extra information you give your LLM that is not persona, instructions, or negative instructions. An example of this could you a PDF, an image, a finance report, or any other relevant data that the LLM needs to do its job. Now, if you don\u2019t give it one, then it will default to being empty, or in most cases, it will remember stuff about you. I think all chat engine now remembers stuff about their users. If it is your first time chatting with the LLM, then the context is all the things it had been trained on, and anything goes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions are the ones everyone knows and are usually what all of us type in when we use chatbots. The only thing I want to say about this is that you need to be very precise in explaining what you want. The better your explanation, the better the response. It helps to know the domain of your questions. For example, if you want the LLM to write a story for you, then if you list things like themes, plot, characters, settings, and other literary elements, then the LLM will give you a better response than if you just ask \u2013 write me a story about Bob.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNegative instructions are the hidden aspect of prompting that I don\u2019t hear enough about. I read a lot of information about prompting, and it seems like it is not even a thing. Well, let me tell you how important it is. So, negative instructions are instructions you tell the LLM not to do. I think it is as important to tell it what to do. For example, if you want the LLM to write a story, you could include all the things that the story doesn\u2019t have. Now, are there more things in this world that are things in your story? And you can really go to town here. Same thing as regular instructions, the more precise the better. You can even list all the words you don\u2019t want the LLM to use (quick aside, people who train LLMs use this to filter out bad or curse words).\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for reading, and please let me know what you think.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTLDR: personas, context, instructions, and negative instructions are the most important things from prompting.\n\n\u00a0", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lnc07b/i_use_ai_to_create_a_podcast_where_ai_talks_about/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sequential Workflow Designer - visual flow designer, flowchart editor", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/nocode-js/sequential-workflow-designer", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Men are opening up about mental health to AI instead of humans", "summary": "", "link": "https://aiindexes.com/men-mental-health-ai/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why William Minor, One of the Most Important Contributors to the Oxford English Dictionary, Cut Off His Own Penis", "summary": "[", "link": "https://historianandrew.medium.com/why-one-of-the-most-important-contributors-to-the-oxford-english-dictionary-cut-off-his-own-penis-c204e70d08df?sk=fd83b187536f64fc47fc4d1d5f0eb719", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Possible sabotage\u2019 under investigation in Air India plane crash: Report", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/possible-sabotage-under-investigation-in-air-india-plane-crash-report-101751176360790.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Getting into fieldwork", "summary": "I\u2019m an Archaeology undergrad student in York and I\u2019m at a bit of a loss in regards to finding digs to be a part of.
