The context of his message was not made clear, but it may have been a reference to Trump\u2019s threat to place tariffs on Germany in relation to the Greenland crisis.\n\nGottschalk then wrote: \u201c\u20ac1.3 billion should suffice as a reparations payment for the complicity in the Nord Stream bombing. My first official act as finance minister will be to assert these claims against Poland. He who laughs last, laughs best.\u201d\n\nAfD has no immediate prospect of coming to power, with elections not due until 2029. But it is the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s parliament, and, according to polling averages, is also currently the most popular party among voters, with support of around 26%.\n\nGottschalk\u2019s reference to Nord Stream concerns the 2022 operation that saw explosives used to damage pipelines in the Baltic Sea that brought Russian gas to Germany, rendering them inoperable (though they were not functioning at that moment in any case, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine).\n\nPoland had long\u00a0[criticised Germany over the pipelines]( arguing that they helped fund Russia\u2019s war machine and harmed Polish and Ukrainian interests. Many in Poland welcomed the sabotage that damaged Nord Stream. However, there is no evidence that Poland itself was complicit.\n\nLast year, at Germany\u2019s request, the Polish authorities detained a Ukrainian man, Volodymyr Zhuravlov, accused by German prosecutors of involvement in the sabotage operation. But a Polish court\u00a0[rejected a request to extradite](\u00a0him, a decision\u00a0[praised by figures](\u00a0in both Poland\u2019s government and opposition.\n\nSome in Germany condemned Poland for its support of Zhuravlov and refusal to extradite him. Such criticism came in particular from the AfD, which has long been accused of having sympathies towards and connections with Russia.\n\nGottschalk himself at the time accused the Polish state of \u201cbeing an accomplice to terrorists\u201d. AfD\u2019s co-leader Tino Chrupalla\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that Poland was as great a threat to Germany as Russia and, as an example, pointed to the decision \u201cnot to extradite a terrorist to Germany\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Gottschalk\u2019s use of the term \u201creparations\u201d and his demand for \u20ac1.3 billion in his tweet this week was likely a reference to another area of tension between Poland and Germany.\n\nIn 2021, Poland\u2019s former PiS government\u00a0[presented a demand to Germany](\u00a0for of $1.3 trillion in reparations for World War Two. That claim\u00a0[continues to be pursued](\u00a0by PiS-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, and is\u00a0[supported by most Poles]( However, Germany argues that the case is\u00a0[legally closed](\u00a0already.\n\nGottschalk\u2019s latest remarks prompted anger in Poland. Speaking to broadcaster Polsat, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-B\u0105k, the labour minister and a member of The Left (Lewica), called them \u201cabsolutely outrageous words\u201d.\n\nThey were also criticised by Krzysztof Bosak, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), some of whose MEPs are\u00a0[part of the same group in the European Parliament](\u00a0as AfD.\n\n\u201cThe Germans claimed \\[Nord Stream\\] was a business project, not a political one. If \\[so\\], then it should have been insured, instead of complaining now and fantasising about compensation (because that\u2019s probably what they were after, not reparations),\u201d wrote Bosak.\n\nIn November last year, a local AfD activist, Fabian Keubel, also prompted widespread anger in Poland by calling Poles \u201cthe African Americans of Europe\u201d because they \u201csee themselves as the great, pitiable, perennial victim of European history\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/23/senior-afd-figure-demands-poland-pay-germany-reparations-for-nord-stream-sabotage/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK plans to create 'British FBI' to bring national investigations under single police force", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/britain-police-terrorism-fraud-gangs-1feb74571e874e12514d8b9f4b59fc98", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Maternity hospital struck as two largest Ukrainian cities come under attack, officials say", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russian-planners-face-dilemma-putins-defence-minister-sensitive-over-wagner-boss-comparison-12541713?postid=5588495&amp;gsid=f0c36815-3039-4ee1-beda-bed582cf5649", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30,000: Local Officials", "summary": "", "link": "https://time.com/nextgen-preview/7228edd7c55f97e885492382190da5ed793b2bc4232f62e28dc1fe33fca070ed/article/7357635/?utm_source=reddit.com", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Former PM Lee Hae-chan dies during Vietnam trip", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/southkorea/politics/20260125/former-pm-lee-hae-chan-dies-during-vietnam-trip", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Naval blockade being considered in order to halt Cuban oil imports", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-administration-weighs-naval-blockade-halt-cuban-oil-imports-politico-2026-01-23/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland to send hundreds of generators to Ukraine amid winter heating crisis", "summary": "The Polish government is sending 379 power generators from its strategic reserves to Ukraine, where Russian attacks have left many without heat and power amid freezing winter temperatures.\n\nMeanwhile, the city of Warsaw is sending an additional 90 generators of its own to help protect Ukrainians from the winter freeze.
