When we uploaded 70K small pdfs (1-3 pages each)  \nwe noticed that the UI got horrible slow, like waiting 25 sec. to select a collection in the chat.  \nOur infrasctrucute is very fast, every thing is performing snappy.   \nWe have PG as a OWUI DB instead of SQLite  \nAnd we use PGvector as a Vector DB. \n\nI begin to investigate:   \n(See details in the Github issue: \n\n* Check the PGVector DB, maybe the retrieval is slow: \n   * That is not the case for these 70K rows, i got a cousing simularity response of under 1sec.\n* Check the PG-DB from OWUI\n   * I evaluated the running requests on the DB and saw that if you open the Knowledge overview, it is basically selecting all uploaded files, instead of only querying against the Knowledge Table.\n* Then i checked the Knowledge Table in the OWUI-DB\n   * Found the column \"Data\" that stores all related file.ids.\n\nI worked on some DBs in the past, but not really with PG, but it seems to me like an very ineffiecient way of storing relations in DBs.  \nI guess the common practice is to have an relationship-table like:  \nknowledge &lt;-&gt; kb\\_files &lt;-&gt; files\n\nIn my opinion OWUI could be drastically enhanced for larger Collections if some Changes would be implemented.  \nI am not a programmer at all, i like to explre DBs, but i am also no DB expert, but what do you think, are my assumptions correct, or is that how keep data in PG? Pls correct me if i am wrong :) \n\nThank you :) have a good day", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1nzmovd/issue_with_performance_on_large_knowledge/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Renewables overtake coal as world's biggest source of electricity", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2rz08en2po", "author": "None"}, {"title": "General strike against 13-hour work day brings Greece to a halt", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/01/general-strike-against-13-hour-day-brings-greece-to-a-halt", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Snow leopard population in Himachal rises 62% in 4 years, hits record 83 count - CNBC TV18", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/india/snow-leopard-population-in-himachal-rises-62-in-4-years-hits-record-83-count-19701504.htm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Renewables overtake coal as world's biggest source of electricity", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2rz08en2po?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAadTiUKEZXMNosZsbJDr8ytlXKdTCwlpgsGYLlvV6aCCcn367NH1Z9aPyODmRg_aem_mcUEBCIMlxwndjUgHhD4Bg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland hands over 16-year-old alleged agent to Ukraine", "summary": "Poland has detained and handed over to Ukraine a 16-year-old Ukrainian who is accused of acting as a Russian agent, helping recruit other young Ukrainians to carry out terrorist attacks.\n\nOn Monday morning, Ukraine\u2019s internal security agency, the SBU, announced that the teenager \u2013 who comes from the eastern city of Kharkiv and moved to the European Union in 2024 \u2013 had been handed over by the Polish authorities at the border.\n\n\n\nAccording to the SBU, the boy was recruited through the Telegram messaging platform by the Russian security services to help find fellow youngsters who would carry out attacks in Ukraine itself in return for payment.
