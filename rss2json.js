I then added OpenWebUI and installed a SearXNG server to enable web search. \n\nWhile it works, by default I found it gave very poor response when web search is on. For example, I prompt \u201cwhat are the latest movies?\u201d The response was very short like a few sentence, and only said they are related to superheros, and it couldn\u2019t tell me the names of them at all. This is the case even if it said it has search through 10 or more website. \n\nThen I realized that by default it uses RAG on the web search results. By disabling it, I can actually get the same prompt above to give me a list of the movies and a short description, which I think is more informative. A problem without RAG is however it becomes very limited in the website it can include as it can go over even the 128k token window I am using. This makes the response slow and sometimes just leads to error of oversizing the context window.  \n\nIs there something I can do to keep using RAG but improve the response? For example, does the RAG/Document setting affect the web search RAG, and will it be better if I use a different embedding model (it seems I can change this under the Document tab)? Any ideas are appreciated. \n\nUpdate: Turns out this above is not exactly right: The tricky setting is also \"By pass web loader\".
