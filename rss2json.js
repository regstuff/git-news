Currently debating taking a year off and trying to get a job doing CRM or just going right for grad school.\n\nI am in my last year of my undergrad program, and am getting ready to graduate in June 2026. My professors have advised me to apply before I graduate to CRM companies in the hopes of casual field or office experience while I'm still in school, and given me a list of a few good ones. I'm currently applying for my first opportunity, but am struggling a bit with what to put on my cover letter. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to attend any field schools during my undergrad. My university is very small, and did not offer any during my time here - we do occasionally have the opportunity to participate in ones offered by the bigger universities, but costs are nearly doubled when you're from a different school. I've had to work retail/museum education jobs throughout the entirety of my degree to make ends meet, and I was never allowed to take the time off to attend even if I could have afforded it (even a week or two of missing work would have made me unable to pay bills/rent/food etc, never mind having to quit my job entirely.) \n\nMy prof (who worked in the industry for many years) assured me that I could still get in even without the field experience (especially because it was out of my control), but I have no idea what to list as a qualification other than my classes in ceramic analysis, GIS and basic methods courses. Of course, I have some skills from my employment, but nothing that I can see being particularly relevant to the field.  If anyone has any suggestions as to what might make me attractive to an archy firm, I would love some suggestions. To be more specific about my work history, I worked a couple summers at a museum as an in character interpreter (wore the historical costumes, pretended I was from the 18th century while giving education etc) and currently work in cannabis retail as a quasi-assistant manager. I've done well in all my classes, and am set to graduate on the dean's honour roll with a B+ to A average. I was also an Air Cadet for about five years as a teenager; I did survival camps through that program (making shelters, starting fires) and grew up camping in the Rocky Mountains. I know outdoor skills and a familiarity with the region's environment are pretty important for CRM.\n\n I am so eager and willing to learn anything I have to in order to pursue this career. We all have to start somewhere, right? \n\nThank you for any help in advance!!!
