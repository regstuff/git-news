I'm finding LLMs and neural NLP super interesting to maybe work with, and plan on doing a computational linguistics degree.\n\nNeuro-symbolic methods seem to be gaining traction nowadays, if not in the active NLP engineering field then in research. It really interests me, mainly because while I like ML and neural networks, being able to also integrate more traditional methods in programming, math, logic and linguistics seems great too. I'd like to ask: where is it heading, and where are neuro-symbolic methods proving better results?\n\nI understand that in most NLP engineering jobs, the focus is primarily, or practically 95% or even 99% neural. So I'm curious in which regards and specific applications of NLP is it showing results? One thing I do know is that the Arabic NLP tradition, while it is neural-based, still has a good bit of symbolic work in it as well since Arabic is rather complex.\n\nI'd also like to say that I don't mind working as an NLP engineer that only works with programming and math, but I'd also like to work in research integrating linguistics techniques. Though doing both may be hard I still have a pretty big passion for both mathematics, CS and linguistics, and doing just one is totally fine by me. \n\nRegards\n\nMM27", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nwt556/neurosymbolic_methods_in_nlp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Best settings to make SearXNG web search good?", "summary": "\n\nThese are my settings.

I get that from Gemini Flash Lite, fallback to gemini Flash in the (numerous) cases Flash Lite chokes on the task. Needs own API key, free tier provides a *very* generous quota for a single user.\n\n\\- Then my \"web page query\" lets the model request either a grounded summary for its query or a set of  excerpts directly asnweering it. It is another model in the background, given the query and the full text.\n\n\\- Finally my \"smart web scrape\" uses the existing Playwright (which I installed with OWUI as per OWUI documentation), but runs the result through Trafilatura, making it more compact.\n\nAnyone who wants these is welcome to them, but I kinda need help adapting this for more universal OWUI use. The current source is overfit to my setup, including a hardcoded endpoint (my local LiteLLM proxy), hardcoded model names, and the fact that I can use the OpenUI API to query Gemini with search enabled (thanks to the LiteLLM Proxy). Also the code shared between the tools is in a module that is just dropped into the PYTHONPATH. That same PYTHONPATH (on mounted storage, as I run OWUI containerized) is also used for the reqyured libraries. It's all in the README but I do see it would need some polishing if it were to go onto the OWUI website.\n\nPull requests or detailed advice on how to make things more palatable for generalize OWUI use are welsome.
