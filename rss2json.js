We\u2019ve grown, we\u2019ve learned, and the landscape of open source (especially at any meaningful scale) is as challenging and rewarding as ever. As always, we want to remain transparent, engage directly, and make sure our community feels heard.\n\nBelow is a reflection on open source realities, sustainability, and why we\u2019ve made the choices we have regarding maintenance, licensing, and ongoing work. (It\u2019s a bit long, but I hope you\u2019ll find it insightful\u2014even if you don\u2019t agree with everything!)\n\n\\---\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how often discussions about open source and sustainable projects get derailed by narratives that seem to ignore even the most basic economic realities. Before getting into the details, I want to emphasize that what follows isn\u2019t a definitive guide or universally \u201cright\u201d answer, it\u2019s a reflection of my own experiences, observations, and the lessons my team and I have picked up along the way. The world of open source, especially at any meaningful scale, doesn\u2019t come with a manual, and we\u2019re continually learning, adapting, and trying to do what\u2019s best for the project and its community. Others may have faced different challenges, or found approaches that work better for them, and that diversity of perspective is part of what makes this ecosystem so interesting. My hope is simply that by sharing our own thought process and the realities we\u2019ve encountered, it might help add a bit of context or clarity for anyone thinking about similar issues.\n\nFor those not deeply familiar with OSS project maintenance: open source is neither magic nor self-perpetuating. Code doesn\u2019t write itself, servers don\u2019t pay their own bills, and improvements don\u2019t happen merely through the power of communal critique. There is a certain romance in the idea of everything being open, free, and effortless, but reality is rarely so generous. A recurring misconception deserving urgent correction concerns how a serious project is actually operated and maintained at scale, especially in the world of \u201cfree\u201d software. Transparency doesn\u2019t consist of a swelling graveyard of Issues that no single developer or even a small team will take years or decades to resolve. If anything, true transparency and responsibility mean managing these tasks and conversations in a scalable, productive way. Converting Issues into Discussions, particularly using built-in platform features designed for this purpose, is a normal part of scaling open source process as communities grow. The role of Issues in a repository is to track actionable, prioritized items that the team can reasonably address in the near term. Overwhelming that system with hundreds or thousands of duplicate bug reports, wish-list items, requests from people who have made no attempt to follow guidelines, or details on non-reproducible incidents ultimately paralyzes any forward movement. It takes very little experience in actual large-scale collaboration to grasp that a streamlined, focused Issues board is vital, not villainous. The rest flows into discussions, exactly as platforms like GitHub intended. Suggesting that triaging and categorizing for efficiency, moving unreproducible bugs or priorities to the correct channels, shelving duplicates or off-topic requests, reflects some sinister lack of transparency is deeply out of touch with both the scale of contribution and the human bandwidth available.\n\nLet\u2019s talk the myth that open source can run entirely on the noble intentions of volunteers or the inertia of the internet. For an uncomfortably long stretch of this project\u2019s life, there was exactly one engineer, Tim, working unpaid, endlessly and often at personal financial loss, tirelessly keeping the lights on and code improving, pouring in not only nights and weekends but literal cash to keep servers online. Those server bills don\u2019t magically zero out at midnight because a project is \u201copen\u201d or \u201cbeloved.\u201d Reality is often starker: you are left sacrificing sleep, health, and financial security for the sake of a community that, in its loudest quarters, sometimes acts as if your obligation is infinite, unquestioned, and invisible. It's worth emphasizing: there were months upon months with literally a negative income stream, no outside sponsorships, and not a cent of personal profit. Even in a world where this is somehow acceptable for the owner, but what kind of dystopian logic dictates that future team members, hypothetically with families, sick children to care for, rent and healthcare and grocery bills, are expected to step into unpaid, possibly financially draining roles simply because a certain vocal segment expects everything built for them, with no thanks given except more demands? If the expectation is that contribution equals servitude, years of volunteering plus the privilege of community scorn, perhaps a rethink of fundamental fairness is in order.\n\nThe essential point missed in these critiques is that scaling a project to properly fix bugs, add features, and maintain a high standard of quality requires human talent. Human talent, at least in the world we live in, expects fair and humane compensation. You cannot tempt world-class engineers and maintainers with shares of imagined community gratitude. Salaries are not paid in GitHub upvotes, nor will critique, however artful, ever underwrite a family\u2019s food, healthcare, or education. This is the very core of why license changes are necessary and why only a very small subsection of open source maintainers are able to keep working, year after year, without burning out, moving on, or simply going broke. The license changes now in effect are precisely so that, instead of bugs sitting for months unfixed, we might finally be able to pay, and thus, retain, the people needed to address exactly the problems that now serve as touchpoint for complaint. It\u2019s a strategy motivated not by greed or covert commercialism, but by our desire to keep contributing, keep the project alive for everyone, not just for a short time but for years to come, and not leave a graveyard of abandoned issues for the next person to clean up.\n\nAny suggestion that these license changes are somehow a betrayal of open source values falls apart upon the lightest reading of their actual terms. If you take a moment to examine those changes, rather than react to rumors, you\u2019ll see they are meant to be as modest as possible. Literally: keep the branding or attribution and you remain free to use the project, at any scale you desire, whether for personal use or as the backbone of a startup with billions of users. The only ask is minimal, visible, non-intrusive attribution as a nod to the people and sacrifice behind your free foundation. If, for specific reasons, your use requires stripping that logo, the license simply expects that you either be a genuinely small actor (for whom impact is limited and support need is presumably lower), a meaningful contributor who gives back code or resources, or an organization willing to contribute to the sustainability which benefits everyone. It\u2019s not a limitation; it\u2019s common sense. The alternative, it seems, is the expectation that creators should simply give up and hand everything away, then be buried under user demands when nothing improves. Or worse, be forced to sell to a megacorp, or take on outside investment that would truly compromise independence, freedom, and the user-first direction of the project. This was a carefully considered, judiciously scoped change, designed not to extract unfair value, but to guarantee there is still value for anyone to extract a year from now.\n\nEqually, the kneejerk suspicion of commercialization fails to acknowledge the practical choices at hand. If we genuinely wished to sell out or lock down every feature, there were and are countless easier paths: flood the core interface with ads, disappear behind a subscription wall, or take venture capital and prioritize shareholder return over community need. Not only have we not taken those routes, there have been months where the very real choice was to dig into personal pockets (again, without income), all to ensure the platform would survive another week. VC money is never free, and the obligations it entails often run counter to open source values and user interests. We chose the harder, leaner, and far less lucrative road so that independence and principle remain intact. Yet instead of seeing this as the solid middle ground it is, one designed to keep the project genuinely open and moving forward, it gets cast as some betrayal by those unwilling or unable to see the math behind payroll, server upkeep, and the realities of life for working engineers. Our intention is to create a sustainable, independent project. We hope this can be recognized as an honest effort at a workable balance, even if it won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s ideal.\n\nNot everyone has experience running the practical side of open projects, and that\u2019s understandable, it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s easy to miss until you\u2019ve lived it. There is a cost to everything. The relentless effort, the discipline required to keep a project alive while supporting a global user base, and the repeated sacrifice of time, money, and peace of mind, these are all invisible in the abstract but measured acutely in real life. Our new license terms simply reflect a request for shared responsibility, a basic, almost ceremonial gesture honoring the chain of effort that lets anyone, anywhere, build on this work at zero cost, so long as they acknowledge those enabling it. If even this compromise is unacceptable, then perhaps it is worth considering what kind of world such entitlement wishes to create: one in which contributors are little more than expendable, invisible labor to be discarded at will.\n\nDespite these frustrations, I want to make eminently clear how deeply grateful we are to the overwhelming majority of our community: users who read, who listen, who contribute back, donate, and, most importantly, understand that no project can grow in a vacuum of support. Your constant encouragement, your sharp eyes, and your belief in the potential of this codebase are what motivate us to continue working, year after year, even when the numbers make no sense. It is for you that this project still runs, still improves, and still pushes forward, not just today, but into tomorrow and beyond.\n\n\u2014 Tim\n\n\\---\n\n**AMA TIME!**  \nI\u2019d love to answer any questions you might have about:\n\n* Project maintenance\n* Open source sustainability\n* Our license/model changes\n* Burnout, compensation, and project scaling\n* The future of Open WebUI\n* Or anything else related (technical or not!)\n\nSeriously, ask me anything \u2013 whether you\u2019re a developer, user, lurker, critic, or just open source curious.

Just like marketers deliver better campaigns when they get clear instructions from their bosses.", "summary": "I\u2019m a marketer, and I didn\u2019t use AI much before, but now it\u2019s become a daily essential. At first, I honestly thought GPT couldn't understand me or offer useful help, it gave me such nonsense answers. Then I realized the real issue was that I didn't know how to write good prompts. Without clear prompts, GPT couldn\u2019t know what I was aiming for.\n\nThings changed after I found this guide from OpenAI, it helped me get more relevant results from GPT. Here are some tips from the guide that I think other marketers could apply immediately:\n\n* **Campaign copy testing:**\u00a0Break down your request into smaller parts (headline ideas \u2192 body copy \u2192 CTAs), then quickly A/B test each segment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Personally, I always start by having GPT write the body copy first, then refine it until it's solid. Next, I move on to the headline, and finally, the CTA. I never ask GPT to tackle all three at once. Doing it step-by-step makes editing much simpler and helps GPT produce smarter results.\n\n* **Brand tone consistency:**\u00a0Always save a \u201creference paragraph\u201d from previous successful campaigns, then include it whenever you brief ChatGPT.\n* **Rapid ideation:**\u00a0Upload your focus-group notes and ask GPT for key insights and creative angles before starting your actual brainstorming. The document-upload trick is seriously a game-changer.\n\n# The key takeaway is: write clearly.\n\nHere are 3 examples demonstrating why a clear prompt matters so much:\n\n* **Okay prompt:**\u00a0\"Create an agenda for next week\u2019s staff meeting.\"\n* **Good prompt:**\u00a0\"Create an agenda for our weekly school staff meeting that includes updates on attendance trends, upcoming events, and reminders about progress reports.\"\n* **Great prompt:**\u00a0\"Prepare a structured agenda for our weekly K\u20138 staff meeting. Include 10 minutes for reviewing attendance and behavior trends, 15 minutes for planning next month\u2019s family engagement night, 10 minutes to review progress report timelines, and 5 minutes for open staff questions. Format it to support efficient discussion and clear action items.\"\n\nSee the difference? Clear prompts consistently deliver better results, just like how receiving specific instructions from your boss helps you understand exactly what you need to do.\n\nThis guide includes lots more practical tips, the ones I mentioned here are just the start.

But using a carefully designed prompt, I got a mainstream LLM (GPT-4.5 class) to solve N = 15 \u2014 all 32,767 steps, with zero errors \u2014 just by changing how I prompted it. I asked it to output the solution in batches of 100 steps, not all at once. This post shares the prompt and why this works.\n\nApple\u2019s \u201cIllusion of Thinking\u201d paper\n\n\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\uddea 1. Background: What Apple Found\n\nApple tested several state-of-the-art reasoning models on Tower of Hanoi and observed a performance \u201ccollapse\u201d when N \u2265 10 \u2014 meaning LLMs completely fail to solve the problem. For N = 15, the solution requires 32,767 steps (2\u00b9\u2075\u20131), which pushes LLMs beyond what they can plan or remember in one shot.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udde9 2. My Experiment: N = 15 Works, with the Right Prompt\n\nI tested the same task using a mainstream LLM in the GPT-4.5 tier. But instead of asking it to solve the full problem in one go, I gave it this incremental, memory-friendly prompt:\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2705 3. The Prompt That Worked (100 Steps at a Time)\n\nLet\u2019s solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for N = 15, with disks labeled from 1 (smallest) to 15 (largest).\n\nRules:\n- Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n- A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.\n- Use three pegs: A (start), B (auxiliary), C (target).\n\nYour task: Move all 15 disks from peg A to peg C following the rules.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Do NOT generate all steps at once.\n- Output ONLY the next 100 moves, in order.\n- After the 100 steps, STOP and wait for me to say: \"go on\" before continuing.\n\nNow begin: Show me the first 100 moves.\n\nEvery time I typed go on, the LLM correctly picked up from where it left off and generated the next 100 steps. This continued until it completed all 32,767 moves.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 4. Results\n\t\u2022\t\u2705 All steps were valid and rule-consistent.\n\t\u2022\t\u2705 Final state was correct: all disks on peg C.\n\t\u2022\t\u2705 Total number of moves = 32,767.\n\t\u2022\t\ud83e\udde0 Verified using a simple web-based simulator I built (also powered by Claude 4 Sonnet).\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udde0 5. Why This Works: Prompting Reduces Cognitive Load\n\nLLMs are autoregressive and have limited attention spans. When you ask them to plan out tens of thousands of steps:\n\t\u2022\tThey drift, hallucinate, or give up.\n\t\u2022\tThey can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d that far ahead.\n\nBut by chunking the task:\n\t\u2022\tWe offload long-term planning to the user (like a \u201cscheduler\u201d),\n\t\u2022\tEach batch is local, easier to reason about,\n\t\u2022\tIt\u2019s like \u201cpaging\u201d memory in classical computation.\n\nIn short: We stop treating LLMs like full planners \u2014 and treat them more like step-by-step executors with bounded memory.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udde8 6. Why Apple\u2019s Experiment Fails\n\nTheir prompt (not shown in full) appears to ask models to:\n\nSolve Tower of Hanoi with N = 10 (or more) in a single output.\n\nThat\u2019s like asking a human to write down 1,023 chess moves without pause \u2014 you\u2019ll make mistakes. Their conclusion is:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cLLMs collapse\u201d\n\t\u2022\t\u201cThey have no general reasoning ability\u201d\n\nBut the real issue may be:\n\t\u2022\tPrompt design failed to respect the mechanics of LLMs.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udded 7. What This Implies for AI Reasoning\n\t\u2022\tLLMs can solve very complex recursive problems \u2014 if we structure the task right.\n\t\u2022\tPrompting is more than instruction: it\u2019s cognitive ergonomics.\n\t\u2022\tInstead of expecting LLMs to handle everything alone, we can offload memory and control flow to humans or interfaces.\n\nThis is how real-world agents and tools will use LLMs \u2014 not by throwing everything at them in one go.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Discussion Points\n\t\u2022\tHave you tried chunked prompting on other \u201ccollapse-prone\u201d problems?\n\t\u2022\tShould benchmarks measure prompt robustness, not just model accuracy?\n\t\u2022\tIs stepwise prompting a hack, or a necessary interface for reasoning?\n\nHappy to share the web simulator or prompt code if helpful.
