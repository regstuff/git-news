I posted here a while back about pivoting to CRM from old world archaeology, and I'm back because I'll be graduating this year and want to try working in CRM for a bit after graduation. I'm from the Midwest and am about to graduate this spring. I'd love to work in the Southwest, in the four corners states (but especially New Mexico) and I'm wondering where to live and how to make that work.\n\nSpecifically, I'm interested in hearing from field techs where you live relative to where you work, and what that looks like on days off -- do you drive all the way home? Do you shell out for the extra hotel nights? I'd love to be able to save as much money as possible but am also interested in the practicalities of things. Is it stupid to relocate to the region and pay for an apartment I won't see more than two days out of most weeks?\n\nOn top of this, my girlfriend lives with her family in north Texas. We'd love to move in together but she's also wary about uprooting herself and moving to a new city where she doesn't know anyone and when I'd be gone most days. Does anyone have insight about where to live while doing CRM, how the commute works, and how to make a relationship work with all of that?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1hxmhib/crm_location_and_lifestyle/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran might change its capital", "summary": "Iran is reportedly considering relocating its capital from Tehran to Makran in response to challenges such as overpopulation, water scarcity, and frequent power cuts. While this move may not have a direct impact on the ongoing Israel-Iran tensions, it could trigger significant geopolitical shifts in the region.\n\nOne of the key implications is its potential to accelerate development of the Chabahar port, located near the proposed new capital. Chabahar, developed by India, plays a vital role in facilitating trade between India, Iran, and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. The relocation of Iran's capital to Makran, situated close to this critical trade hub, could strengthen Iran's role in regional connectivity, particularly along the Russia-Central Asia-Iran-India route.\n\nHowever, the new capital's proximity to Pakistan's Balochistan province raises significant security concerns. Balochistan is an unstable region, plagued by ethnic insurgency and terrorism, which has historically been supported by elements within Pakistan. The new capital\u2019s location could exacerbate tensions with Pakistan, and increase the risks of cross-border instability. Iran would likely need to invest heavily in securing the area to prevent destabilization.\n\nThis potential move could reshape the geopolitical landscape in the region, particularly in relation to India, Pakistan, and Iran\u2019s broader strategic objectives.\n\nThoughts?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1hxhclm/iran_might_change_its_capital/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish president seeks protection for Netanyahu if he attends Auschwitz anniversary event", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/poland-israel-netanyahu-warrant-duda-auschwitz-anniversary-3b672818016198f4247917e3587e2913", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Meta Secretly Trained Its AI on a Notorious Russian 'Shadow Library,' Newly Unredacted Court Docs Reveal", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/new-documents-unredacted-meta-copyright-ai-lawsuit/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "source-to-llm: A CLI tool to extract and format source code for LLM prompts | Node.js CLI that prepares your codebase for AI analysis", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/ai-belov/source-to-llm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jimmy Carter's charity spared millions of people from Guinea worm, a debilitating parasite", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jimmy-carter-who-died-at-age-100-spared-millions-of-people-from-guinea-worm/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hostage Is Found Dead in Gaza Tunnel", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostage-found-dead.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "IDF restricts media coverage of soldiers to protect them from risk of legal action", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/idf-restricts-media-coverage-of-soldiers-to-protect-them-from-risk-of-legal-action", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India looks to dissuade Indonesian president from clubbing R-Day visit with Pakistan travel | India News - Times of India", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-looks-to-dissuade-indonesian-president-from-clubbing-r-day-visit-with-pakistan-travel/articleshow/117095932.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India\u2019s Response to World\u2019s Largest Dam in China Faces Local Opposition", "summary": "", "link": "https://thediplomat.com/2025/01/indias-response-to-worlds-largest-dam-in-china-faces-local-opposition/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
