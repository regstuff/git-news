They evaluated the models' ability to infer depth and surface information from an image and to generate consistent representations across multiple viewpoints.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 The results show that some models, such as DINO, DINOv2, and StableDiffusion, are partially able to encode 3D information without being explicitly trained to do so. In contrast, models trained with vision-language pre-training, such as CLIP, hardly captured any 3D information.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 All of the models tested showed weaknesses when it came to consistency across multiple viewing angles. The team therefore suggests that the models learn viewpoint-dependent (2.5D) representations rather than true 3D-consistent representations.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1cj6oc9/probe3d_study_examines_how_well_ai_models/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India and New Zealand to strengthen economic ties, explore collaboration in key sectors", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/diplomacy/india-and-new-zealand-to-strengthen-economic-ties-explore-collaboration-in-key-sectors/2067301/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Don\u2019t die, I will be back\u2019: Oklahoma boy saves parents after tornado tosses truck", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/oklahoma-boy-saves-parents-tornado", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Washington buys 81 Soviet-era combat aircraft from Kazakhstan, report says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-buys-81-soviet-fighter-jets-from-russian-ally-20k-2024-4?op=1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "BandKit - A Kotlin Multiplatform library to interface with Bandcamp's API", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/har-nick/BandKit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "After 18-month gap, China to send new ambassador to India this month", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-18-month-gap-china-to-send-new-ambassador-to-india-this-month-101714665607378.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World Press Freedom Day: Journalism not being protected, report says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy73gq39219o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran says journalists charged after BBC report on protester death", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnd6k8ggzn2o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Indonesia strengthen defence partnership under Act East Policy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.financialexpress.com/business/defence-india-indonesia-strengthen-defence-partnership-under-act-east-policy-3476520/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Recommendations for text classification of high level conceptual categories", "summary": "Hello lovely people of r/LanguageTechnology !\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am working on a project, and would love any suggestions. I am a psychology researcher trying to utilize NLP for qualitative research with a dataset of \\~350,000 social media posts related to my topic (a specific component of wellbeing). I would like do do a few text categorizations:   \n\n\nFirst a binary classification, relevant or irrelevant (I have done a lot of cleaning, but there is a limit to how much I can exclude before I start removing relevant posts, so my thought was to train a classifier to filter out irrelevant posts).   \n\n\nSecond, sentiment (likely positive, negative, and neutral, though maybe just positive and negative)  \n\n\nAnd finally, three different theoretical dimensions/categories of the wellbeing concept I am analyzing (This one I am sure will be the most difficult, but also potentially isn't completely necessary, it would just be very cool). These would not be mutually exclusive.   \n\n\nI have been reading so much about transformers vs sentence transformers, and have also considered using an LLM (especially for the 3rd task, as it is highly conceptual and I could see a LLM having some advantage with that). I have also looked into using this framework, Adala ([ for using an LLM - it looks promising to me. I also have considered fine-tuning a small LLM such as Phi-3 for this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations? I have also gone back and forth whether I should train 3 separate models, or attempt to do it all as one big multi-class classification (it seems like with something like Adala I could do this). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny recommendations?
