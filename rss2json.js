He sold the song rights for 10 shillings (less than $2), and he died virtually penniless, with his estate not seeing any royalties for decades.", "summary": "Sources:\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\nThe TL;DR version of the story is Solomon Linda and his vocal group The Evening Birds recorded the song Mbube in 1939 (\u201dmbube\u201d means lion in Zulu). The song was a big hit in its native South Africa. But Linda sold the song rights away for 10 shillings or 2 US dollars. According to Linda\u2019s daughters, their father did this unknowingly as he was illiterate (I\u2019m not sure if they mean he wasn\u2019t literate in any language or if he was just illiterate in the language of the contract, which I\u2019m guessing was probably Afrikaans). Linda continued performing through the 40s and 50s, even after The Evening Birds broke up in 1948. In the meantime, the track found its way to America, where it was sampled first by The Weavers in 1951 and then by The Tokens in 1961 as The Lion Sleeps Tonight. The Tokens' cover is when the song\u2019s popularity took off, and it would be later estimated that just from the song\u2019s use in the Disney movie The Lion King, Linda\u2019s estate would be entitled to 15 million dollars. Despite this, Linda spent the rest of his life in abject poverty, with one of his children dying due to malnutrition. When Linda passed away in 1962, he allegedly only had $25 left in his bank account, and his family could not afford a tombstone. When the story was first widely covered by the South African press around the year 2000, Linda\u2019s surviving children were still financially struggling, and one of his daughters had recently passed away from AIDS. Reporting by South African journalist Rian Malan and a subsequent documentary by filmmaker Francois Verster brought the story to wider attention, sparking an outcry in South Africa and around the world. In 2004, Linda\u2019s descendants sued Disney for unpaid royalties, and in 2006, a settlement was reached in which Disney agreed to pay the Linda family royalties for both past and future uses of \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight.\" A surprisingly good ending to the story.", "link": "https://i.redd.it/s4j1kgnuv4jf1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lacquer - GitHub Actions for AI Workflows (Single Go Binary, Zero Python Dependencies)", "summary": "Hey all, wanted to share an open source project I've been working on.\n\nLacquer is an AI orchestration engine that brings the GitHub Actions experience to AI workflows.
