Maybe It's a Paradox...", "summary": "We all hear about how the Harappan cities (Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, etc.) were incredibly advanced for their time\u2014well-planned streets, sophisticated drainage systems, and thriving trade networks. They\u2019re often considered the most modern cities of their era. But, what if there\u2019s another way to look at it? Could it be that these cities were, in a way, a \"fail city\"?\n\nThe Harappan civilization was known for its impressive engineering and city planning, but something went wrong. These cities were suddenly abandoned, and we still don\u2019t know exactly why. Was it climate change? A shift in the rivers? Maybe their grand vision just couldn\u2019t last because they couldn\u2019t sustain it. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know, and that makes it even more intriguing.\n\nIt kind of reminds me of Lavasa\u2014a modern city built with tons of ambition but facing economic and environmental struggles despite all the hype. They had this dream of creating a perfect city, but the reality didn\u2019t quite match up. And in a way, Harappa had this grand vision too, but it didn't survive forever.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though: We still don\u2019t know much about why Harappa declined. Was it a natural collapse, or was there something deeper at play? Honestly, it\u2019s all still up in the air. And that makes it all the more paradoxical.\n\nSo, is it fair to call Harappa a \u201cfail city\u201d? Maybe not, but it\u2019s definitely an interesting thought.

In this method, It first uses a special RNN unit to go over all the inputs of the sequence, and generates an embedding with length M. Then, it does a linear transformation using this embedding with a matirx of shape (N X N) X\u00a0\u00a0M.\n\nNext, reshape the resulting vector to a matrix with shape N x N. This matrix is dynamic, its values depends on the inputs, whereas the previous (N X N) X\u00a0\u00a0M matrix is fixed and trained.\n\nThen, times all input vectors with the matrix to output new vectors with length N.\n\nAll the steps above is one layer of the structure, and can be repeated many times.\n\nAfter several layers, concatanate the output of all the layers. if you have Z layers, the length of the new vector will be ZN.\n\nFinally, use the special RNN unit to process the whole sequence to give the final result(after adding several Dense layers).\n\nThe full detail is in this code, including how the RNN unit works and how positional encoding is added:\u00a0\n\n[\n\n\u00a0\n\nContact me if you are interested in the algorithm, My name is Yanlong and my email is\u00a0[y35lyu@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:y35lyu@uwaterloo.ca)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1id51x6/a_structure_that_potentially_replaces_transformer/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I made a website to track community weather stations across the globe!", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/NateBrune/Weather-Index", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rare votive treasures of the Cham people found in \u201cSacred Pit\u201d", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.heritagedaily.com/2025/01/rare-votive-treasures-of-the-champa-people-found-in-sacred-pit/154368", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Salwan Momika, Man Who Burnt Quran In 2023 Sparking Huge Protests Shot Dead In Sweden", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/salwan-momika-man-who-burnt-quran-in-2023-sparking-huge-protests-shot-dead-in-sweden-7593887/amp/1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India\u2019s has \u2018legitimate\u2019 concerns over pro-Khalistan movement in Canada: Inquiry commission", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-has-legitimate-concerns-over-the-pro-khalistan-movement-in-canada-inquiry-commission-101738129336356.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Women in secretary positions.", "summary": "", "link": "/r/Historians/comments/1idbdmd/women_in_secretary_positions/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thailand makes hormone therapy free for trans people just after legalizing marriage equality", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/01/thailand-makes-hormone-therapy-free-for-trans-poeple/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Discovery of a unique drainage and irrigation system that gave way to the 'Neolithic Revolution' in the Amazon", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-01-discovery-unique-drainage-irrigation-gave.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada commission report finds 'no definitive link' between Nijjar killing and India", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/canada-commission-report-finds-no-definitive-link-between-hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-and-india/cid/2080424", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh cancels football match after hundreds of protesters march field | World News - The Times of India", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/mad-mad-world/girls-football-is-un-islamic-bangladesh-cancels-football-match-after-hundreds-of-protesters-march-field/articleshow/117719831.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Workers at Philadelphia Whole Foods vote to form first union for Amazon-owned supermarket chain | CNN Business", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/business/whole-foods-philadelphia-union-hnk/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Far-right vote on asylum rocks German parliament", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceq901dxjnzo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Far-right Romanian presidential candidate wants Ukraine to be divided and part of it taken over by Romania", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/30/7495925/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scientists sound the alarm after finding thousands of seabirds dead on beaches: 'The message is clear'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/seabird-deaths-alaska-marine-heatwaves/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Remote sensing tools yield insights into abandoned pre-Columbian Mexican city", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-01-remote-tools-yield-insights-abandoned.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel and the delusions of Germany\u2019s \u2018memory culture\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jan/30/israel-and-the-delusions-of-germanys-memory-culture", "author": "None"}, {"title": "U.S. life expectancy rose significantly last year, hitting highest level since pandemic", "summary": "&gt;U.S. life expectancy rose last year, hitting its highest level since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n&gt;The report, released Thursday, found that life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023.
