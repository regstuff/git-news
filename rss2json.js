That is far more than the 87,600 who speak\u00a0[Kashubian]( a language native to northern Poland that is currently the country\u2019s only recognised regional language.\n\nSuch official recognition allows a language to be taught in schools and used in local administration in municipalities where at least 20% of the population declared in the last census that they speak it. It also provides additional funding for preserving the language.\n\nIn a vote on Friday in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, a majority of 244 MPs supported the bill. They came almost entirely from Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition, which stretches from left to centre right.\n\nThe 196 votes against the bill came from the right-wing opposition, made up of the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) and some smaller factions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cRecognising Silesian as a regional language is not a symbolic or political gesture \u2013 it is an act of justice, consistency and respect for facts,\u201d declared Danuta Jaz\u0142owiecka, an MP from Tusk\u2019s centrist Civic Coalition (KO) who is from Silesia and represents a Silesian district in the Sejm.\n\n\u201cRecognising Silesian does not threaten the unity of the state,\u201d she added. \u201cOn the contrary, it strengthens it, showing that the republic is a community that is open, respecting its internal richness and diversity.\u201d\n\nHowever, Witold Tumanowicz of Confederation declared that \u201cSilesian is a branch of the Polish language, a natural element of its richness, and not an entity that must be artificially separated out by an administrative decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe linguistic bureaucrats want to regulate people\u2019s speech, create new commissions, change laws, and impose further obligations. But why?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe bill now passes to the upper-house Senate, where the government also has a majority and which can in any case only delay, rather than block, the legislation. If approved by parliament, it then moves to the desk of President Nawrocki, who was elected last year with the support of PiS.\n\nWhen, in 2024, Tusk\u2019s coalition\u00a0[passed a previous bill recognising Silesian]( it was vetoed by PiS-aligned President Duda, who claimed that it is an \u201cethnolect\u201d that does not meet the criteria of a language laid out in the 2005 law regulating Poland\u2019s recognised ethnic minorities and regional languages.\n\nDuda also voiced his concern that, if Silesian were recognised as a regional language, it could \u201cresult in similar expectations among representatives of other regional groups who want to cultivate their local tongues\u201d.\n\nFinally, the president also cited national security concerns in relation to the \u201ccurrent social and geopolitical situation\u2026related to the war being waged on the eastern border\u201d. At such a time, there must be \u201cspecial care to preserve national identity\u201d, including \u201ccultivating the native language\u201d.\n\nNeither Nawrocki nor his office have so far commented on what his decision may be. However, given how his right-wing allies in parliament voted, and given Duda\u2019s earlier veto, it appears likely that Nawrocki will refuse to sign the bill.\n\nIn October, Nawrocki\u00a0[vetoed a bill that would have recognised Wymysorys]( which is spoken by less than 100 people in one small Polish town, as an official regional language. He cited linguists\u2019 doubts over whether Wymysorys is a language or an ethnolect.\n\nA presidential veto can only be overturned with a three-fifths majority in the Sejm, something that would be impossible to achieve in this case of the Silesian language law, as the ruling coalition has only a narrow majority in parliament.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/10/law-recognising-silesian-as-regional-language-in-poland-approved-by-parliament/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Marine Le Pen's political fate rests on appeal trial opening in France", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62vnvx2x2po", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How one woman lures foreign recruits to Russia\u2019s front line in Ukraine", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9yv4gmn9lo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Greenland, Venezuela crises fuel European war economy mega-spend", "summary": "", "link": "https://archive.is/rCRi6", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Moldova\u2019s Sandu says she would vote for reunification with Romania", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/maia-sandu-moldova-vote-reunification-romania/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan Paramilitary Strike on Southeastern City Kills 27", "summary": "", "link": "https://thedefensepost.com/2026/01/13/sudan-paramilitary-southeastern-strike/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Red lines and increasing self-censorship reshape Hong Kong's once freewheeling press scene", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-media-changes-press-f4960fa39ff7f06e171a0ce88d1e9151", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
