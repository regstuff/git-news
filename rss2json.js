Every time I asked AI to generate a full design, I\u2019d get something that looked *okay.* Decent structure, colors in place. But it always felt incomplete. Spacing was off, components looked inconsistent, and I\u2019d end up spending hours fixing little details manually.\n\nEventually, I realized I was approaching AI the wrong way. I was expecting it to nail everything in one go, which almost never works. Same as if you told a human designer, *\u201cMake me the perfect app UI in one shot.\u201d*\n\nSo I started treating AI like a **junior UI/UX designer**:\n\n* First, I let it create a rough draft.\n* Then I have it polish and refine page by page.\n* Finally, I guide it on micro details. One tiny part at a time.\n\nThis layered approach changed everything for me. I call it the **Zoom-In Method.** Every pass zooms in closer until the design is basically production-ready. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n# 1. First pass (50%) \u2013 Full vision / rough draft\n\nThis is where I give AI **all the context I have** about the app. Context is everything here. The more specific, the better the rough draft. You could even write your entire vision in a **Markdown file with 100\u2013150 lines** covering every page, feature, and detail. And you can even use another AI to help you write that file based on your ideas.\n\nYou can also **provide a lot of screenshots or examples of designs you like. T**his helps guide the AI visually and keeps the style closer to what you\u2019re aiming for.\n\n**Pro tip:** If you have the code for a component or a full page design that you like, copy-paste that code and mention it to the AI. Tell it to use the same design approach, color palette, and structure across the rest of the pages. This will instantly boost **consistency** throughout your UI.\n\n# Example: E-commerce Admin Dashboard\n\nLet\u2019s say I\u2019m designing an **admin dashboard for an e-commerce platform**. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d provide AI in the first pass:\n\n* **Goal:** Dashboard for store owners to manage products, orders, and customers.\n* **Core features:** Product CRUD, order tracking, analytics, customer profiles.\n* **Core pages:** Dashboard overview, products page, orders page, analytics page, customers page, and settings.\n* **Color palette:** White/neutral base with accents of #4D93F8 (blue) and #2A51C1 (dark blue).\n* **Style:** Clean, modern, minimal. Focus on clarity, no clutter.\n* **Target audience:** Store owners who want a quick overview of business health.\n* **Vibe:** Professional but approachable (not overly corporate).\n* **Key UI elements:** Sidebar navigation, top navbar, data tables, charts, cards for metrics, search/filter components.\n\n*Note:* This example is **not detailed enough.** It\u2019s just to showcase the idea. In practice, you should really include every single thing in your mind so the AI fully understands the components it needs to build and the design approach it should follow. As always, **the more context you give, the better the output will be.**\n\nI don\u2019t worry about perfection here. I just let the AI spit out the full rough draft of the UI. At this stage, it\u2019s usually around **50% done.** functional but still has a lot of errors and weird placements, and inconsistencies.\n\n# 2. Second pass (99%) \u2013 Zoom in and polish\n\nHere\u2019s where the magic happens. Instead of asking AI to fix *everything* at once, I tell it to **focus on one page at a time** and improve it using best practices.\n\nWhat surprised me the most when I started doing this is **how self-aware AI can be** when you make it reflect on its own work. I\u2019d tell it to look back and fix mistakes, and it would point out issues I hadn\u2019t even noticed. Like inconsistent padding or slightly off font sizes. This step alone saves me **hours of back-and-forth** because AI catches a huge chunk of its mistakes here.\n\nThe prompt I use talks to AI directly, like it\u2019s reviewing its own work:\n\nGo through the \\[here you should mention the exact page the ai should go through\\] you just created and improve it significantly:\n\n* Reflect on mistakes you made, inconsistencies, and anything visually off.\n* Apply modern UI/UX best practices (spacing, typography, alignment, hierarchy, color balance, accessibility).\n* Make sure the layout feels balanced and professional while keeping the same color palette and vision.\n* Fix awkward placements, improve component consistency and make sure everything looks professional and polished.\n\nDoing this page by page gets me to around **99% of what I want to achieve it. But still there might be some modifications I want to add or Specific designs in my mind, animations, etc.. and here is where the third part comes.**\n\n# 3. Micro pass (99% \u2192 100%) \u2013 Final polish\n\nThis last step is where I go *super specific*. Instead of prompting AI to improve a whole page, I point it to **tiny details** or special ideas I want added, things like:\n\n* Fixing alignment on the navbar.\n* Perfecting button hover states.\n* Adjusting the spacing between table rows.\n* Adding subtle animations or micro-interactions.\n* Fixing small visual bugs or awkward placements.\n\nIn this part, being specific is the most important thing. You can provide screenshots, explain what you want in detail, describe the exact animation you want, and mention the specific component. Basically, more context equals much better results.\n\nI repeat this process for each small section until everything feels exactly right. At this point, I\u2019ve gone from 50% \u2192 99% \u2192 100% polished in a fraction of the time it used to take.\n\n# Why this works\n\nAI struggles when you expect perfection in one shot. But when you **layer the instructions,** big picture first, then details, then micro details. It starts catching mistakes it missed before and produces something way more refined.\n\nIt\u2019s actually similar to how **UI/UX designers** work:\n\n* They start with low-fidelity wireframes to capture structure and flow.\n* Then they move to high-fidelity mockups to refine style, spacing, and hierarchy.\n* Finally, they polish micro-interactions, hover states, and pixel-perfect spacing.\n\nThis is exactly what we\u2019re doing here. Just guiding AI through the same layered workflow a real designer would follow. The other key factor is **context**: the more context and specificity you give AI (exact sections, screenshots, precise issues), the better it performs. Without context, it guesses; with context, it just executes correctly.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nThis method completely cut down my back-and-forth time with AI. What used to take me 6\u20138 hours of tweaking, I now get done in 1\u20132 hours. And the results are way cleaner and closer to what I want.\n\nI also have some other UI/AI tips I\u2019ve learned along the way.
