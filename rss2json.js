She quickly headed out, hoping to avoid the crowd that had already burned down the offices of Prothom Alo, another of Bangladesh\u2019s most prestigious newspapers. But when she reached the door, they were already there.\n\nThe rioters were angered by the assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent leader from the pro-democracy movement that unseated the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. Hadi\u2019s killers were Hasina loyalists who had escaped to India, according to the authorities. The crowd that had rapidly gathered on the night of 18 December was ready to lash out at anyone they saw as linked to the previous government.\n\nProthom Alo and the Daily Star were targeted, despite having faced vandalism, abuse, and legal action under Hasina\u2019s rule.\n\nIt was a night that saw both newspaper offices and a cultural institution burned down, causing consternation among journalists and civil society about the trajectory of Bangladesh just 15 months after the end of Hasina\u2019s 15 years of autocratic rule had kindled hope for a new type of politics.\n\nSo far 184 people have been killed this year in incidents of mob violence, according to figures up to November compiled by the human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra. Last Thursday, a Hindu garment worker was dragged out and lynched after rumours had spreadaccusing him of blasphemy. By comparison, there were 51 such deaths in 2023.\n\nAs the violence erupted on 18 December, Islam, a 35-year-old reporter, and 28 of her colleagues rushed to the roof hoping to wait out the violence. \u201cWe all knew that this mob was not going to stop at trashing this office, that it was going to set fire to it,\u201d she says.\n\nAt one point, choking on smoke so thick she could not see the phone in her hands, Islam posted to Facebook what she thought would her final message: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe any more. There\u2019s too much smoke. I\u2019m inside. You are killing me.\u201d\n\n...\n\nA journalist from Prothom Alo, who did not want to be named, said that watching from the 13th floor of the building as the crowd gathered below made them realise how just far the country had strayed from the hope of August 2024.\n\nHasina\u2019s rule saw the political opposition crushed and the media silenced, but when she was removed last year, the young protest leaders spoke of a \u201cBangladesh 2.0\u201d, which would break away from the violence and retribution of the old political parties.\n\n...\n\nIslam says she would not have wanted the security forces to fire on the crowds but more should have been done to protect the journalists.\n\nShe is also concerned that Bangladesh has been held hostage by a cycle of retribution since the 2024 protests that saw 1,400 people killed by Hasina\u2019s forces and which were followed by attacks on the police and anyone deemed loyal to her Awami League party.\n\nIslam believes, however, that there is a chance to escape that cycle of violence by taking last week\u2019s attacks as a warning and encouraging the government to act.\n\nOne way to do that, she says, is to ensure that those arrested are genuine culprits and not just detentions in the sweeping police raids that are common in Bangladesh, simply to signal that action is being taken, she says.\n\n\u201cI have my fingers crossed that that\u2019s the one thing that doesn\u2019t happen because I don\u2019t want to perpetuate a culture of revenge.\n\n\u201cWe still have a little hope.
