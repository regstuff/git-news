Enhanced Validation - Checks for missing fields, scores recipe quality, and auto-generates a description.\n\n* Function calling used for structured outputs\n* Cost per recipe: \\~$0.002-0.005\n* Token usage per recipe: \\~1500-1800\n* Volume: Well below GPT-4o free tier (2.5M/day), but still want to optimize for cost/performance\n\n# Problems:\n\n* 5 API calls per recipe = latency + higher cost (Not a concern now, but future proofing)\n* Some prompts feel redundant (maybe combine them?)\n* Haven\u2019t tried parallelism or batching\n* Not sure how to apply caching efficiently\n* Wondering if I can use smaller models for some tasks (e.g. parsing, cuisine detection)\n\n# What I\u2019m Hoping For:\n\n* How to combine prompts effectively (without breaking accuracy)\n* Anyone use parallel/batched API calls for LLM pipelines?\n* Good lighter models for parsing or validation?\n* Any tips on prompt optimization or cost control at scale?\n\nThanks in advance! I\u2019m still learning and would love to hear how others have approached multi-step LLM pipelines and scaling them efficiently.\n\nI know it's not perfect, so go easy on me!!!\n\n# Complete Flow:\n\n    URL (L) \u2192 Raw Data (L) \u2192 Prose Cleaning \u2192 Ingredient Parsing (L) \u2192 Ingredient Categorization \u2192 Cuisine Detection \u2192 Enhanced Validation \u2192 Final Recipe JSON \u2192 Process and push JSON to Firebase (L)\n    (L) = Performed Locally\n\n# Prose Cleaning Prompt\n\n    Remove ONLY marketing language and brand names.\n    PRESERVE descriptive words that add culinary value (tender, crispy, etc.).\n    Do NOT change any ingredients, quantities, or instructions.\n    If no changes needed, return text unchanged.\n    \n    Examples:\n    Input: \"Delicious Homemade Chicken Teriyaki - The Best Recipe Ever!\"\n    Output: \"Homemade Chicken Teriyaki\"\n    \n    Input: \"2 cups flour (King Arthur brand recommended)\"\n    Output: \"2 cups flour\"\n\n# Ingredient Categorization Prompt\n\n    Categorize ingredients with NO modifications.\n    Each ingredient must appear ONCE and ONLY ONCE.\n    If ingredient count mismatches or duplicates exist, return: PRESERVATION_FAILED.\n    \n    Return function call:\n    {\n      main_ingredients: [...],\n      sections: {...},\n      optional_ingredients: [...],\n      input_count: X,\n      output_count: Y,\n      confidence: 0\u2013100\n    }\n\n# Ingredient Parsing Prompt\n\n    Parse recipe ingredients from text.\n    Return a JSON array of ingredient strings.\n    \n    Rules:\n    - Each ingredient is a single string\n    - Include measurements and quantities\n    - Clean extra text/formatting\n    - Preserve ingredient names and amounts\n    - Return valid JSON array only\n\n# Recipe Validation Prompt\n\n    Validate recipe structure.
