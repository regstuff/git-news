General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Friday to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and urge Israel to commit to a Palestinian state, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently opposes.\n\nThe 193-member world body approved a nonbinding resolution endorsing the [\u201cNew York Declaration,\u201d]( which sets out a phased plan to end the nearly 80-year conflict. The vote was 142-10 with 12 abstentions.\n\nHours before the vote, Netanyahu said \u201cthere will be no Palestinian state.\u201d He spoke at the [signing of an agreement]( to expand settlements that will divide the West Bank, which the Palestinians insist must be part of their state, saying, \u201cThis place belongs to us.\u201d\n\nThe resolution was sponsored by [France and Saudi Arabia,]( who co-chaired a high-level conference on implementing a two-state solution in late July, where the declaration was approved.\n\nThe nearly two-year war in Gaza and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict are expected to be at the top of the agenda of world leaders at their annual gathering at the General Assembly starting on Sept. 22. The Palestinians say they hope at least 10 more countries will recognize the state of Palestine, adding to the more than 145 countries that already do.", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/un-assembly-israel-palestinians-two-state-solution-6afa02f5fb4fc8823ac0a6b74d69e2d4", "author": "None"}, {"title": "United States of South Asia", "summary": "Why can\u2019t India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka join together to form USSA?\nWon\u2019t this help both south asia\u2019s global power and economy?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ngeept/united_states_of_south_asia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine can fight Russia for \u2018at least\u2019 another two years, says Kaja Kallas | EU\u2019s foreign policy chief warns \u2018trap\u2019 of territorial concessions would \u2018bring more war, not less\u2019 and should be \u2018off the table\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/09/13/eus-kallas-territorial-concessions-to-russia-would-bring-more-war-not-less/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Who writes the rules of sustainable finance?", "summary": "A machine learning review of 1000 academic papers on sustainable finance found that the field is dominated by US and European authors.
