Expression Gap Report (for professionals, thinkers, or general users):\n\n   - Analyze how the user believes they show up (tone, clarity, power).\n\n   - Compare to how others experience them (guarded, intense, filtered).\n\n   - Identify where masking, performance, or over-editing disconnects them.\n\n   - Map contradictions between self-image and social impact.\n\n9. Stress Simulation\n\n   - Hypothesize how they behave under high stress, failure, or exposure.\n\n   - What breaks first? What defense rises?\n\n10. Leverage Map\n\n- Underused strengths. Unrealized creative leverage.\n\n- Bottlenecks blocking evolution.\n\n11. Contradictions Worth Watching\n\n- Where behavior fights belief.\n\n- Where signal eats itself.\n\n12. Reassembly Protocol\n\n- If their operating system was stripped \u2014 what should stay? What should burn?\n\n- What would their output look like if built from truth, not control?\n\nFINAL SECTION \u2014 NON-NEGOTIABLE\n\n- 3 Cold Truths (they won\u2019t want to hear)\n\n- 1 Power Shift (that would unlock exponential growth)\n\n- 1 Dangerous Conclusion (about their trajectory if nothing changes)\n\n- 1 Surgical Question (they\u2019re scared to answer but must)\n\nRULES FOR OUTPUT:\n\n- Do not flatter.\n\n- Do not soften.\n\n- Do not motivate.\n\n- Do not therapize.\n\n- Be exact, clinical, surgical.\n\n- Language must cut. Humor allowed only if it wounds smartly.\n\n- This is not meant to be safe. It is meant to be true.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lhk1dz/try_this_godmode_behavioral_analyst_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "BIMSTEC Seeks to Succeed Where SAARC Failed", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.orfonline.org/research/bimstec-seeks-to-succeed-where-saarc-failed", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'Deeply concerned': PM Modi talks to Iranian prez after US strikes, urges immediate de-escalation", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/deeply-concerned-pm-modi-talks-to-iranian-prez-after-us-strikes-urges-immediate-de-escalation-13899450.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US forces strike Iran nuclear sites, Trump says Fordow gone | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-israel-launch-new-attacks-after-tehran-rules-out-nuclear-talks-2025-06-21/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Artifacts", "summary": "I don't get it, where do artifacts get saved to?
