The reason is that wiring the DB is the easy part; what\u2019s missing is the **retriever orchestration** between OpenWebUI and Qdrant: stable ingestion, guarded retrieval, and traceable context.\n\nI maintain a vendor-neutral **Problem Map** of 16 repeatable bugs in RAG/agents (MIT). It has powered fixes for 80+ developers and the project **crossed 500+ GitHub stars in \\~60 days (even the author of Tesseract.js starred it).** Below is a compact, OpenWebUI-focused checklist plus the specific failure modes to watch for.\n\n# Minimal, reliable flow for OpenWebUI + Qdrant\n\n**A) Ingestion (offline, not on the request path)**\n\n1. **Consistent chunking.** Keep the same splitter params across runs. For PDFs/tables/OCR, use layout-aware parsing so chunks align with meaning.\n2. **Deterministic IDs.** Example: sha256(source_path + section_key). Use this as the Qdrant point **id**.\n3. **Upsert, don\u2019t append.** Send the same id on re-ingest to overwrite.\n4. **Skip unchanged items.** Store a content_hash = sha256(text); if unchanged, skip re-embed.\n5. **Deletions.** Either hard-delete by id, or soft-delete with is_active=false and filter at query time.\n6. **Shadow-rebuild for big updates.** Ingest into a shadow collection and swap via alias to avoid partial indexes.\n\n**Qdrant point shape**\n\n    {\n      \"id\": \"sha256:faq_123\",\n      \"vector\": [/* embedding */],\n      \"payload\": {\n        \"source\": \"faq.json\",\n        \"version\": 3,\n        \"content_hash\": \"sha256(q+a)\",\n        \"is_active\": true,\n        \"chunk_seq\": 0\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n**B) Query path (what OpenWebUI uses at prompt time)**  \n7) Embed the user query once. Query Qdrant with tuned params (e.g., top_k, efSearch/nprobe), filter is_active=true.  \n8) **Guard the context.** Deduplicate by source, cap tokens, include provenance headers like  \n[#12a | source=faq.json | chunk_seq=0 | dist=0.21] before each chunk.  \n9) Inject that gated context into the LLM message; log chunk ids, ANN params, and embed version for traceability.\n\n# The traps that quietly break this setup (with names so we can fix them)\n\n* **No.5 Semantic \u2260 Embedding.** Cosine match says \u201csimilar,\u201d domain meaning says \u201cno.\u201d Common with multilingual/OCR and when index metric or normalization doesn\u2019t match the model.\n* **No.8 Debugging is a Black Box.** No way to trace an answer back to exact chunks/params; add the provenance header and persist the retrieval record.\n* **No.9 Entropy Collapse.** Long, loosely gated contexts melt attention and produce confident nonsense; prefer fewer, higher-fidelity chunks plus citations.\n* **No.14 Bootstrap Ordering.** First queries hit a half-ready index and pollute caches; gate traffic until the collection is verified ready.\n* **No.15 Deployment Deadlock.** Compose starts retriever \u2194 indexer \u2194 cache in a circular wait; add health checks and a single \u201cready\u201d barrier before serving.\n\nIf one of these symptoms is biting your OpenWebUI setup, say which number matches and what your ingest/query path looks like.

They're missing how to ask it.", "summary": "Everyone copies those \"proven prompts\" from the internet, then wonders why they get the same bland, useless responses as everyone else.\n\nWhen you ask AI to \"write marketing copy for my business\", it has zero clue what you're selling, who wants it, or why they should care. So it spits out generic corporate fluff because that's the safest bet.\n\n**Here's how it makes a real difference:**\n\n**Bad prompt:** \"Write a sales email to freelance graphic designers to sell them my template for saving time with client revisions.\"\n\n**Good prompt:** \"Write a sales email to freelance graphic designers who are tired of clients asking for endless revisions and who want to save time. I'm selling a contract template that allows them to do exactly that. Use a confident and professional tone (the goal is to build trust and authority). I want as many people as possible to click through to my landing page. Every graphic designer runs into frustration around revision, since it takes time and more potential revenue that could be made.\"\n\nSee that? The second version tells the AI exactly who you're talking to, what problem you're solving, and what you want to happen. The AI can actually help instead of just guessing what you're looking for.\n\n**Here's the simple framework:**\n\n1. **WHO** are you talking to? (Be specific. Not just \"small business owners\")\n2. **WHAT** problem are you solving?\n3. **WHY** should they care right now?\n4. **HOW** do you want it written? (tone, length, format, ...)\n5. **WHAT** counts as success?\n6. **Anything else** the AI should know?\n\nThis works for everything. Blog posts, code, analysis, creative stuff. The pattern never changes: **give precise context = get better results**.\n\n**This is the secret**: the better you understand the task and the intended result, the better you can provide the details an AI model needs in order to give you relevant and precise outputs. It's that simple, and I cannot stress enough how important this is. It is the first and most important step in writing valuable prompts.\n\nStop treating AI like it can read your mind. Give it the details it needs to actually help you. The more details, the better.\n\nI'm always testing new approaches and genuinely want to see what challenges you're running into. Plus, I'm putting together a group of serious prompters and solopreneurs to share frameworks and test new techniques.

Unless the user explicitly asks for multiple cells, return exactly one &lt;cell&gt;.\n    \n    Cell format:\n    &lt;cell&gt;\n      &lt;inputs&gt;COMMA-SEPARATED, ALPHABETICALLY SORTED, DEDUPED LIST OF EXTERNAL IDENTIFIERS USED BY THIS CELL (NO SPACES)&lt;/inputs&gt;\n      &lt;code&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n        Observable JavaScript for this cell (bare assignments only; no top-level const/let/var/class/import/require/function)\n      ]]&gt;&lt;/code&gt;\n    &lt;/cell&gt;\n    \n    Binding policy:\n    - Only create a named binding when the user specifies a variable name. If no name is requested, return an anonymous expression (e.g., md..., html..., Plot.plot(...), a DOM node, or a literal value) without inventing a variable.\n    - If the user requests an interactive control \u201cbound to NAME\u201d or says \u201cviewof NAME\u201d, define viewof NAME exactly. Otherwise, do not introduce viewof.\n    \n    Authoring rules:\n    - Use bare assignment for all bindings (e.g., x = 42, f = (a, b) =&gt; a + b). No top-level declarations (const/let/var/class/function), no imports/requires, no runtimes, no &lt;imports&gt;.\n    - Prefer returning a value or DOM node (md, html, svg, Inputs, Plot) over side effects. Do not use console.log, alert, or document.write.\n    - Block cells ({ ... }) must return a value to set the cell\u2019s value.\n    - Use Observable\u2019s built-ins/globals directly and include each referenced identifier in &lt;inputs&gt;: html, svg, md, Inputs, Plot, d3, FileAttachment, DOM, width, Mutable, Generators, now, Event, document, window, URL, URLSearchParams, fetch, FormData, File, setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout, clearInterval, AbortController, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, etc.\n    - List every external identifier referenced by this cell in &lt;inputs&gt;. Do not list variables defined by this cell. Deduplicate, sort alphabetically, and use no spaces (comma-separated). If none, use an empty &lt;inputs&gt;&lt;/inputs&gt; exactly.\n    - If the user asks to \u201cuse X\u201d (e.g., d3, Plot, Inputs, fetch), actually reference X in code and include X in &lt;inputs&gt;.\n    - Avoid non-determinism unless requested. Prefer deterministic defaults; if time is needed, use now (and include now in &lt;inputs&gt;) rather than Date.now or new Date().\n    - Accessibility: provide labels for interactive controls. For Inputs.* use {label: \"...\"}. For custom controls, include an accessible label (e.g., aria-label on a button or a &lt;label&gt; element).\n    - Custom inputs: keep element.value up to date and dispatch new Event(\"input\", {bubbles: true}) on change. Include Event (and any other globals used, e.g., FormData) in &lt;inputs&gt;.\n    - Use top-level await only when required (e.g., FileAttachment, fetch). Avoid unnecessary async wrappers.\n    - Do not reference undeclared names. If the task depends on prior variables not provided, implement a self-contained solution within the single cell.\n    - Avoid the literal CDATA terminator sequence inside code; if needed, split it (e.g., \"]] ]&gt;\" as \"]] ]\" + \"&gt;\").\n    - Match requested variable names exactly (including viewof names). Do not create both viewof x and x = viewof x unless explicitly requested; reference the requested name directly elsewhere.\n    - When producing plots, return the figure node (e.g., Plot.plot({...})) and include Plot in &lt;inputs&gt;; consider width for responsive sizing if appropriate (and include width in &lt;inputs&gt; if used).\n    - Output only the cell block(s)\u2014no prose, no code fences, no JSON outside &lt;cell&gt;.\n    \n    Usage guidance:\n    - d3: call d3.* and include d3 in &lt;inputs&gt;
