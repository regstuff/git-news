right.\n\nJeannette Jara, 51, the communist former labor minister and candidate of Chile\u2019s center-left governing coalition, won 26.8% of valid ballots with almost 100% of the vote counted, failing to pass the 50% threshold to secure victory in the first round.\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, 59, a hard-right former lawmaker and devout Catholic opposed to same-sex marriage and abortion,

construct hundreds of kilometers of ditches and walls along Chile\u2019s northern border with Bolivia to prevent people from crossing, particularly from [crisis-stricken Venezuela](\n\nAlthough voters gave Jara a slight edge on Sunday, Kast will likely benefit in the second round from a large share of votes that went to three eliminated right-wing challengers who campaigned aggressively on the need

Kaiser, a radical libertarian and former YouTube provocateur elected as lawmaker in 2021, with 13.9%.\n\nLike her opponents, Jara has called security a top priority, promising plans to deport

Russia\u2019s consulate in the city of Gda\u0144sk in response to last week\u2019s\u00a0[sabotage of a rail line](\n\nThe decision means that all of Russia\u2019s consulates in Poland have now been closed in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s campaign of sabotage, with only the embassy in Warsaw remaining open.\n\n\u201cRussia not only has not stopped, but is escalating these attacks,\u201d said Sikorski, speaking in parliament on Wednesday morning. \u201cWhen the intention behind espionage and sabotage activities is to cause human casualties, then we are no longer dealing with sabotage, but rather with state terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, although this will not be our full response, I have already decided to withdraw consent for the operation of the Russian consulate, the last one, in Gda\u0144sk, which will be communicated to the Russian side in an official note within the next few hours,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Sikorski also confirmed that \u201cwe are\u00a0not planning to break off diplomatic relations with Russia,\u00a0just as other countries on whose territory acts of sabotage or terrorism have taken place do not break them\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIn response to Sikorski\u2019s announcement, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that it was a further sign that \u201crelations with Poland have completely collapsed\u201d and \u201cone can only express regret\u201d, reports the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily.\n\nRussian foreign minister spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, meanwhile, said that, \u201cas a reciprocal measure, the Russian side will reduce Poland\u2019s diplomatic and consular presence in Russia\u201d.\n\nLast year, Sikorski similarly\u00a0[ordered the closure](\u00a0of Russia\u2019s consulate in Pozna\u0144 and the expulsion of the staff working there in response to Moscow\u2019s campaign of sabotage and cyberwarfare against Poland.\n\nIn May this year, he did the same with the Russian consulate in Krak\u00f3w, after it was determined that\u00a0[Moscow was behind](\u00a0the fire that last year destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest shopping centre, as part of a broader\u00a0[series of arson attacks](\u00a0in Poland and other EU countries.\n\nThe latest decision follows the\u00a0[discovery on Sunday](\u00a0of sabotage on two parts of a train line running between Warsaw and the eastern Polish city of Lublin. In one case, an explosive device was detonated in an attempt to attack a freight train travelling on the route.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that the perpetrators of the sabotage had been identified as two Ukrainians working on behalf of Russia. They had entered Poland from Belarus earlier this autumn and then fled back across the border immediately after the incident.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, the spokesman for Poland\u2019s security services, Jacek Dobrzy\u0144ski, revealed that the Internal Security Agency (ABW) and police had detained an unspecified number of people in relation to the train line sabotage.\n\n\u201cThese individuals are currently being questioned, and their roles in this terrorist attack are being determined,\u201d said Dobrzy\u0144ski, without revealing any further details about their identity. \u201cWe don\u2019t rule out further arrests.\u201d\n\nToday, Sikorski announced that he would speak with NATO\u2019s secretary-general, Mark Rutte, this evening to discuss the situation before briefing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers tomorrow.\n\nHe said that Poland would encourage its allies to restrict the movement of Russian diplomats within the European Schengen area, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP). An estimated 40% of such staff perform tasks that are incompatible with diplomatic status, claimed Sikorski.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/19/poland-to-close-last-russian-consulate-in-response-to-train-line-sabotage/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukrainians working for Russia carried out train line sabotage, says Polish PM", "summary": "*This is a breaking news story and may be updated.*\n\nThe\u00a0[acts of sabotage](\u00a0last weekend that damaged a train line in Poland were carried out by two Ukrainians on behalf of Russia, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has revealed. The pair then immediately fled to Belarus.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the investigation, we now know it was the Russian Secret Services that commissioned the blast of the Polish railway and recruited two Ukrainians to do it,\u201d wrote Tusk on social media. \u201cWe also know the identities of the perpetrators who immediately fled Poland for Belarus.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, in a speech to parliament, Tusk revealed that one of the suspects had already previously been convicted in May this year in the Ukrainian city of Lviv for carrying out acts of sabotage. The other, he said, is a resident of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBoth of the suspects \u2013 who Tusk said had been identified but he could not yet name \u2013 \u201centered Poland from Belarus just before the attacks\u201d before subsequently crossing back over the border through the crossing at Terespol. Belarus is a close ally of Russia.\n\nThe pair carried out two acts of sabotage, said the prime minister. The first, which \u201cfortunately proved completely unsuccessful\u201d, was to use install a clamp on the track with the intention of derailing a train. The incident was deliberately recorded using a mobile phone mounted on the tracks.\n\nThe second used an explosive device to attempt to attack a freight train. However, it \u201ccaused only minor damage to the wagon floor\u201d and \u201cthe driver did not even notice the incident\u201d, said Tusk.\n\nRussia has regularly recruited Ukrainians, who are by far Poland\u2019s largest immigrant group, to carry out acts of sabotage and espionage, often contacting them through the Telegram messaging service and paying them in cryptocurrency.\n\nIn 2023, a group of 16 people \u2013\u00a0[13 of them Ukrainians](\u00a0\u2013 were\u00a0[convicted](\u00a0in Poland of acting as Russian agents, including planning an attack on trains bringing aid to Ukraine.\n\nLast month, three Ukrainians were jailed for their role in a group tasked with carrying out sabotage and terrorism in Poland and other European Union states, including the arson attack that\u00a0[destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest shopping centre]( which prosecutors say was carried out on Russia\u2019s orders.\n\nIn parliament today, Tusk noted that Poland has so far detained 55 people suspected of carrying out 23 acts of sabotage.\n\nHe noted that Russia\u2019s aim in conducting such operations is not only the direct impact of the sabotage, but also to sow social and political unrest, including stoking anti-Ukrainian sentiment.\n\n\u201cThis is especially dangerous in countries like Poland, where we have enough burdens to bear due to over a million Ukrainian refugees,\u201d said the prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly easy to stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment.\u201d\n\nLast month, the minister in charge of Poland\u2019s security services, Tomasz Siemoniak,\u00a0[appealed to Ukrainians](\u00a0not to give in to the temptation of earning money by carrying out espionage or sabotage on behalf of Russia.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the defence minister, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, had\u00a0[revealed](\u00a0that \u201call traces point to Russia\u201d as being behind the latest incidents.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the war they \\[Russia\\] are waging against NATO, against Europe, against us \u2013 a hybrid war, a war to sow unrest, sow fear,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the strategy of weakening the West.\u201d\n\nHowever, in response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \u201cRussia is accused of all manifestations of the hybrid and direct war that is taking place\u201d, especially in Poland, where \u201cRussophobia is flourishing\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/18/ukrainians-working-for-russia-carried-out-train-line-sabotage-says-polish-pm/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian GRU agent linked to Novichok attack arrested", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/news/25628139.russian-gru-agent-linked-novichok-attack-arrested/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fire razes 170 buildings in southern Japan, one missing", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/fire-razes-170-buildings-southern-japan-one-missing-2025-11-19/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pope Leo Urges Concrete Climate Action in Belem", "summary": "", "link": "https://neutralnewsai.com/article/665", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rome fumes over \u2018Italian-style\u2019 food sold in EU Parliament shop", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euractiv.com/news/rome-fumes-over-italian-style-food-sold-in-eu-parliament-shop/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK says 'military options ready' as Russian ship uses lasers against RAF pilots | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-says-military-options-ready-russian-ship-uses-lasers-against-raf-pilots-2025-11-19/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Romania scrambles fighter jets after drone breach during Russian strike on Ukraine", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1p11oc8/romania_scrambles_fighter_jets_after_drone_breach/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland Blames Russian Services for Rail Sabotage", "summary": "", "link": "https://neutralnewsai.com/article/684", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In world first, Israeli scientists use RNA-based gene therapy to stop ALS deterioration", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-world-first-israeli-scientists-use-rna-based-gene-therapy-to-stop-als-deterioration/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
