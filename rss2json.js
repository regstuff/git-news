In this work we demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute) to specific positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens (k) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-k routing mechanism. Since k is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the k tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50% faster to step during post-training sampling.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1c981ru/mixtureofdepths_dynamically_allocating_compute_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Boeing hit with 32 whistleblower claims, as dead worker\u2019s case reviewed", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/19/boeing-subject-of-32-whistleblower-complaints-documents-reveal", "author": "None"}, {"title": " Feature-rich terminal pager ov release v0.34.0", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/noborus/ov/releases/tag/v0.34.0", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Patient had COVID for record 613 days, accumulated over 50 mutations from virus before death", "summary": "", "link": "https://nypost.com/2024/04/19/lifestyle/patient-had-covid-for-record-613-days-accumulated-over-50-mutations-from-virus-before-death/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Appeasing Iran has failed, says exiled crown prince", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/20/iran-prince-diplomacy-appeasement-failing-tougher-west-lead/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A rare 'porcelain gallbladder' has been found in a 100-year-old unmarked grave at a mental asylum cemetery in Mississippi", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/rare-porcelain-gallbladder-found-in-100-year-old-unmarked-grave-at-mississippi-mental-asylum-cemetery", "author": "None"}, {"title": "House of Representatives approves $61 billion in military aid for Ukraine after months of stalling", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/20/us-house-approves-61bn-aid-ukraine", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How new mosquito nets averted 13 million malaria cases", "summary": "", "link": "https://guardian.ng/sunday-magazine/newsfeature/how-new-mosquito-nets-averted-13-million-malaria-cases/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open-source SDK for creating custom code interpreters with any LLM", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/e2b-dev/code-interpreter", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Washington to withdraw from Niger after security pact fails in strategic victory for Russia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/20/us-withdrawal-niger-security-pact-russia", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Horus v1.2.1 Released!
