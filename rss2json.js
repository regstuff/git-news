Yes, Bernard was incredibly good at tripping over just about everything: sidewalks, carpets, small dogs. But these were not simple falls; They were shows! He always managed to fall with an inexplicable grace, like a ballet dancer in full choreography.\n\nOne day, during the big town festival, Bernard decided to go to the market. It was crowded, and sure enough, he tripped over a crate of tomatoes. But this time something special happened. As he fell, he did an involuntary somersault, caught a balloon in the air, and eventually landed in a hot dog stand, where he bounced onto a pile of soft bread.\n\nPeople were amazed. They applauded, thinking it was an artistic performance. Bernard, a little dazed, got up, struck a pose as if he had done it on purpose, and received an ovation. The mayor, impressed by this improvised \"acrobatic\", offered him the opportunity to become the host of the city's shows.\n\nThus, Bernard officially became the \"Master of Faux Pas\", famous for his involuntary stunts, and he even won an award for having \"redefined the art of falling with class\".\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1g1a5xn/bernard_king_of_falls_the_involuntary_art_of_faux/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Textbook recommendations for neural networks, modern machine learning, LLMs", "summary": "I'm a retired physicist working on machine parsing of ancient Greek as a hobby project.
