I'm espcially curious to hear from anyone who's worked on tokenization or multilingual models.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jd91sb/are_compound_words_leading_to_more_efficient_llms/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India tells US to crackdown on anti-India activities of Khalistani terror outfit SFJ: Report", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tells-us-to-crackdown-on-anti-india-activities-of-khalistani-terror-outfit-sfj-report/articleshow/119111830.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NASA's stuck astronauts welcome their newly arrived replacements to the space station", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/nasa-stuck-astronauts-international-space-station-e8e2d188bc4cd1bf36c3c41512d38fcb", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is there a notebook for GRPO with qwen2.5-VL model ?", "summary": "Can I just change parameter of Llama3-GRPO eg. for qwen-2.5 and run it in colab ?
