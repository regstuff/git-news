Now, researchers wonder how this treasure trove of items and currencies from multiple nations and eras made it all the way to the Czech Republic\u2014and why no one ever claimed them.\n\n\nThe coins were likely in Serbia during the 1920s and 1930s, and were often used in typical Balkan necklaces and headdresses. Other coins in the collection come from countries including France, Belgium, Turkey, Romania, Italy, and Russia. However, it\u2019s unclear how they all ultimately made it to eastern Bohemia.\n\nThere are a number of potential theories to explain the treasure\u2019s journey across Europe. One explanation is that the belongings were hidden amid Nazi Germany\u2019s annexation of the region in the 1930s. Following the Munich Agreement of 1938, hundreds of thousands of Jews and Czechs fled further into the country to escape persecution, and it is possible that the cases were buried in hopes of hiding valuables from the invading armies.
