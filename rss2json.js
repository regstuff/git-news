Yes, I know, not very original, and there already is at least one at [ , which is how I learned I could try doing this in OWUI and not in a proxy layer. \n\nLike the one linked, my archutecture will make a retrieval pass on a user prompt.\n\nBut a key design decision in my memory architecture is that the LLM decides what observations to put into memory, instead of extracting it from the interaction using a separate model. Tool calling would let me do it seamlessly - at the cost of another call to the model with the entire context. Which I would like to avoid. So I am planning to instruct the model to add a fixed-format postfix in order to create a memory observation.\n\nThe issue is: I don't want to display that postfix in the chat UI. Of course, I can edit the body in the outlet() function to achieve this. But there is something that bugs me - and I can't find this information anywhere.\n\n*Which versions of the user and assistant messages will remain in the long-term context buffer*? The ChatCompletions API is stateless and the entire previous context is added alongside the new prompt each time a request is sent. \n\nAs far as I could work out (read: as Gemini told me), the messages as they are *after* processing in inlet() and outlet() are added to thos long-term context buffer. **This can be wrong**, If it is wrong, please tell mehow it actually is, and everything after this paragraph in this post is in valid.\n\nIf my understanding is correct, then for assistant messages, when I trim the message appendix in outlet(), it disappears from the context sent to the model in the next call. **Can I avoid this somehow?** Can I keep the message in the context as the assistant sent it, while showing the edited version to the user?\n\nFor user messages, if I prepend/append memories, the prepended/appended content stays in the context for subsequent calls. This is great. My question is: **Will the original version remain in the UI?** Or will inlet() modifying the bnody lead to the UI displaying the modifications?\n\nIf there is another way in which I shiuld be doing this within OWUI, not a filter function, please do tell me.\n\nThe alternative is to do it at the proxy level with LiteLLM and just keep my own context history. It would also allow me to use any other client, not just OWUI. The problem with that approach, however, is that as ChatCompletion calls are stateless, **I don't know which thread I am in**. I can't match my stored context history to the current call, unless I either hash the client-side history (brittle amd CPU-expensive) or add a conversation ID right into the first assistant message (cluttering up the UI). Or is there something here I am not thinking of, which would make \"what thread I am in\" easy to solve?\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1netuym/function_inlet_outlet_keeping_context_for_models/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What prompt do you use for intent for MCP?", "summary": "I use a specialized Microsoft graph API mCP tool that I plug into open web UI and I set it enabled by default.

So it tells the user it doesn't have access to their emails when actually it does have access to their emails just doesn't know it.\n\n\nSo is there a prompt that you all use so AI can gather proper intent from the user and no to use the mCP tool that it has available to itself?
