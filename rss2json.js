One chat may open after a while, but would not process any more queries (thinks forever), another would not even open but just show me an empty chat and the processing icon. Opening a new chat would not help, as it would not respond no matter which model I pick.\nDoes it have to do with the size of the chat? I solved it for now, by exporting my 4 chats, and than deleting them from my server. Then it went back to work as normal. Anything else, including redeployment with image pull, restarting both containers or even restarting the entire server, made no difference. \nThe only thing that changed before it started, is me trying to implement some functions. But I removed them once I noticed the issues. \nAny practical help is welcome. \nThanks!

Now, researchers wonder how this treasure trove of items and currencies from multiple nations and eras made it all the way to the Czech Republic\u2014and why no one ever claimed them.\n\n\nThe coins were likely in Serbia during the 1920s and 1930s, and were often used in typical Balkan necklaces and headdresses. Other coins in the collection come from countries including France, Belgium, Turkey, Romania, Italy, and Russia. However, it\u2019s unclear how they all ultimately made it to eastern Bohemia.\n\nThere are a number of potential theories to explain the treasure\u2019s journey across Europe. One explanation is that the belongings were hidden amid Nazi Germany\u2019s annexation of the region in the 1930s. Following the Munich Agreement of 1938, hundreds of thousands of Jews and Czechs fled further into the country to escape persecution, and it is possible that the cases were buried in hopes of hiding valuables from the invading armies. Another theory dates the stashes to the end of World War II, when Nazis themselves retreated in the face of Russian forces.", "link": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/hikers-discover-nearly-600-gold-coins-dating-back-to-1808/ar-AA1DWFd9?ocid=winp2fptaskbarhover&amp;cvid=765d6c4bb5584f73b92db9bdcb5bb8ca&amp;ei=9", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Wall Street Journal: Tesla\u2019s board began the process to replace Elon Musk as CEO", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/30/business/tesla-board-elon-musk-ceo-search/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Journalist was tortured and had her organs removed in Russian captivity, report says", "summary": "Viktoriia Roshchyna, 27, was captured after she traveled to the Russian-occupied region of Zaporizhzhia in eastern Ukraine, the joint media report said.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia/russia-ukraine-war-journalist-tortured-organs-removed-report-rcna203648", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jupyter code execution is broken: Unexpected token 'I', \"Internal S\"... is not valid JSON", "summary": "This used to work a while ago, but now it throws an error.
