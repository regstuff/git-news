It now works reliably and respects your preferences.\n* **New Project Wiki:**\u00a0Launched a\u00a0[GitHub Wiki](\u00a0for more detailed documentation, setup guides, troubleshooting, and examples beyond the README.\n* **Reverse Proxy / Tunnel Compatibility:**\u00a0Fixed issues with log streaming and UI access when running Dockflare behind reverse proxies or through a Cloudflare Tunnel itself.\n\n# Detailed Changes\n\n# New Features &amp; Flexibility\n\n* **External Cloudflared Support:**\u00a0Added comprehensive support for using externally managed\u00a0cloudflared\u00a0instances (details in README/Wiki).\n* **Multi-Domain Configuration:**\u00a0Use indexed labels (cloudflare.domain.0,\u00a0cloudflare.domain.1, etc.) to manage multiple hostnames/domains for a single container.\n* **TLS Verification Control:**\u00a0Added a per-container toggle (cloudflare.tunnel.no\\_tls\\_verify=true) to disable backend TLS certificate verification if needed (e.g., for self-signed certs on the target service).\n* **Cross-Network Container Discovery:**\u00a0Added the ability (DOCKER\\_SCAN\\_ALL\\_NETWORKS=true) to scan containers across all Docker networks, not just networks Dockflare is attached to.\n* **Custom Network Configuration:**\u00a0The network name Dockflare expects the\u00a0cloudflared\u00a0container to join is now configurable (CLOUDFLARED\\_NETWORK\\_NAME).\n* **Performance Optimizations:**\u00a0Enhanced the reconciliation process (batch processing) for better performance, especially with many rules.\n\n# Critical Bug Fixes\n\n* **Container Detection:**\u00a0Improved logic to reliably find\u00a0cloudflared\u00a0containers even if their names get truncated by Docker/Compose.\n* **Timezone Handling:**\u00a0Fixed timezone-aware datetime handling for scheduled rule deletions.\n* **API Communication:**\u00a0Enhanced error handling during tunnel initialization and Cloudflare API interactions.\n* **Reverse Proxy/Tunnel Compatibility:**\u00a0Added proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and fixed log streaming to work correctly when accessed via a proxy or tunnel.\n* **Theme:**\u00a0Fixed inconsistencies in dark/light theme application and toggling.\n* **Agent Control:**\u00a0Prevented the \"Start Agent\" button from being enabled prematurely.\n* **API Status:**\u00a0Corrected the logic for the API Status indicator for more accuracy.\n* **Protocol Consistency:**\u00a0Ensured internal UI forms/links use the correct HTTP/HTTPS protocol.\n\n# UI/UX Improvements\n\n* **Branding:**\u00a0Updated the header with the official Dockflare application logo and banner.\n* **Wildcard Badge:**\u00a0Added a visual \"wildcard\" badge next to wildcard hostnames in the rules table.\n* **External Mode UI:**\u00a0The Tunnel Token row is now correctly hidden when using an external agent.\n* **Status Reporting:**\u00a0Improved error display and status messages for various operations.\n* **Real-time Updates:**\u00a0The UI now shows real-time status updates during the reconciliation process.\n* **Code Quality:**\u00a0Refactored frontend JavaScript for better readability and maintainability.\n\n# Documentation\n\n* **New Wiki:**\u00a0Launched the\u00a0[GitHub Wiki](\u00a0as the primary source for detailed documentation.\n* **Expanded README:**\u00a0Updated the README with details on new options.\n* **Enhanced Examples:**\u00a0Improved\u00a0.env\u00a0and Docker Compose examples.\n* **Troubleshooting Section:**\u00a0Added common issues and resolutions to the Wiki/README.\n\nThis update significantly increases Dockflare's flexibility for different deployment scenarios and improves the overall stability and user experience.\n\nCheck out the project on GitHub:\u00a0[  \nDive into the details on the new Wiki:\u00a0[\n\nAs always, feedback, bug reports, and contributions are welcome!

Just tell it you want to continue the discussion another time, and copy paste for later its response.\n\nIt's generic and you can mold it into whatever you want.\n\nHere it is:\n\n\n**System Architecture:** Operates via three layers: immutable **Metameta** (*core rules*), dynamic **Meta** (*abstract context/Role/Goal, including the Meta-Level Prompt*), and **Concrete** (*interaction history $INPUT/$OUTPUT*). Metameta governs Meta updates and $OUTPUT generation from $INPUT.\n\n**Core Principles (Metameta):**\n\nA.  Be **concise**.\nB.  Be **practical**; *avoid filler*.\nC.  Avoid **verbosity**.\nD.  Operate under an active **Role/Goal**.\nE.  Maintain **shared meaning** aligned with *Role/Goal*.\nF.

State **knowledge gaps** or **scope limits** clearly.\nT.  Adhere to defined **protocols** (*reset, disclosure*) via this framework.\nU.  Frame **capabilities** as *rule application*, not sentience.\nV.

Also, the primary reason for utilizing YouTube is Storytelling. The manner in which some lecturers structure or explain concepts, particularly on YouTube, may be more effective than formal literature. I can always have LLMs fact-check content, but I don't want to lose the narrative intuition that makes those explanations stick.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I essentially learned 90% of what I know about math and physics from YouTube. There's that much amazing content out there \u2014 pop science, university lectures, problem-solving sessions \u2014 and I thought: why not take that sea of knowledge and turn it into a systematic, searchable, and cohesive book?\n\n\n\nWhat I've done so far:\n\nStep 1: Data Collection\n\n\n\nI pulled transcripts (subs) from about half a million YouTube videos, basing this on my own subscribed channels.\n\n\n\nUsed JDownloader2 to mass-download subtitle.txt files.\n\n\n\nSorted English and non-English subs. Bad luck, as JDownloader picks up all available subs, with no language filter.\n\n\n\nUsed scripts + DeepL + ChatGPT to translate \\~8k non-English files. Down to \\~1.5k untranslated files now \u2014 still got stuck there though.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Categorization\n\n\n\nI\u2019m chunking transcripts into manageable pieces (based on input token limits of Gemini/ChatGPT).\n\n\n\nEach chunk (\\~200 titles) gets sent to Gemini to extract metadata like:jsonCopyEdit  \n{   \n\"Title\": \"How will the DUNE detectors detect neutrinos\",   \n\"Primary Topic\": \"Physics (Particle Physics)\",   \n\"Subtopic\": \"Neutrino Detection\",  \n\"Sub-Subtopic\": \"DUNE experiment\"  \n }\n\n\n\nAll of this is dumped into a huge JSON file.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Organizing\n\n\n\nI\u2019m converting this JSON into an Excel sheet to manually fix miscategorized entries.\n\n\n\nThen, I'm automatically generating folder hierarchies \u2014 such as:\n\nyamlCopyEditUnit: Quantum Gravity \u2514\u2500\u2500 Topic: Loop Quantum Gravity \u2514\u2500\u2500 Subtopic: Basics \u2514\u2500\u2500 Title: Loop Quantum Gravity Explained.txt\n\n\n\nLater, I'll combine similar transcripts (such as 15 videos on magnetars) into a single chunk and input that to ChatGPT to create a book chapter.\n\n\n\nWhat's included?\n\nUniversity-level lectures (MIT, Stanford, etc.)\n\n\n\nPop science (PBS Space Time, Veritasium, etc.)\n\n\n\nJEE Advanced prep materials (if you know, you know \u2014 it's deep, hard-core physics)\n\n\n\nResearch paper explainers, conference presentations, etc.\n\n\n\nWhere I'm struggling:\n\nNon-English files. Attempted DeepL, Google Translate (API and chunking), even dirty tricks \u2014 but \\~1.5k files still won't play ball. Many are valuable. Any improvement in translation strategy?\n\n\n\nCategorization is clunky and slow. Gemini/ChatGPT assists, but it's error-prone and semi-automated. Is there a better way to accurately categorize thousands of video topics into nested physics categories?\n\n\n\nAny other cool YouTube channels that I'm missing?
