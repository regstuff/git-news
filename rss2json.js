You rely on it for critical workflows\u2014whether brainstorming, coding, or analyzing data\u2014and expect premium service in return. Yet, lurking beneath this polished offering is an unsettling reality: OpenAI\u2019s refusal to clearly disclose the exact token limits, combined with the inability to verify usage accurately, creates a black box. Worse, users have no protection against the company quietly degrading the product over time.\n\nThis is not merely a frustration; it raises serious ethical and legal concerns about fairness, transparency, and consumer rights. If you\u2019re a subscriber to OpenAI\u2019s top-tier service, here\u2019s why this issue matters\u2014and why it deserves broader scrutiny.\n\n**The Problem: Undefined and Unverifiable Limits**\n\nAt the heart of OpenAI\u2019s services are token limits, which govern how much input and output text the model can handle in a single interaction or conversation. For example, the number of tokens determines how far back the model can \u201cremember\u201d your conversation or process complex queries. This is critical information for users managing detailed tasks or using the AI for business-critical functions.\n\nHowever, OpenAI does not explicitly disclose the following for its $200/month **o1 pro** tier:\n\n* **Exact Token Limits:** How many tokens can be processed in total (input and output) in one interaction?\n* **Context Window Size:** How far back the model can retain memory within a conversation.\n* **Usage Tracking:** How many tokens you\u2019ve consumed in real time during a session.\n\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s recommended tool for estimating token usage, **tiktoken**, cannot be used to measure token consumption when interacting with the o1 pro model. This creates a fundamental problem: users are flying blind. Without an accurate way to track or verify token usage, subscribers can neither plan effectively nor detect when limits have been quietly reduced.\n\n**Quiet Degradations: The \"Bait and Switch\" Risk**\n\nOne of the most alarming risks of this opacity is the possibility of **silent product downgrades**. Without user awareness, OpenAI could reduce token limits, shorten the context window, or restrict certain functionalities, ostensibly for cost control or infrastructure reasons. Users would have no definitive way to detect these changes, particularly given the lack of token-tracking tools for the o1 pro model.\n\nSuch changes are not just hypothetical. Generative AI services are computationally expensive, and the temptation to reduce operational costs\u2014especially as user demand grows\u2014can lead companies to throttle performance or lower limits. If these changes are rolled out quietly, users paying premium rates are left with a product that no longer meets the original expectations.\n\n**The Ethical Concerns of Lack of Transparency**\n\nThis lack of clarity and control introduces several ethical concerns:\n\n**1. Informed Consent**\n\nSubscribers cannot make informed decisions about whether the service meets their needs without clear disclosures of token limits, usage tracking, and context window sizes. When these details are obscured, users are essentially purchasing a mystery box.\n\n**2. Imbalance of Power**\n\nOpenAI, as the service provider, holds all the control over key variables, including when and how limits might change. Users, meanwhile, are left without recourse to verify claims or ensure consistency in the product they\u2019re paying for.\n\n**3. Erosion of Trust**\n\nTrust between customers and service providers hinges on honesty and clarity. A lack of transparency about critical product specifications undermines that trust, particularly when users feel they\u2019re being short-changed.\n\n**Legal Considerations: Does This Violate Consumer Protection?**\n\nFrom a legal perspective, OpenAI\u2019s approach raises several questions:\n\n**1. Breach of Contract**\n\nIf the product\u2019s capabilities are diminished after purchase\u2014such as reduced token limits or context size\u2014it could constitute a breach of contract. Even if terms of service include vague language allowing for changes, courts may scrutinize whether users were adequately informed.\n\n**2. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices**\n\nFailing to disclose critical product specifications, such as token limits, could be interpreted as a deceptive trade practice under laws like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act in the United States. By marketing a premium product without disclosing limitations, OpenAI may be engaging in misleading advertising.\n\n**3. Implied Warranty of Fitness**\n\nIn many jurisdictions, products are subject to an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. If users subscribe to OpenAI\u2019s top-tier service expecting it to handle complex, lengthy conversations but find that it quietly loses functionality, this could violate those expectations.\n\n**How OpenAI Can Address the Issue**\n\nTo rebuild trust and ensure fairness, OpenAI should take the following steps:\n\n1. **Disclose Token Limits Clearly** Publish exact token limits, context window sizes, and other critical specifications for each subscription tier. This should include how input/output tokens are counted.\n2. **Provide Real-Time Usage Metrics** Introduce a built-in token counter that shows users exactly how many tokens have been consumed during a session.\n3. **Guarantee Stability in Service Levels** Commit to maintaining consistent product specifications (e.g., token limits, context sizes) for paying subscribers and notify users of any planned changes well in advance.\n4. **Offer Usage Tools for o1 Pro** Ensure that tools like **tiktoken** or similar frameworks can accurately estimate token usage for all models, including o1 pro.\n5. **Adopt Clear Terms of Service** Revise terms of service to explicitly define how changes to subscription tiers or limits will be communicated and whether users will be compensated if their subscription quality diminishes.\n\n**Conclusion: A Call for Accountability**\n\nGenerative AI has revolutionized how we work, think, and communicate\u2014but that revolution cannot come at the expense of trust and transparency. For OpenAI\u2019s premium subscribers, the lack of clarity around token limits and the inability to verify usage represents a troubling blind spot in consumer protection.\n\nIf OpenAI is serious about maintaining its leadership in AI innovation, it must take immediate steps to address these concerns. Otherwise, users may rightfully feel that their $200 a month is funding a service that changes quietly behind their backs\u2014leaving them with a product that delivers less than they signed up for.\n\nIn the world of advanced AI, trust is everything. OpenAI should act now to ensure its customers feel confident in what they\u2019re paying for\u2014before legal and ethical challenges force their hand.\n\n\u00a0", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1i4ip1a/why_openais_lack_of_transparency_puts_users_at/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Photograph of 7-year-old Annie and her baby sister Nellie, aged 1 outside their home in Spitalfields.
