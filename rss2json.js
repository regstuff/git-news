However, much prior  interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich  semantic information, suggesting that editing representations might be a  more powerful alternative. Here, we pursue this hypothesis by  developing a family of **Representation Finetuning** (**ReFT**)  methods. ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and learn  task-specific interventions on hidden representations. We define a  strong instance of the ReFT family, **Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT**  (**LoReFT**). LoReFT is a drop-in replacement for existing PEFTs and learns  interventions that are 10x-50x more parameter-efficient than prior  state-of-the-art PEFTs. We showcase LoReFT on eight commonsense  reasoning tasks, four arithmetic reasoning tasks, Alpaca-Eval v1.0, and  GLUE. In all these evaluations, LoReFT delivers the best balance of  efficiency and performance, and almost always outperforms  state-of-the-art PEFTs.
