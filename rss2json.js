I do enjoy programming\u2014I\u2019ve gone over the \u201ctheory\u201d multiple times\u2014but I struggle to remember concepts and apply critical thinking when trying to solve problems. I lack hands-on experience. If you asked me to write even the simplest program, I wouldn\u2019t know where to start.\nI mean, at the exam I couldn\u2019t even figure out, recall,  how to invert a string or how to join 2 dictionaries\u2026 \nI had problems in saving a file  in Visual studio Code on a different laptop.\nI felt so dumb and not suited for this path. \nWhile, most of my  colleagues were just great at programming and did fine at the exam. \n\nIt feels like I\u2019m just memorizing code rather than truly understanding how to use it.\n\nThis whole experience has been pretty discouraging because I know how important programming skills are in this field\u2014especially when there are people with computer science degrees who have been coding since high school.\n\nSo now I don\u2019t know where to start. As I said I\u2019ve read the theory multiple times ( how to join dicyionaries, what are functions and hoe they work etv..) bit then if you put me a concrete problem to solbe, even a very dumb one, i dont knkw where to star5t.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m currently taking an NLP and ML course at university, which requires basic programming knowledge. So I was thinking of following a hands-on NLP course that also covers regex. That way, I could improve my programming skills while reinforcing what I\u2019m studying now.\n\nOr would it be better to start from the basics of Python again maybe going thru tutorials once again and focusing on practice ?
