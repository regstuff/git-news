Don't worry, we reported this incident to the Indian Cyber Crime Department and the actual police must be knocking on their doorstep anytime now.  Please don't send us death threats if you're not ready to go to jail \ud83d\udc94. \n\n\nBan Policy:\n\n* 3-strike system for regular accounts \n* Permanent bans for new accounts which are only created to abuse in the sub .(profund abuse, harassment, etc.)\n\nWhat can you expect from us?\n\n* Fair moderation (no biases, just rules)\n* A community focused on geopolitics, not hate speech\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n* Follow the rules (easy peasy)\n* Report suspicious activity (help us out, we'll dunzo you guys a [Falafel](  :)\n* Engage in constructive discussions (that's what we're here for)\n\nStay civil, stay informed, and let's keep r/GeopoliticsIndia a great place for all!
