I had alot of people around me who loved me yet at the end of the night when i was trying to sleep, something didnt feel alright. I felt incomplete.\n\nThat was when I started delving into the world of spirituality. I started doing meditation, the free youtube vides of Guided meditation. It was fine experience. But nothing groundbreaking.\n\nI stumbled across this Sadhguru video and after some research decided to partake Inner Engineering.\n\nAnd hands down, that was the best decision i'd ever taken. Inner Engineering made me connect to myself. It made me realize what was at the center of universe. I started becoming calmer, my anxiety reduced by alot. And my health improved too. I became fitter and felt lively. Inner Engineering is not to answer your questions, it is to help you understand that the answers to the questions that you seek are just nothing, you realise your questions are meaningless.\n\nI would recommend you all to try this too.
