Please analyze the tone, sentence structure, and personality in these. Then, use that exact style to write \\[whatever thing you need\\].\u201d\n\n**2.

The more you spell it out, the better it gets.\n\n**3. If you're using ChatGPT with memory on, even better.**  \nAsk it to *remember* your style moving forward. You can say:  \n\u201cThis is how I want you to write emails from now on. Keep this as my default writing tone unless I say otherwise.\u201d\n\n**Bonus tip:**  \nIf you\u2019re into prompts, try something like:  \n\u201cAct as if you're me. You\u2019ve read my past emails and know my voice. Based on that, write an email to \\[whoever\\] about \\[topic\\].
