Increasingly though I want to improve the quality of it. I've started to look at finetuning the embedding model itself but truth be told the base model outperformed any tune and picks good matches on proper segments which brings me to my next consideration.\n\nI am now looking at improving the quality segmentation itself which does sometimes lead to poor quality segments that are either very short or seem to break sentences apart (may be a sentence tokenization issue?). \n\nAs my project has accumulated library dependencies over time, I'd like to implement \"local\" improvements (i.e. don't use any more packages that I already have). \n\nAs a side note, I have also built a simple classification NN that spits out the top N topics (in order of likelihood) for a given segment at a fairly good accuracy (trained on 10,000 manual labels) and I feel that this could add some additional quality to defining cut-off points in segmentation?
