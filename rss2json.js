The sites include a significant cluster of five cursus monuments, the largest found in Britain and Ireland, suggesting these structures might have had ritual significance or astronomical alignments with solar events, potentially marking ceremonial routes for ancestral veneration.\n* [Early Humans Spread as Far North as Siberia 400,000 Years Ago](\u00a0\u2014 Archaeological findings in Siberia's Diring Yuriakh site suggest that early humans inhabited this area around 417,000 years ago, a significant adjustment to previous theories. This location now stands as the most ancient site known for early human habitation in such northern latitudes, pushing back the timeline for human migration into Arctic regions by nearly 400,000 years (from 45,000 years ago). The discovery opens up possibilities regarding the paths early humans may have taken into other continents, as well as how long ago humans crossed over to North America.\n\n* [Social Decline and Genetic Diversity of the Y Chromosome](\u00a0\u2014 A study of 20 years\u2019 worth of anthropological data, primarily in Asia, indicated that the significant decline in the genetic diversity of the Y chromosome 3,000-5,000 years ago was not due to men dying in battle as had previously been theorized. The reduced diversity is actually due to societal changes like the emergence of patrilineal social systems. This led to fewer fathers, but more offspring, establishing a \"founder effect\" in genetic terms. Another example is the splitting of clans into subclans. These societal changes profoundly shaped the genetic landscape of modern human populations, pointing to a crucial period where social structures and practices influenced genetic evolution.\n* [Carbonized Herculaneum Papyrus Reveals Burial Place of Plato](\u00a0\u2014 A recent analysis of a carbonized papyrus scroll from Herculaneum, an ancient Roman town, has uncovered significant details about Plato's burial. The scroll, deciphered through modern imaging techniques, contains about 3,000 words, 1,000 of which were readable. It offers insights into Plato's Platonic Academy, his enslavement by the Spartans, and his burial in a private garden near the Museion in Athens.\n* [1,700-Year-Old Roman Ruins Discovered Atop Much Older Neolithic Sacred Spring](\u00a0\u2014 If you\u2019ve been reading the Beat for a while, you know I love the topic of springs. Well, near Limoges, France, archaeologists have discovered Roman ruins from the 3rd century CE, built over a Neolithic sacred spring dating back 4,500 to 6,000 years. From Roman times, the site features a landscaped pool, a protective granite wall, and artifacts including coins and ceramic representations of deities. But the Neolithic is also in the mix thanks to flint offerings, including a dagger fragment. The find highlights the spring's long-term spiritual significance, from Neolithic worship to Roman occupation.\n\nHope you enjoyed this abridged version of\u00a0[Ancient Beat]( Have a great weekend!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1cecwks/this_weeks_archaeological_news_y_chromosomes/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Der Spiegel: a manifesto for the German far-right party AfD was drawn up in the Kremlin", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news/der-spiegel-un-manifesto-per-il-partito-di-estrema-destra-tedesco-afd-fu-redatto-al-cremlino/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India wants a port in Greece \u2013 Lavrio, Patras and Alexandroupoli in focus", "summary": "", "link": "https://greekcitytimes.com/2024/04/26/india-wants-a-port-in-greece/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Generative AI could soon decimate the call center industry, says CEO", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.techspot.com/news/102749-generative-ai-could-soon-decimate-call-center-industry.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lasers reveal prehistoric Irish monuments that may have been 'pathways of the dead'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/lasers-reveal-prehistoric-irish-monuments-that-may-have-been-pathways-for-the-dead", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - evoluteur/healing-frequencies: Play the healing frequencies of various sets of tuning forks: Solfeggio, Organs, Mineral nutrients, Ohm, Chakras, Cosmic octave, Otto, DNA nucleotides... or custom.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/evoluteur/healing-frequencies", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Apple moves closer to China despite supply chain shifts", "summary": "", "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Spotlight/Apple-moves-closer-to-China-despite-supply-chain-shifts", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Traces of hallucinogenic and chili peppers found at a Mayan ballcourt suggest rituals took place there", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-maya-blessed-their-ballcourts-with-ceremonial-offerings", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indian Defence Ministry's Goa Shipyard Limited signs MoU with Netherlands' based Damen Shipyards", "summary": "", "link": "https://thenewsmill.com/2024/04/indian-defence-ministrys-goa-shipyard-limited-signs-mou-with-netherlands-based-damen-shipyards/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Biden administration isn\u2019t fully convinced Ukraine can win, even with new aid", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/biden-ukraine-russia-war-aid-00154143", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey", "summary": "**Paper**: [\n\n**Abstract**:\n\n&gt;Large models represent a groundbreaking advancement in multiple  application fields, enabling remarkable achievements across various  tasks. However, their unprecedented scale comes with significant  computational costs. These models, often consisting of billions of  parameters, require vast amounts of computational resources for  execution. Especially, the expansive scale and computational demands  pose considerable challenges when customizing them for particular  downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platforms constrained  by computational capabilities.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning** (**PEFT**)  provides a practical solution by efficiently adapt the large models over  the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process  of adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it  to a specific task while minimizing the number of additional parameters  introduced or computational resources required. This approach is  particularly important when dealing with large language models with high  parameter counts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be  computationally expensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable  challenges in the supporting system platform design.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In this survey, we  present comprehensive studies of various PEFT algorithms, examining  their performance and computational overhead. Moreover, we provide an  overview of applications developed using different PEFT algorithms and  discuss common techniques employed to mitigate computation costs for  PEFT. In addition to the algorithmic perspective, we overview various  real-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs  associated with different PEFT algorithms. This survey serves as an  indispensable resource for researchers aiming to understand both the  PEFT algorithm and its system implementation, offering detailed insights  into recent advancements and practical applications.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cduqzm/parameterefficient_finetuning_for_large_models_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nigerian airstrike killed 33 villagers during Eid, witnesses say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-airstrike-killed-33-villagers-during-eid-witnesses-say-2024-04-19/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India, Russia companies to manage Sri Lanka's $209 million China-built airport", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/india-russia-companies-to-manage-sri-lankas-209-million-china-built-airport-13764092.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NIA arrests UK resident for 2023 London high commission attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nia-arrests-uk-resident-for-2023-london-high-commission-attack/articleshow/109605143.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany removes restrictions, India can now buy small arms from its firms", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/defence/germany-removes-restrictions-india-can-now-buy-small-arms-from-its-firms/2058123/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for gendered resume datasets", "summary": "For one of my university courses, I have to do a small project on gender bias in models.

In fact, most of them just say something along the line of: \"We've collected a number of resumes\" with no further elaboration about the source of this data.\n\nDoes anyone know of a good dataset for this task?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cdss4l/looking_for_gendered_resume_datasets/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Overwhelming model release rate: Seeking suggestions for building a test set to evaluate LLMs", "summary": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to build my own test set in order to make an initial fast evaluation of the huge number of models that pop up on huggingface.co every week, and I'm searching for a starting point or suggestions.\n\nIf someone would share some questions that they use to test LLM abilities, even as high-level concepts, or simply give me some tips or suggestions, I would really appreciate that!\n\nThanks in advance to everyone for any kind of reply.\"", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cdn7r4/overwhelming_model_release_rate_seeking/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Flooding in Tanzania has killed 155 people as heavy rains continue in Eastern Africa", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/tanzania-flooding-kenya-6332245eba04d8365c457a6c93093d09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "1,430 ancient Roman graves, scattered with funerary festival leftovers, have been discovered in southern France", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/1430-ancient-roman-graves-scattered-with-funerary-festival-leftovers-unearthed-in-southern-france", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists unearth top half of statue of Ramesses II", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-04-archaeologists-unearth-statue-ramesses-ii.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "\u2018Extraordinary\u2019 teenage star scores on debut start as Real Madrid nears La Liga title", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Extraordinary\u2019 teenage star scores on debut start as Real Madrid nears La Liga title</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjcvc3BvcnQvdGVlbmFnZS1zdGFyLXJlYWwtbWFkcmlkLWxhLWxpZ2Etc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDQvMjcvc3BvcnQvdGVlbmFnZS1zdGFyLXJlYWwtbWFkcmlkLWxhLWxpZ2Etc3B0LWludGw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-27", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Liverpool and Feyenoord agree on compensation deal for Arne Slot to become new Reds manager, per reports", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Liverpool and Feyenoord agree on compensation deal for Arne Slot to become new Reds manager, per reports</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjcvc3BvcnQvYXJuZS1zbG90LWxpdmVycG9vbC1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1sP3JlZj11cHN0cmFjdC5jb23SAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA0LzI3L3Nwb3J0L2FybmUtc2xvdC1saXZlcnBvb2wtc3B0LWludGw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-27", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Michael Penix Jr. says he and Kirk Cousins had a \u2018very good conversation\u2019 after surprise draft move to Atlanta Falcons", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Penix Jr. says he and Kirk Cousins had a \u2018very good conversation\u2019 after surprise draft move to Atlanta Falcons</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjcvc3BvcnQvbWljaGFlbC1wZW5peC1qci1raXJrLWNvdXNpbnMtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDQvMjcvc3BvcnQvbWljaGFlbC1wZW5peC1qci1raXJrLWNvdXNpbnMtc3B0LWludGw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-27", "author": "None"}]}}};
