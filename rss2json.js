They identified three influencing factors: Probability of the expected outcome, implicit learning from pre-training, and the number of intermediate steps in reasoning.\r\n\r\n2/ A case study on decoding shift ciphers showed that GPT-4 combines probabilities, memorization, and a kind of \"noisy reasoning.\" The model can transfer what it has learned to new cases and uses two strategies: forward or backward shifting of the letters.\r\n\r\n3/ The explicit output of the intermediate steps in the chain of thought proved to be crucial for the performance of GPT-4. Surprisingly, the correctness of the content of the example chain in the prompt hardly played a role. The researchers conclude that CoT performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic form of genuine reasoning.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1g0hl3q/language_models_use_a_probabilistic_version_of/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Brown corpus download", "summary": "For short, i have a class this year in linguistics and the professor gave us this brown corpus to download to run in antconc, no idea what any if this means.

Lately I've started to learn more about transformer models and I've started to toy around with my own (small) model to (i) create word embeddings and (ii) infer sentence embeddings from those word embeddings. \n\nNaturally I'd be curious to expand that to text segmentation as well but I'm curious to understand how break-off points are defined. Intuitively I'd compute sentence similarity for each new sentence to the previous (block of) sentences and define a cut-off point as of which I'd assume similarity is low enough that it warrants the creation of a new segment. Could that be an approach?
