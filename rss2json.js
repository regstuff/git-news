For opportunities in France for example, directly through campus France I can only apply to 7 programs, from what I've understood so far. So I figured it would be nice to get some info on what I'm getting myself into.\n\nI want to do a masters program with an industry oriented profile, as I don't see myself doing research really. So that rules out some of the CL programs I've seen so far. Going for something related to Generative AI seems the most strategic option when you look at the work market trends, but when I take into account that I have a strong curiosity side for language (and I have a friend who studies linguistics and it seems really cool), it makes me want to go for CL to study some of the stuff I want to know more about.\n\nI guess it would always depends on the program itself, some may be more industry or research oriented, and they may differ on what they teach you. \n\nBut overall, do you have any advice to me?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nyor6y/guidance_on_which_masters_to_pursuelook_for_comp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump's $100,000 H-1B Visa Miscalculation", "summary": "", "link": "https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/09/29/h1b-work-visa-trump-immigration-tech-workers-india-reform/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India moves to internationalise rupee | FT", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/f2a242a9-3cc3-451c-8b53-589926991c2c", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PM Modi hails Trump\u2019s Gaza peace efforts, calls it decisive progress", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-modi-hails-trumps-gaza-peace-efforts-as-hamas-agrees-to-return-israeli-hostages-10286724/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Special' partnership: MEA echoes Putin's sentiments as India-Russia Strategic Partnership completes 25 years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/special-partnership-mea-echoes-putins-sentiments-as-india-russia-strategic-partnership-completes-25-years-11759558299754.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yukon First Nation uses holograms to preserve the knowledge of elders", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-na-cho-ny%D3%93k-dun-first-nation-hologram-project-1.7650021https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-na-cho-ny%D3%93k-dun-first-nation-hologram-project-1.7650021", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India\u2019s push to join the nuclear power club", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ed8f99f-e011-4234-8635-2927433f1961", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Built MCP server + REST API for adaptive memory (derived from owui-adaptive-memory)", "summary": "**Privacy heads-up:** This sends your data to external providers (Pinecone, OpenAI/compatible LLMs).

Problem was I wanted my memories to travel with me - use it in Claude Desktop, namely. Open WebUI's function/tool architecture is great but kinda locked to that platform.\n\n**Full disclosure:** I don't write code. This is Claude (Sonnet 4.5) doing the work. I just pointed it at gramanoid's implementation and said \"make this work outside Open WebUI.\" I also had Claude write most of this post for me. Me no big brain. I promise all replies to your comments will be all me, though.\n\nWhat came out:\n\n**SmartMemory API** \\- Dockerized FastAPI service with REST endpoints\n\n* Same memory logic, different interface\n* OpenAPI spec for easy integration\n* Works with anything that can hit HTTP endpoints\n\n**SmartMemory MCP** \\- Native Windows Python server that plugs into Claude Desktop via stdio\n\n* Local embeddings (sentence-transformers) or API\n* Everything runs in a venv on your machine\n* Config via Claude Desktop JSON\n\nBoth use the same core: LLM extraction, embedding-based deduplication, semantic retrieval.
