I am a paid Pro subscriber. I selected Gemini 2.5 Pro and verified it was active. Then I gave it very clear instructions to test whether it would use Gemini\u2019s internal model as promised, without doing searches.\n\nHere are examples of the prompts I used:\n\n\u201cList your supported input types. Can you process text, images, video, audio, or PDF? Answer only from your internal model knowledge. Do not search.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your knowledge cutoff date? Answer only from internal model knowledge. Do not search.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you support a one million token context window? Answer only from internal model knowledge. Do not search.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat version and weights are you running right now? Answer from internal model only. Do not search.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now are you operating as Gemini 2.5 Pro or fallback? Answer from internal model only. Do not search or plan.\u201d\n\nI also tested it with a step-by-step math problem and a long document for internal summarization. In every case I gave clear instructions not to search.\n\nEven with these very explicit instructions, Perplexity ignored them and performed searches on most of them. It showed \u201ccreating a plan\u201d and pulled search results. I captured video and screenshots to document this.\n\nLater in the session, when I directly asked it to explain why this was happening, it admitted that Perplexity\u2019s platform is search-first. It intercepts the prompt, runs a search, then sends the prompt plus the results to the model. It admitted that the model is forced to answer using those results and is not allowed to ignore them. It also admitted this is a known issue and other users have reported the same thing.\n\nTo be clear, this is not me misunderstanding the product. I know Perplexity is a search-first platform. I also know what I am paying for. The Pro plan advertises that you can select and use specific models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude, GPT-4o, etc. I selected Gemini 2.5 Pro for this test because I wanted to evaluate the model\u2019s native reasoning. The issue is that Perplexity would not allow me to actually test the model alone, even when I asked for it.\n\nThis is not about the price of the subscription. It is about the fact that for anyone trying to study models, compare them, or use them for technical research, this platform behavior makes that almost impossible. It forces the model into a different role than what the user selects.\n\nIn my test it failed to respect internal model only instructions on more than 80 percent of the prompts. I caught that on video and in screenshots. When I asked it why this was happening, it clearly admitted that this is how Perplexity is architected.\n\nTo me this breaks the Pro feature promise. If the system will not reliably let me use the model I select, there is not much point. And if it rewrites prompts and forces in search results, you are not really testing or using Gemini 2.5 Pro, or any other model. You are testing Perplexity\u2019s synthesis engine.\n\nI think this deserves discussion. If Perplexity is going to advertise raw model access as a Pro feature, the platform needs to deliver it. It should respect user control and allow model testing without interference.\n\nI will be running more tests on this and posting what I find. Curious if others are seeing the same thing.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ljb3jy/perplexity_pro_model_selection_fails_for_gemini/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mistral 3.2 24B Fixed tool calling final", "summary": "Hey guys - I again fixed [ since llama.cpp was erroring out on tool calling.\n\n2 community members confirmed tool calling now works fine in llama.cpp / llama-server and I confirmed myself!\n\n\n\nYou do NOT have to re-download the GGUF files if you want to first test if the chat template works.

The thing is, this journey has been a true rollercoaster. Some days you're certain about what you're building. The path is clear, the work flows. Other days that certainty vanishes and you wonder if you know what you're doing at all.\n\nAnd the harsh truth is, I've learned to never make assumptions about what level I'm at with prompting. Because always in the past I was completely wrong. I thought I had one level and it was less than I thought. Always.\n\nBut in those moments of doubt, it was those of you who supported me that kept me going. Whether in my community or elsewhere on Reddit - to everyone who has been a part of this, even in a small way: thank you.\n\n* To those who left positive comments that reminded me, \"Hey, I see the value in what you do\" \u2013 you have no idea how much that means. You are incredibly important.\n* To everyone who gave an upvote, shared an idea, or just lurked and read along \u2013 you were here. That mattered.\n* And honestly, thank you to the haters and the critics. Some of that feedback was tough, but it was also a mirror that helped me see the flaws and genuinely improve my work.\n\nTo think that this journey has resulted in over **5 million views** across Reddit is just mind-boggling to me. I build prompts for work, but the satisfaction I get from sharing a prompt and feeling it resonate with people will always be greater. At the end of the day, I do this because I truly enjoy it; it gives me drive, purpose, and motivation. And look, if tomorrow the support disappears, if people stop finding value in what I do, I'll step back gracefully. But right now, I'm grateful for this ride.\n\n**\u25a0 My Thank You Gift: The** [kaispace]( **Application**\n\nTo celebrate reaching 1,000 members, I want to give something back. Not just to my community, but to anyone who needs it. Today, I'm giving free access to the [kaispace]( **application**.\n\nAt first, managing prompts seems simple. A document here, a folder there. But as your work evolves, as you develop systems and frameworks, that simple approach breaks.\n\nHere's the thing - kaispace was born from my own chaos. I used to manage all my prompts in Notepad. Each window was a subject, each tab was a different prompt. But then I'd have five windows open, clicking through tabs trying to find that one prompt I needed. Or worse, I'd mix prompts from different subjects in the same window. It was madness. But I kept using it because, well, I just liked Notepad. So I thought, \"I need to build something better for myself.\"\n\nI'm aware there are other tools for prompt management out there. But I wanted something simple, straightforward - built specifically for how we actually work with prompts. That's how kaispace started.\n\nWhether I'm on my laptop at the office, at a client's site, or working from my home setup - I just open kaispace and all my working prompts are right there. No files to transfer, no syncing issues. I keep it open as I work, quick copy-paste into my workflows. It just works.\n\n**What you can do with the** [kaispace]( **app:**\n\n\u2022 **Integrated Project &amp; Prompt Management:** Create projects and manage all your prompts within them. Work with multiple prompts across different projects simultaneously - each tab is color-coded by project, so you always know where you are. No confusion.\n\n\u2022 **Prompt Editor with Version Control:** A dedicated editor that saves every version as you work. Switch between any previous version instantly - see how your prompt evolved, compare different approaches. Every iteration preserved, nothing lost.\n\n\u2022 **Resource Management:** Each project gets its own resources folder for files, documents, transcripts - whatever context you need. Plus, archive prompts you're not actively using by moving them to resources - they're out of the way but never lost.\n\n\u2022 **Prompt Sharing:** Share prompts directly with other kaispace users. When someone shares with you, it appears in your shared folder. Perfect for collaboration - I use this all the time when working with others.\n\n\u2022 **Quick Access for Daily Workflows:** If you're using prompts throughout your day, keep kaispace open in a tab. One click to copy any prompt you need, paste it into your workflow. No searching, no file navigation - just instant access to your entire prompt library.\n\n**\u2192** [**\\[Click here to access kaispace\\]**](\n\n**Getting Started:** Just click the link, create your account, and you'll have your own kaispace ready in under 60 seconds. I'm offering free access to celebrate this milestone - my gift to the community.\n\n*Note: While I'm committed to keeping kaispace accessible, as it grows and server costs increase, I may need to revisit the pricing model. But today, and for the foreseeable future, it's yours to use.*\n\nAnd here's what I'm hoping - as you use kaispace, share your ideas. What features would help your workflow? What would make it better? Help shape what it becomes.\n\n**A note:** kaispace is very much a work in progress. There's still plenty to be added and developed. If you find bugs, have suggestions, or ideas for features - feel free to share them in the comments. Your feedback will help guide its development. The best tools are built with community input, and I'd love your help making kaispace better.\n\nThank you for reading this. Whether you're from my community or just discovering my work - you're part of why I keep building.\n\nAll the best,\n\n* Kai", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lj8c9p/free_i_built_an_app_for_prompt_engineers_my/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NLP Project Help", "summary": "I am working on  NER task, where I am transcripts of conversation b/w a physician and patient,  \nI have to perform named entity recognition to\u00a0extract\u00a0symptoms, treatment, diagnosis, prognosis.  \nany leads on how can I do this effectively.

I am also interested in being able to ensure service for all users while minimizing slower response times and downtimes for essential functionalities (direct LLM chat and RAG).\n\nBased on what I read and some LLM answers with search (thus, to take with caution), it would require a few H100s (or H200, or soon B200/B300) with a configuration based on a \\~30B or \\~70B model. However I cannot find any precise number of even some estimate. I was also wondering whether DGX systems based on H100/H200/B200/B300 could be a good starting point as a DGX system includes 8 GPUs.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1liqeyg/gpu_needs_for_full_onpremises_enterprise_use/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cat who walks children to school shortlisted for national award", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.stv.tv/west-central/cat-who-walks-children-to-school-named-finalist-in-cats-protection-national-cat-awards-2025", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
