Quality\n\n   The most important aspect is how natural the generated speech sounds. For pronunciation practice, the naturalness of the speech is paramount.\n\n   OpenAI's TTS has been excellent in this regard, providing clear and consistent word articulation.\n\n   While [Eleven Labs]( has speech that's full of emotion, it's [pricier]( and isn't necessarily better for pronunciation practice.\n\n   I don't rely on quality scores for TTS APIs; the proof is in putting the words together.\n\n1. Latency\n\n   OpenAI's TTS API typically processes a sentence in about 0.5 seconds, which is decent. But there's room for improvement.\n\n1. Cost\n\n   I want to keep my total monthly cost under $100.\n\n   I prefer a pay-as-you-go model instead of a fixed-cost one with a usage cap.\n\n   For my pronunciation practice, I'm looking at using it for up to 30 hours each month. I use [Deepgram]( for speech-to-text, which runs me [$0.0043 per minute]( and needs two API calls for each pronunciation. Here's a quick cost breakdown:\n\n   - Deepgram costs: 30 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour \u00d7 2 calls \u00d7 $0.0043 per minute = $15.48\n\n   - Remaining budget for TTS: $100 - $15.48 = $84.52\n\nThis project is all about instant feedback on pronunciation. You can check out [the details]( to understand why these factors are crucial.\n\nSo, if you know of a TTS API that beats OpenAI's in at least one of these areas while matching it in the others, hit me up!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cz6hk4/seeking_superior_texttospeech_api_alternatives_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - psyb0t/docker-openvpn-client: Welcome to the most badass OpenVPN Client Docker image you'll ever see.

It can't offer infrastructure or large-scale economic aid. Theoretically, it could leverage its market to support India, but this doesn't align with economic principles or the profit motives of American businesses. East Asia, Southeast Asia, and even Mexico are far better suited as sources for American imports. Going against economic principles and profit motives isn't typical for the USA and would require a strong, consistent policy execution, which is unrealistic for American politics.\n\n2. **Military Assistance**: The USA lacks the capability to militarily rescue India. In case of a prolonged war between India and China, the USA could indeed distract China. However, the most likely scenario is a short, intense conflict at the border. In such a situation, American military intervention would be minimal. Think about it: what can the USA really do? Attack mainland China? Send troops to the India-China border? Providing some intelligence and weapons is possible, but the conflict might end before the weapons are even used. And if the USA gives substantial support and India still loses (which is quite possible), it would tarnish the credibility of American military aid and weapon sales globally.\n\n3. **Independence and Equality**: India values its independence highly, while the USA struggles to accept equal partnerships. This deep-rooted American mindset is hard to change without significant setbacks. Paradoxically, if the USA could truly treat India as an equal, China might actually welcome it. Although it would increase pressure on China, the shift in the American mindset would be more significant. If the USA accepts India as an equal, could accepting China's superiority be far behind?\n\n4. **Timing**: It's too late for the USA to ally with India effectively. Currently, India's ability to drain China's economic and political resources is too weak. Compare this to China's impact on the Soviet Union from the late '60s to the '80s (e.g., the Zhenbao Island conflict, Soviet troops in the Far East and Mongolia, ideological battles, guerrilla warfare in Africa, the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Soviet-Afghan War, etc.). Even if India rises to powerfully counter China, it will take years. Meanwhile, the USA is already being surpassed by China and is facing severe political and economic crises. A costly alliance that doesn't address America's immediate problems is hard to justify.\n\n5. **Long-term Consequences**: If India rises strongly, the USA will drop to the third global rank, with the East fully eclipsing the West. Even if the USA supports India for a while, it will become clear that China's economic strength far surpasses the USA's before India can catch up to China. Thus, India would have to surpass the USA first to effectively counter China. The USA might suffer the pain of becoming number three without reaping the benefits of a major China-India showdown. How would the USA handle that?\n\n6. **China's Future Debates**: In the 2030s, China might have a major debate on whether to prioritize dealing with the USA or India. While officially this might be avoided, popular opinion could influence government attitudes. If a consensus forms to target one, the scenario could shift in that direction by the mid-2030s. Even if it doesn't, the 2050s might see another push. Each generation wants to achieve something significant, and by the 2030s or 2050s, the Chinese public might feel that the \"great rejuvenation\" is complete and seek new goals. Historically, being a long-term target of China is daunting. (I'll write more on this later.)\n\n   A bizarre situation could arise: in the 2030s, the country (the USA or India) with more troubles and weaker economic performance might actually be safer from China's focus in the long term.\n\nIn short, Indian and American strategists might soon realize the huge risk of being China's primary target. Both sides would prefer the other to be targeted while they reap the benefits. This mindset makes forming a solid alliance difficult. China's decision-making and execution capabilities allow it to adopt a strategy of \"targeting one while letting the other benefit,\" making it hard for the targeted country to maintain an alliance with the beneficiary.\n\n7. **Potential for Change**: Of course, if China acts irrationally, it could force a strong, stable US-India alliance. This is similar to how American strategists often list reasons why a long-term Sino-Russian alliance is unlikely, yet poor US policies have pushed China and Russia closer over the past 30 years. However, there's a difference: the USA has almost no chance of winning against a Sino-Russian quasi-alliance due to its smaller scale.
