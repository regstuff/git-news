But the group delayed executing the plan as it tried to persuade Iran and Hezbollah to participate. Mr. Sinwar hoped a regional conflagration would cause Israel to \u201ccollapse.\u201d\n\n* As they prepared arguments aimed at Hezbollah, the Hamas leaders said that Israel\u2019s \u201cinternal situation\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to turmoil over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s contentious plans to overhaul the judiciary \u2014 was among the reasons they were \u201ccompelled to move toward a strategic battle.\u201d\n\n* In July 2023, Hamas dispatched a top official to Lebanon, where he met with a senior Iranian commander and requested help with striking sensitive sites at the start of the assault.\n\n* The senior Iranian commander told Hamas that Iran and Hezbollah were supportive in principle, but needed more time to prepare; the minutes do not say how detailed a plan was presented by Hamas to its allies.\n\n* The documents also say that Hamas planned to discuss the attack in more detail at a subsequent meeting with Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s leader at the time, but do not clarify whether the discussion happened.\n\n* Hamas felt assured of its allies\u2019 general support, but concluded it might need to go ahead without their full involvement \u2014 in part to stop Israel from deploying an advanced [new air-defense system]( before the assault took place.\n\n* The decision to attack was also influenced by Hamas\u2019s desire to disrupt [efforts to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia]( the entrenchment of Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank and Israeli efforts to exert greater control over the Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem, sacred in both Islam and Judaism and known to Jews as the Temple Mount.\n\n* Hamas deliberately avoided major confrontations with Israel for two years from 2021, in order to maximize the surprise of the Oct. 7 attack. As the leaders saw it, they \u201cmust keep the enemy convinced that Hamas in Gaza wants calm.\u201d\n\n* Hamas leaders in Gaza said they briefed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s Qatar-based political leader, on \u201cthe big project.\u201d It was not previously known whether Mr. Haniyeh, who [was assassinated by Israel in July]( had been briefed on the attack before it happened.\n\n[Read a copy of the rest of the article here](", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-war.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spain is betting on immigrants to boost its economy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/spain-is-betting-on-immigrants-to-boost-its-economy-2024-10", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fifth peacekeeper wounded in southern Lebanon, UN says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy92zjq508o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK Ambulance Services targeted by Kremlin-protected Russian hackers", "summary": "", "link": "https://inews.co.uk/news/uk-ambulance-services-targeted-hackers-russia-kremlin-3317208", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Juiciest Substring", "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m a novice thinking about a problem. \n\nAssumption: I can replace any substring with a single character.
