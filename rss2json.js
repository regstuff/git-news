They had hoped to compete in the Four Hills Tournament currently taking place in Austria and Germany, but did not receive visas in time.\n\nThe next major ski jumping event is being held on 11 January at the famous Wielka Krokiew hill in the mountain resort town of Zakopane in southern Poland. It is one of the last chances to qualify for the Olympics, which begin in Italy on 6 February.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Friday issued to Polskie Radio, the Polish foreign ministry confirmed that there is no chance of the Russian athletes being allowed to take part.\n\nIt pointed to the fact that, since September 2022,\u00a0[restrictions have been in place](\u00a0on the entry of Russians to Poland. \u201cDue to the impossibility of crossing the border, there are no grounds for accepting a visa application,\u201d wrote the ministry.\n\nLast month, after CAS issued its ruling, Poland\u2019s sports minister, Jakub Rutnicki, said that \u201cthe idea of a Russian competing in Zakopane is non-existent\u201d and there would be \u201cno discussion\u201d of it.\n\n\u201cThe Russian national team, even under a neutral flag, should not participate,\u201d said Rutnicki. \u201cGiven what is happening beyond our eastern border, and also within the territory of Poland, we cannot imagine that the Russians could participate in any form.\u201d\n\nPoland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s closest allies since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. It has also itself suffered from a series of \u201chybrid actions\u201d carried out by Russian operatives, including\u00a0[sabotage](\u00a0[cyberattacks](\u00a0and\u00a0[disinformation campaigns](\n\nIn 2023, a Russian speed skater, Vladimir Semirunniy, fled to Poland, where he was\u00a0[allowed to compete for the Polish national team](\u00a0after declaring his opposition to the war in Ukraine.

It doesn\u2019t matter whether the victims are Ukrainians, Jews, Roma or Polish citizens who hold different views.\u201d\n\nUnder Polish law, inciting hatred based on national, ethnic, racial or religious differences or publicly insulting someone based on such differences are crimes punishable by up to three years in prison.\n\n[Police data](\u00a0show that, from the start of January to the end of July in 2025, 543 bias-motivated crimes were recorded in Poland. That was a 41% increase on the 384 such crimes reported in the same period of 2024.\n\n\u201cRaising awareness of diversity in its dimensions, including race, ethnicity and religion, as well as preventing and combating bias-motivated crimes, is a key element of the Polish police\u2019s operations,\u201d wrote the police at the time.\n\nData for the rest of 2025 are not yet available, but the figures from the first seven months of the year suggest that Poland was on track to have one of the highest annual numbers of reported hate crimes on record.\n\nOne community that has complained of growing hate is Ukrainians, who are by far the largest immigrant group in Poland, numbering around 1.5 million.\n\nLast month, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister\u00a0[called on Poland](\u00a0to impose \u201cfair and exemplary\u201d punishment on those who engage in xenophobic behaviour towards Ukrainians, following reports that a Ukrainian schoolgirl was subjected to abuse at a Warsaw school.\n\nIn December, \u017burek met at the justice ministry with Ukraine\u2019s ambassador, Vasyl Bodnar, and the president of the Ukrainian World Congress, Paul Grod, to discuss combating hate speech and disinformation, which have been stoked in Poland by Russian operatives.\n\nAt the meeting, \u017burek \u201creaffirmed Poland\u2019s commitment to supporting Ukrainian citizens\u201d and said that his ministry would develop new legal regulations and prosecutorial competences in combating hate crimes.\n\nAccording to OKO.pres, \u017burek\u2019s plans will see special hate-crime units set up at 11 district prosecutor\u2019s offices in cities around Poland as well as at four in Warsaw. Maciej M\u0142ynarczyk, a prosecutor who specialises in hate-speech cases, is expected to play a central role in the new system.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s failure to effectively respond to aggression motivated by nationality, religion, skin colour or sexual orientation harms society as a whole,\u201d M\u0142ynarczyk told OKO.press. \u201cIt increases tolerance for violence, reduces respect for the law, undermines social stability, and undermines national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state and society cannot afford to be defenceless in this area,\u201d he continued. \u201cA comprehensive solution is necessary: dedicated training and exchange of experience, a methodological manual, and a distribution of workload so that specialised prosecutors handle such cases frequently and quickly gain experience.\u201d\n\nLast year, the government also sought to expand Poland\u2019s hate crime laws so that they also include sexual orientation, sex/gender, age and disability as protected categories.\n\nHowever, then-President Andrzej Duda, who was aligned with the conservative opposition,\u00a0[refused to sign the measures into law](\u00a0and instead sent them to the Constitutional Tribunal (TK) for review. The TK, which is also aligned with the opposition, deemed the bill unconstitutional, thereby preventing it from coming into force.\n\nLast year also saw a dramatic rise in the visibility and popularity of radical-right leader Grzegorz Braun, whose political activity has centred around anti-Jewish, anti-Ukrainian and anti-LGBT rhetoric.\u00a0He\u00a0[finished a surprise fourth](\u00a0in the 2025 presidential election and his party has\u00a0[growing support](\u00a0in polls.\n\nIn December, Braun\u00a0[went on trial](\u00a0for his 2023 attack on a Jewish religious celebration in Poland\u2019s parliament.
