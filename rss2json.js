Now prosecutors also wish to charge him under a law that makes it a criminal offence to \u201cpublicly and contrary to the facts deny\u201d Nazi or communist crimes.\n\n\u201cThere is and will be no consent to distorting history and breaking the law,\u201d wrote justice minister Waldemar \u017burek, announcing on Friday that he had asked the European Parliament to lift Braun\u2019s immunity.\n\n\u201cThis is a question of historical truth, respect for the victims, and accountability for one\u2019s words,\u201d added \u017burek, who also serves as prosecutor general. \u201cThe Polish state has a duty to respond to the denial of Nazi-German crimes.\u201d\n\n\u017burek revealed that the accusation against Braun relates to \u201cdenial of genocide crimes committed by functionaries of the Third Reich in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and the Lublin concentration camp (Majdanek)\u201d.\n\nIn a further statement, Poland\u2019s Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), a state historical body that has prosecutorial power, said that the accusation related to the use of gas chambers at those two camps.\n\nNeither the IPN nor \u017burek confirmed what specific words Braun had said that prompted the planned charges against him. However, the IPN noted that they had come at a live event broadcast online on 27 September 2025.\n\nOn that date, Braun took part in a discussion with Jan \u017baryn, a right-wing historian and former senator for the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, titled \u201cThe Polish Underground State and the Jewish Issue\u201d. A\u00a0recording of the event is still available online.\n\nDuring his remarks, Braun referred to the \u201cfake gas chambers of Majdanek and Auschwitz\u201d, calling them \u201ca dark, monstrous fantasy that has no satisfactory historical or academic support\u201d.\n\nHe suggested that the idea of the gas chambers had been invented as part of \u201cpropaganda and black PR operations conducted by the Soviet and Anglo-Saxon security services during World War Two\u201d, and that the false claim continues to be exploited by Jews today.\n\nIn actual fact, historians estimate that around 900,000 people were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. The vast majority were Jews, but victims also included Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and ethnic Poles.\n\nMeanwhile, gas chambers at Majdanek were used to kill tens of thousands, again mainly Jews. Today, the ashes of the camp\u2019s cremated victims are preserved in a memorial at the site of the former camp.\n\nBraun, who has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, has repeatedly sought to cast doubt on the veracity of Nazi crimes against Jews.\n\nIn a separate interview in July last year, he also\u00a0[called](\u00a0the gas chambers at Auschwitz \u201cfake\u201d. In response, \u017burek\u00a0[filed a similar request](\u00a0to lift Braun\u2019s immunity so that he could face charges for denying Nazi crimes.\n\nThe European Parliament \u2013 which can strip an MEP\u2019s immunity by a majority vote among their fellow MEPs \u2013 is still processing that request.\n\nIn December, Braun\u00a0[went on trial](\u00a0over a separate set of charges relating to four other incidents, including his\u00a0[attack](\u00a0on a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah in parliament in December 2023 and his\u00a0[disruption of a lecture](\u00a0by a Holocaust scholar.\n\n\u201cI am standing before this court because I dared to defend myself against oppression and the ritual manifestation of Jewish supremacy,\u201d declared Braun at the start of the trial.\n\nIn November, the European Parliament\u00a0[also stripped Braun of immunity](\u00a0to face charges for six alleged crimes, including inciting religious hatred against Jews, assaulting a doctor involved in carrying out a late-term abortion, and\u00a0[vandalising](\u00a0an LGBT+ exhibition.\n\nAmid his legal troubles, Braun has seen his popularity rise. When he stood as a candidate in last year\u2019s presidential election, he began as a rank outsider but ended up\u00a0[finishing fourth]( with 6.3% of the vote, following a campaign characterised by antisemitic, anti-Ukrainian and anti-LGBT+ rhetoric.\n\nMeanwhile, the radical-right party that he leads, Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP), has\u00a0[surged in the polls]( where it now averages support of around 8%.\n\n[**Daniel Tilles**](\n\nDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0*Notes from Poland*.

The opposition has urged him to do the latter, as they claim the funds\u00a0will bring Poland under greater control by Brussels.\n\nThe government insists SAFE will benefit Poland, providing a major boost to national security and the domestic defence industry. It says that, if Nawrocki vetoes the bill, the funds can still be accessed, but that the process will be more complicated and it may not be possible to spend all the money.\n\nThe Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, earlier this month\u00a0[approved](\u00a0an initial version of the bill, which sets up a mechanism for Poland\u2019s National Development Bank (BGK) to receive and disburse the SAFE funds.\n\nThe bill then\u00a0[went](\u00a0to the upper-house Senate, which introduced amendments that the ruling coalition said were intended to assuage opposition concerns regarding SAFE. Those changes were today accepted by the Sejm, meaning the bill passes to the president for final approval.\n\nThe amendments include a provision for expenses relating to repayment and servicing of the loans to be covered by a specially created reserve rather than counting towards defence spending limits. Another change requires Poland\u2019s security agencies to conduct anti-corruption and counterintelligence oversight of the funds.\n\nHowever, amendments proposed by the opposition were rejected by the Senate, reports news website OKO.press. They included a measure intended to thwart the EU\u2019s ability to withhold the funds through its so-called conditionality mechanism, which the opposition says gives Brussels too much leverage over national affairs.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Nawrocki echoed those concerns. Although Poland\u2019s army needs the funds, \u201cdoubts arise from the programme\u2019s sovereignty aspect\u201d, he said. \u201cWe need to be sure that these funds will not be withheld or suspended \\[by the EU\\].\u201d\n\nPiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski has even argued that the attempt to bring defence spending under greater control by Brussels, and the fact that funds can be withheld, will be used to bring Poland \u201cunder German rule\u201d.\n\nPiS and the president\u2019s chancellery have also warned that, because the majority of SAFE funds must be spent in Europe, Poland\u2019s participation could damage its relations with the United States, a key security partner and military hardware supplier.\n\nNow that the bill has been approved by\u00a0parliament, the president has 21 days to decide whether to sign it into law, veto it, or send it to the constitutional court for assessment.\n\nThe government has urged him to approve the measures, saying that they are vital for national security and also will provide a major boost to Poland\u2019s domestic defence industry because almost 90% of the money will be spent at home.\n\nIt also says that the loans are on favourable terms, with interest rates almost half of those taken by the former PiS government from South Korea to purchase\u00a0[Korean military gear.](\n\nPiS and Nawrocki have, however, questioned those figures, arguing that the government has shown a lack of transparency regarding the terms of the loans and where and how the money will be spent.\n\nEarlier this week, the government\u2019s plenipotentiary for SAFE, Magdalena Sobkowiak-Czarnecka, told newspaper\u00a0*Puls Biznesu*\u00a0that they have a contingency plan prepared in the event that Nawrocki vetoes the bill.\n\nShe said that, although the funds would still arrive, \u201cit will be difficult to use their full potential\u201d, in particular for spending outside the defence sector. For example, around \u20ac2 billion is meant to go to the interior ministry for spending on the police, border guard and security services, as well as for infrastructure.\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of 11 leading Polish defence firms, including the state-owned Polish Armament Group (PGZ), signed a joint statement in support of SAFE.\n\nThey called the programme a \u201chuge opportunity for the Polish defence industry\u201d, implementation of which would result in \u201ca radical increase in defence production\u201d, creating jobs and bringing more tax revenue for the state.\n\n[**Olivier Sorgho**](\n\nOlivier Sorgho is senior editor at Notes from Poland, covering politics, business and society.
