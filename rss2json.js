Like Anthropic would already tell Claude how to respond to your request. So I'm not convinced that re-using some made some prompt template you came up with is better than crafting a simple prompt on the fly for whatever I'm trying to do, or just simply meta-prompting and starting a new conversation. Literally, just tell the agent to meta-prompt and start a new conversation.  \n\nIMO prompt engineering has to have some way of actually measuring results. Like suppose I want to measure how well a prompt solves coding problems. I would need at least a few thousand coding problems to benchmark. To measure and find the best prompt. And it needs to be at a scale that proves statiscal significance across whatever kind of task the prompt is for.  \n\nAnd ultimately, what are you actually trying to achieve? To get more correct answers with fewer tokens? To get better results regardless of token count?  \n\nJust to give you a specific example, I want Claude to stop calling everything sophisticated. I'm so sick of that word dude! But I'm not convinced telling Claude not to say sophisticated is a good idea because it's going to distract Claude from the coding task I'm giving it. But me just telling Claude things isn't prompt engineering.

The tool assumes it's operating in a potentially untrusted environment and gives you the power to verify its behavior and lock down its capabilities.\n\n\n\n1. Verifiable Zero-Egress\n\nWe claim the tool is air-gapped, but you shouldn't have to take our word for it.\n\nHow it works: At startup, the CLI can monkey-patch Node.js's http and https modules. Any outbound request is intercepted. If the destination isn't on an explicit allowlist (e.g., localhost for a local vector server), the request is blocked, and the process exits with a non-zero status code.\n\nHow to verify: Run agm prove-offline. This command attempts to make a DNS lookup to a public resolver. It will fail and print a confirmation that the network guard is active. This allows you to confirm at any time that no data is leaving your machine.\n\n2. Supply Chain Integrity for Shared Context: The .agmctx Bundle\n\nWhen you share context with a colleague, you need to be sure it hasn't been tampered with. The .agmctx bundle format is designed for this.\n\n\n\nWhen you run agm export-context --sign --zip:\n\n\n\nChecksums First: A checksums.json file is created, containing the SHA-256 hash of every file in the export (the manifest, the vector map, etc.).\n\nCryptographic Signature: An Ed25519 key pair (generated and stored locally in keys) is used to sign the SHA-256 hash of the concatenated checksums. This signature is stored in signature.bin.\n\nVerification on Import: When agm import-context runs, it performs the checks in reverse order:\n\nIt first verifies that the checksum of every file matches the value in checksums.json. If any file has been altered, it fails immediately with exit code 4 (Checksum Mismatch). This prevents wasting CPU cycles on a tampered package.\n\nIf the checksums match, it then verifies the signature against the public key. If the signature is invalid, it fails with exit code 3 (Invalid Signature).\n\nThis layered approach ensures both integrity and authenticity.\n\n3. Policy-Driven Operation\n\nThe tool is governed by a policy.json file in your project's .antigoldfishmode directory. This file is your control panel for the tool's behavior.\n\n\n\nCommand Whitelisting: You can restrict which agm commands are allowed to run. For example, you could disable export-context entirely in a highly sensitive project.\n\nFile Path Globs: Restrict the tool to only read from specific directories (e.g., src and docs, but not dist or node\\_modules).\n\nEnforced Signing Policies:\n\n\"requireSignedContext\": true: The tool will refuse to import any .agmctx bundle that isn't signed with a valid signature. This is a critical security control for teams.\n\n\"forceSignedExports\": true: This makes signing non-optional. Even if a user tries to export with --no-sign, the policy will override it and sign the export.\n\n4. Transparent Auditing via Receipts and Journal\n\nYou should never have to wonder what the tool did.\n\nReceipts: Every significant command (export, import, index-code, etc.) generates a JSON receipt in receipts. This receipt contains a cryptographic hash of the inputs and outputs, timing data, and a summary of the operation.\n\nJournal: A journal.jsonl file provides a chronological, append-only log of every command executed and its corresponding receipt ID. This gives you a complete, verifiable audit trail of all actions performed by the tool.\n\nThis combination of features is designed to provide a tool that is not only powerful but also transparent, verifiable, and secure enough for the most sensitive development environments.\n\nYou can check out the source code on GitHub: [\n\n", "link": "https://github.com/jahboukie/antigoldfish", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Check out CyberCine! \ud83c\udfac A slick, cinematic hacker screen built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS", "summary": "", "link": "https://makalin.github.io/CyberCine", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
