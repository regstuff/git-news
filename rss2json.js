Forensic Anthropology or Osteoarchaeology?", "summary": "I've posted this in the Anthropology group but wanted to get your guys opinions too - this might be an odd question, but I've always been interested in how a person's body structure and skeleton changes due to how it's used - specifically, in terms of activities like archery and horse riding etc. Activities where we've heard of skeletons found with anomalies that show partaking in certain activites had an impact on their body structure. I've heard bits over the years but would like to learn more, I'm just not sure where to start. (I'm particularly interested in how our bodies change in relation to horse riding at the moment, at least as starting point, as it's a big part of my life in general but the other areas are massively fascinating, for me, too.) Ideally, I'd love to learn how these things impact our muscles, ligaments and organs etc, too. (I.e. could these changes lead to fertility or birthing issues, etc, the way things like low or high body fat percentages do - low BF causing amenorrhea, for example.)\n\nCan anyone suggest a good place to start, please?
