They want to explore options with Russia, China, Turkey and other powers.\n\nChad\u2019s President Mahamat Deby would not have made this decision if he did not have security guarantees from another actor. We know he\u2019s received serious support from the United Arab Emirates, who are very interested in what\u2019s going on in neighboring Sudan and Darfur. We know that Turkey also made some outreach.\n\nChad borders four countries with Russian military presence. In January, Deby traveled to Moscow to reinforce relations with the \u201cpartner country.\u201d\n\nMilitary leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso who expelled the French military have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians.\n\nBut the security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from both armed groups and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase over the previous six months.\n\nIt is impossible to say whether the departure of French forces led to the increased violence. But it created a \u201chuge security vacuum,\u201d said analyst Shaantanu Shankar with the Economist Intelligence Unit, adding that it cannot be filled by Russia.

A little about myself, I have an intense passion for history mainly in cultural and diplomatic fields, ask me anything about any place and I have a grasp on a general story that people like to listen to me illuminate it to them. Although I have been worried about future job aspects because I know history is a hard topic to find a good job in and that degree doesn't get far. I talked to my professor and he agreed with me.. although he does work part time at a community college, so who knows. I have been looking to jump majors for a moment now and next semester I plan to take courses in a required compsci class, recent American history, and most importantly sociology. To cut my rambling short I was also looking into law as a degree as I think my interest in diplomacy could translate into reading law books and becoming a sort of consultant. Although, after speaking to my father who once knew archaeologists, I have done some (grantedly minimal so far) research on the field and have grown more interested. I like the idea of specializing in a region or culture and figuring them out, to work with other smart people in stuff we enjoy and talk about. Would this be a good field to take into serious consideration? Where should I begin? I know there are positions for part-time digging that people can get into. For final clarifications, I also live in Arizona, and I know here and there about the cultures of the O'odham, Hopi, and Dine' civilizations around me and I presume that's probably common in my area for people to study &amp; excavate, i.e. the irrigation canals and such.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1hkca8x/would_archaeologyanthropology_be_a_good_major_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU should spare carmakers from \u2018punitive\u2019 emissions fines, says Scholz | Automotive industry", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/20/eu-carmakers-emissions-fines-olaf-scholz-germany-vw", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia poses a bigger threat to European Union security than just defence as Moscow can use illegal immigration and other issues to undermine the bloc, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-pm-says-eu-will-not-allow-russia-others-endanger-security-through-2024-12-22/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India, Ghana ink MoU to boost collaboration in sat communication | India News - Times of India", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-ghana-ink-mou-to-boost-collaboration-in-sat-communication/articleshow/116549868.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is David de Hilster legit?", "summary": "Saw this on LinkedIn ", "link": "https://youtu.be/QLTfJqOA6l0?si=k7-QX_cW2wDTJk8u", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran\u2019s Energy Crisis Hits \u2018Dire\u2019 Point as Industries Are Forced to Shut Down - The New York Times", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/iran-economy-energy-crisis.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
