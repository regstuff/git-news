For Example, Ida pinned a large diamond brooch to her cheap sweater and officials assumed it was fake. They repeated this trick several times.", "summary": "You can click on the link to the article but I'll give a TL:DR version of the story (additional information supplied from Wikipedia).\n\n  \nBoth girls were born in Sunderland, Louise in 1901, Ida in 1904. By 1934 both girls, now considered spinsters,  were living together in London and working civil service jobs although Ida would soon be a successful romance author under the pen name Mary Burchell (her first book was published in 1936). Ida and Louise both had a passion for opera and frequently traveled so they could see their favorite operas. That year Ida and Louise were both in Salzburg attending an opera festival. They became acquainted with a Romanian opera singer named Viorica Ursuleac and her Austrian husband, a conductor named Clemens Krauss who were both secretly involved in helping Jews escape from the Nazis. The sisters were told about the plight of Jews in Austria and Germany and what they heard moved them so much that they knew they needed to act. Back in Britain the sisters contributed their own money and later donations from friends to help resettle Jews in Britain. Later they agreed to covertly transport expensive jewelry owned by Jews out of occupied territory. This was illegal as Jews weren't allowed to take any valuable items out of the country so Ida and Louise took a big risk doing this. That's when Ida had to transport the large diamond brooch and got the idea to pin it to the front of her cheap cardigan from Marks and Spencer's. It worked so well that Ida and Louise repeated the ruse several more times. On the rare occasions when they were stopped by officials they would \u201cdo the nervous British spinster act\u201d and act so crazy that any official would back off. As an example I'll quote this anecdote from the article \"When an Austrian frontier official questioned Louise\u2019s opulent string of pearls that she was wearing along with her otherwise inexpensive outfit, she acted affronted, exclaiming, \u201cAnd why not?!\u2019 She frantically ran to a mirror and looked at herself, all the while yelling at the inspector, \u201cWhat is wrong with my appearance?
