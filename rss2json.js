However, it also found that he cannot request an apology for the error.\n\nThe ruling comes as part of a long-running legal battle fought by Stanis\u0142aw Zalewski (pictured above), a former member of the Polish underground resistance who is president of the Polish Association of Former Political Prisoners of Nazi Prisons and Concentration Camps. He turned 100 in October.\n\nThe case originated in April 2017, when a German newspaper publisher, Mittelbayerischer Verlag KG, published an article about a Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivor whose sister, it said, was \u201cmurdered in the Polish extermination camp of Treblinka\u201d.\n\nInternational media often mistakenly refer to Nazi-German camps established in occupied Poland as \u201cPolish\u201d. The Polish authorities have long campaigned against such usage, as it suggests that Poland, rather than Germany, was responsible for establishing and running the camps.\n\nIn this case, Mittelbayerischer Verlag changed its article within a few hours following intervention by the Polish consulate in Munich. Its corrected text stated that the sister \u201cwas murdered by the Nazis in the German Nazi extermination camp of Treblinka in occupied Poland\u201d.\n\nHowever, seven months later, in November 2017, Zalewski filed a civic lawsuit against the publisher at a Warsaw court demanding that it refrain from using the term \u201cPolish camps\u201d, publish an apology on its website for infringing his personal rights, and pay 50,000 zloty (\u20ac11,800) to his association.\n\nThat sparked a complex legal battle, as the case made its way between various Polish courts, including the Supreme Court, and also the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nAt question were two central and related issues: whether Zalewski, who was not referred to in Mittelbayerischer Verlag\u2019s article, had the right to bring the case; and whether he was able to bring it in Poland, rather than Germany.\n\nEventually, earlier this year, the Supreme Court found that the case could be heard in Poland. On Wednesday last week, however, in a closed session, the court of appeal in Warsaw ruled that, while Zalewski can pursue compensation, he cannot demand an apology, reports the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily.\n\nWhat that means in effect is that\u00a0Zalewski could now return to the lower courts and seek compensation. Legal news service [Prawo.pl]( notes that Zalewski could also appeal to the Supreme Court against last week\u2019s ruling, arguing that he should also be allowed to seek an apology.\n\nHowever, given that he has just turned 100, the case is a \u201crace against time\u201d and a further appeal could \u201cdelay the proceedings for several more years\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIn the past, another former Polish prisoner of Auschwitz, Karol Tendera, fought a similar legal battle with German public broadcaster ZDF, demanding an apology for its use of the term \u201cPolish death camp\u201d. The case was then\u00a0[continued by his son](\u00a0following Tendera\u2019s death in 2019.\n\nIn a separate case, ZDF was\u00a0[ordered](\u00a0by a Polish court to apologise\u00a0for portraying Polish World War Two resistance fighters as antisemites in its drama series\u00a0*Generation War*\u00a0(*Unsere M\u00fctter, unsere V\u00e4ter*).\n\nSuch issues continue to cause controversy. Last week, the Polish government\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0Israel\u2019s Holocaust remembrance centre, Yad Vashem, for a social media post suggesting that Poland was responsible for introducing anti-Jewish measures during the Holocaust rather than the Nazi-German occupiers.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/01/former-auschwitz-prisoner-can-sue-german-publisher-for-writing-polish-death-camp-rules-court/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Several Ukrainian children abducted by Russia forcibly sent to North Korea, expert tells US Senate", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/several-russia-abducted-ukrainian-children-forcibly-transferred-to-north-korea-expert-tells-us-senate-committee/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The rise of deepfake pornography in schools: \u2018One girl was so horrified she vomited\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/dec/02/the-rise-of-deepfake-pornography-in-schools", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel says Rafah crossing to open soon to let Gazans leave via Egypt", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwk7xen544o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Europe, Canada on track to buy \u20ac4.3bn of weapons for Ukraine this year, Rutte says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/12/03/europe-canada-on-track-to-buy-43bn-of-us-weapons-for-ukraine-this-year-rutte-says", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU finalizes deal to phase out Russian gas imports by 2027", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/eu-finalizes-deal-to-phase-out-russian-gas-imports-by-2027", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kenyan MPs accuse British soldiers of decades of sexual abuse", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgq5dvygllo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spain faces 2.3 million citizenship requests from Franco-era exiles", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/2025/12/03/spain-overwhelmed-by-23-million-citizenship-applications-from-franco-era-descendants", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland charges Russian with orchestrating sabotage network", "summary": "Polish prosecutors have filed five charges against a Russian national accused of running an espionage and sabotage network in Poland on behalf of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n\nThey are also seeking to obtain an Interpol red notice for the suspect, who carried out his activities from Russia. He is accused of organising and directing a spy ring whose members \u2013 mostly Ukrainians and Belarusians \u2013 were convicted in Poland in 2023.\n\nInvestigators believe that the man, a 28-year-old called Mikhail Mirgorodsky, coordinated intelligence activities in Poland via the Telegram messaging service, including surveillance of military sites, attempted sabotage, and dissemination of pro-Russian propaganda.\n\nThey filed five charges against Mirgorodsky, including for establishing and leading an organised criminal group of a terrorist nature, conducting foreign intelligence operations, and financing terrorist crimes. The first charge carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe case forms part of a wider investigation into a Russian network active in Poland.\n\nIn mid-2023, Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency (ABW) detained 16 people (13 Ukrainians, two Belarusians and one Russian) who were, in December that year,\u00a0[convicted](\u00a0of carrying out espionage, sabotage and propaganda activities on behalf of Russia.\n\nProsecutors say that further investigation into the group led them to find that Mirgorodsky was responsible for coordinating their activities.\n\nAccording to the charges, Mirgorodsky instructed the group of at least 30 members to monitor military vehicles and infrastructure, install GPS tracking devices and data transmitters, and distribute pro-Russian and anti-NATO leaflets.\n\nHe is also accused of inciting an attempted derailment of a train, an act classified as a terrorist offence, and of inciting members of the network to use violence and threats against Ukrainians and Belarusian dissidents and set fire to their property.\n\nThe suspect is not in Poland, and prosecutors say they have been unable to question him. A court in Lublin approved a request for pretrial detention in August, and authorities have issued a domestic arrest warrant and are seeking an Interpol Red Notice.\n\nIn a separate statement, the ABW also revealed today that seven other members of the network run by Mirgorodsky are being charged: one Pole, one Lithuanian, three Belarusians, one Ukrainian, and another Russian\n\n\u201cFurther actions are also underway to identify at least six additional individuals,\u201d they added.\n\nThey ABW also noted that the group \u201cwas formed with the direct support and at the request of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, which provided funding and technical support\u201d.\n\nMirgorodsky\u2019s expertise in cryptocurrency was used by the FSB to help facilitate payments to their operatives.\n\nSince 2023, Poland has been hit by a wave of other espionage and sabotage activities\u00a0[carried out largely by Ukrainian and Belarusian](\u00a0immigrants on behalf of Russia,\n\nIncidents have included a series of arson attacks, including one that\u00a0[destroyed Warsaw\u2019s biggest shipping centre]( and, most recently,\u00a0[sabotage of a rail line](\u00a0running between Warsaw and Lublin.\n\nIn response, the Polish government has successively closed down all three of Russia\u2019s consulates operating in Poland, first in\u00a0[Pozna\u0144](\u00a0last year, followed by\u00a0[Krak\u00f3w](\u00a0and\u00a0[Gda\u0144sk](\u00a0this year.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/02/poland-charges-russian-with-orchestrating-sabotage-network/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yemen\u2019s Houthis release mariners held since July ship attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/yemen-ship-houthis-release-mariners-eternity-54d87ebd3c8c36d5a2b8216b9386b404", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Battlefield gains by Sudan\u2019s ruthless paramilitary rattle regional powers \u2022 After the atrocities of El Fasher, the RSF prepares for another bloody showdown as it targets a new army-held city", "summary": "In the weeks since securing one of their biggest victories of the civil war, seizing the western city of El Fasher, battlefield momentum has swung behind the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in its calamitous two-and-a-half-year conflict against the Sudanese army and allied militia.\n\nAfter consolidating control of El Fasher and the surrounding region of Darfur \u2014 slaughtering men, raping women and holding unknown numbers for ransom \u2014 the RSF is pushing east and south into Kordofan in an offensive set to compound what the UN describes as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nFierce fighting at the garrison town of Babanusa, on the way to the army-held city of El Obeid in central Sudan, augurs another bloody showdown.
