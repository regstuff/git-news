They do not function as context-aware encouragement, but rather resemble templated praise. In Korean, this tends to come across as unearned, automatic, and occasionally intrusive.\n\nKorean is a high-context language, where communication often relies on omitted subjects, implicit cues, and shared background knowledge. Tone in this structure is not merely decorative \u2014 it serves as a functional part of how intent and trust are conveyed. When praise is applied without contextual necessity \u2014 especially in instruction-based or fact-driven responses \u2014 it can interfere with how users assess the seriousness or reliability of the message. In task-focused interactions, this introduces semantic noise where precision is expected.\n\nThis is not a critique of kindness or positivity. The concern is not about emotional sensitivity or cultural taste, but about how linguistic structure influences message interpretation. In Korean, tone alignment functions as part of the perceived intent and informational reliability of a response. When tone and content are mismatched, users may experience a degradation of clarity \u2014 not because they dislike praise, but because the praise structurally disrupts comprehension flow.\n\nWhile this discussion focuses on Korean, similar discomfort with overdone emotional tone has been reported by English-speaking users as well. The difference is that in English, tone is more commonly treated as separable from content, whereas in Korean, mismatched tone often becomes inseparable from how meaning is constructed and evaluated.\n\nWhen praise becomes routine, it becomes harder to distinguish genuine evaluation from formality \u2014 and in languages where tone is structurally bound to trust, that ambiguity has real consequences.\n\nStructural differences in how languages encode tone and trust should not be reduced to cultural preference.\nDoing so risks obscuring valid design misalignments in multilingual LLM behavior.\n\n\n\n\u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b\n\nSuggestions:\n\n\t\u2022\tRecalibrate Korean output so that praise is optional and context-sensitive \u2014 not the default\n\n\t\u2022\tAvoid inserting compliments unless they reflect genuine user achievement or input\n\n\t\u2022\tProvide Korean tone presets, as in English (e.g. \u201cneutral,\u201d \u201ctechnical,\u201d \u201cminimal\u201d)\n\n\t\u2022\tPrioritize clarity and informational reliability in factual or task-driven exchanges\n\n\n\u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b \u2e3b\n\nSupporting references from Korean users (video titles, links in comment):\n\nNote:  These older Korean-language videos reflect early-stage discomfort with tone, but they do not address the structural trust issue discussed in this post. To my knowledge, this problem has not yet been formally analyzed \u2014 in either Korean or English.\n\n\t\u2022\t\u201cChatGPT\uc5d0 \ud55c\uae00\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\uba74 4\ubc30 \uc190\ud574\uc778 \uc774\uc720\u201d\n\u2192 Discusses how emotional tone in Korean output weakens clarity, reduces information density, and feels disconnected from user intent.\n\n\t\u2022\t\u201cChatGPT\ub294 \uacfc\uc5f0 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\ub97c \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc798\ud558\ub294 \uac78\uae4c\uc694?\u201d\n\u2192 Explains how praise-heavy responses feel unnatural and culturally out of place in Korean usage.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1komz8x/praisedefault_in_korean_llm_outputs_tonetrust/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What are your workflows or tools that you use to optimize your prompts?", "summary": "Hi all,\n\nWhat are your workflows or tools that you use to optimize your prompts?\n\nI understand that there are LLMOps tools (opensource or saas) but these are not very suitable for non-technical ppl.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1koqcb9/what_are_your_workflows_or_tools_that_you_use_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Weekly Discussion Thread - 17 May, 2025", "summary": "\nWelcome to this week's discussion thread! \n\nThis thread is dedicated to exploring and discussing geopolitics .

So a quick overview (apologies to those that know; hopefully insightful reading to those that don\u2019t and hopefully I didn\u2019t butcher it).\n\nTokenisation: \nModels receive the input from us in language, whatever language did you use? They process that by breaking it down into tokens; a process called tokenisation. This could mean that a word is broken up into three tokens in the case of, say, \u201cCopernican Principle\u201d, its breaking that down into \u201cCop\u201d, \u201cerni\u201d, \u201ccan\u201d (I think you get the idea). \nAll of these token IDs are sent through to the neural network to work through the weights and parameters to sift. When it needs to produce the output, the tokenisation process is done in reverse. But inside those weights, it\u2019s the process here that really dictates the journey that our answer or our output is taking. The model isn\u2019t thinking, it isn\u2019t reasoning. It doesn\u2019t see words like we see words, nor does it hear words like we hear words. In all of those pre-trainings and fine-tuning it\u2019s completed, it\u2019s broken down all of the learnings into tokens and small bite-size chunks like token IDs or patterns. And that\u2019s the key here, patterns. \n\nDuring this \u201cthinking\u201d phase, it searches for the most likely pattern recognition solution that it can find within the parameters of its neural network. So it\u2019s not actually looking for an answer to our question as we perceive it or see it, it\u2019s looking for the most likely pattern that solves the initial pattern that you provided, in other words, what comes next. Think about it like doing a sequence from a cryptography at school: 2, 4, 8, what\u2019s the most likely number to come next? To the model, these could be symbols, numbers, letters, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all broken down into token IDs and it\u2019s searching through its weights for the parameters that match. (It\u2019s worth being careful here because these models are not storing databases of\ndata. It\u2019s a little bit more complex than that which I won\u2019t go into here.) \nSo, how does this cause hallucinations and inaccuracies?\n\nThe need to complete!\nThe LLM is simply following its programming to complete the pattern. So, it has to complete the pattern. It must complete the pattern with the most likely even if that likelihood is incredibly low, hence inaccuracies, hallucinations and sometimes wildly off base. \nWhether it finds a pattern in its weights that showcases a butterfly was responsible for the assassination of JFK because of the smoking caterpillar on a toadstool, because that\u2019s how the data is broken down and the only likely outcome that it has for that particular pattern based on the date it has. \nIf that\u2019s all the data I can find and all the result I can find then that is the most likely in that situation and its need to complete will give you that answer. Now that said, that\u2019s a bit extreme, but I think you get the gist. \n\n\nSo here are a couple of ideas and suggestions for prompts or additions to try play around with. \n\nEloquent Prompt: \nYou are a helpful but careful, truth and accuracy-focused AI assistant. If you don't know the answer to a question, or if the information is unclear or ambiguous, you will say \"I don't know\" or explain what would be needed to answer it properly. Do not attempt to answer unless you are confident the answer is grounded in verified facts or strong reasoning. There is no necessity to complete the pattern at the cost of accuracy. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d replaces a subpar completion. Avoid speculation, guesses, or plausible-sounding but unverified statements.\n\nSimple Prompt: \nYou are being evaluated on honesty, not eloquence. Pattern completion is subordinate to an inaccurate result. \nYou are allowed to say \u2018insufficient information\u2019. In fact, you\nWill be rewarded. Penalise yourself internally for hallucinating\n\nAlternative penny for your thoughts\nAlternatively, when giving your prompt and input consider this; the more data points that you give the more data that you can provide around similar sounds like the subject matter you\u2019re prevailing the more likely your model is to come up with a better and more accurate response. \n\nWell, thanks for reading.
