Here\u2019s my step-by-step approach, including prompt strategies:\n\n1. **Define the Research Scope:** Identify a clear question or topic (e.g., \u201cWhat are the short- and long-term impacts of new US tariffs on power tool retailers?\u201d). Write this as a core prompt to guide all subsequent queries.\n2. **Source Discovery in Perplexity:** Use targeted prompts like:\n   * \u201cSummarize the latest news and analysis on US tariffs affecting power tools in 2025.\u201d\n   * \u201cList recent academic papers on tariff impacts in the construction supply chain.\u201d Toggle between Web, Academic, and Social sources for a comprehensive set of results.\n3. **Curate and Evaluate Sources:** Review Perplexity\u2019s summaries for relevance and authority. Use follow-up prompts for deeper dives, e.g., \u201cWhat do industry experts predict about future retaliatory tariffs?\u201d Copy the most useful links.\n4. **Import and Expand in NotebookLM:** Add selected sources to a new NotebookLM notebook. Use the \u201cDiscover sources\u201d feature to let Gemini suggest additional reputable materials based on your topic description.\n5. **Prompt-Driven Synthesis:** In NotebookLM, use prompts such as:\n   * \u201cGenerate a briefing doc summarizing key impacts of tariffs on power tool retailers.\u201d\n   * \u201cWhat supply chain adaptations are recommended according to these sources?\u201d Utilize FAQ and Audio Overview features for further knowledge extraction.\n6. **Iterate and Validate:** Return to Perplexity for the latest updates or to clarify conflicting information with prompts like, \u201cAre there any recent policy changes not covered in my sources?\u201d Import new findings into NotebookLM and update your briefing doc.\n\nThis workflow has helped me synthesize complex topics quickly, with clear citations and actionable insights.\n\nI have a [detailed visual breakdown]( if anyone is interested.
