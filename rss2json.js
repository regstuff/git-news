The fact that Indian state\u00a0[Punjab]( where \\~57% of its inhabitants are of Sikh faith. The Khalistan issue seems to be of Sikhs in Canada (and other areas of the world) demanding a separate state\u00a0**because Punjab is a Sikh-majority**\u00a0state. Now, this argument makes sense from their perspective BUT.. this 57% figure was of the 2011 census India. There will be a census that will be conducted this year and be release earlier to mid-2025.\n\nNow, Sikh population has been on the decline\u00a0**percentage-wise**\u00a0from last 2 decades. Given that Punjab birth rates were\u00a0[among the lowest](\u00a0and you have to account: migrant labor from other states, huge amounts of emigration and small-to-medium scale conversions to Christianity, the Sikh demographics are\u00a0**destined to fall under 50%**\u00a0either in this upcoming census or in next census in 2031.\n\nOnce Sikhs reach &lt;50% of the population over in Punjab, a VERY BIG (probably the biggest) reason for the Khalistanis asking for independence, and seeking referendums will be nullified. While, it kinda pains me to see \"my people\" become a minority-majority there but in this context, it def is a good sign that the hardliners will need very strong reasons to keep things going (which they don't).\n\nLastly, I suspect, as India's economy grows, and governments change (Modi is getting older and could even lose the next election, he already has a minority govt and we all know Trudeau is on his way out), I certainly see sometime in 2030 where both Indian-Canadian leaders are shaking hands at some international conference and discussing good relations between the countries.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1g7eeki/one_silver_lining_i_see_from_this_canadaindia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Overdose Deaths in the United States Fall 12.7% During the 12 Months Ending in May \u201824", "summary": "\u201cThis is the largest recorded reduction in overdose deaths,\u201d White House officials said in a statement. \u201cAnd the sixth consecutive month of reported decreases in predicted 12-month total numbers of drug overdose deaths.\u201d", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/drug-overdose-deaths-fall-6-months-straight-officials-wonder-working-rcna175888", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Mounties take on Modi.

When Modi went to Pakistan, Pakistan responded by Pathankot attacks. For Pakistan, peace talks are an alternate way for continuing a war whose end goal is to balkanize India.\n\nIndia and Pakistan signed the Simla accord. Pledging non aggression against each other was a perfect opportunity and excuse for Pakistani leaders to explain to their people that they were duty bound not to unleash war against India. Yet, they violated the treaty every single day with a war of a thousand cuts, first in Punjab and then in Kashmir, and finally across every major city of India.\n\nCurrently they are caught in an economic trap. Trading with India is one of the easy ways for them to benefit. The good thing about economic relations is that it creates a constituency that favors peace. Yet, the fact remains that Imran Khan was able to stop all cross border economic activity at a moment's notice when Article 370 was scrapped.\n\nThe army used Jihadis to launch terror strikes against India. We also see evidence that Pakistani army is in control when they turned off the terror faucet under pressure from the Americans. If they turn off the terror factories now, the capability remains. Even if Pakistani moderates (even if they are moderates only by Pakistani standards) support stopping terror right now, the next government - military or civilian - can restart it.\n\nEngagement with India is a win for Pakistan as long as they can pursue the long term goal of the destruction of India. That's been the case all the days from Jinnah. Given this background what should be India's minimal requirement to engage with Pakistan?\n\nHere are a few thoughts of what India could ask of Pakistan prior to engagement:\n\n1. Land access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. It's of minimal value. Afghanistan is unstable and they have very little to trade in any case. If land routes are used through Pakistan and then through Iran, that area is also quite unstable. Also, do we then undercut Chabahar?\n\n2. Turn over Dawood Ibrahim and dismantle his gang. This should be easier than turning off other faucets of terror as Pakistan has consistently denied that he is even present in Pakistan (everybody knows where he lives and he enjoys 24/7 protection of the army). The other sources of terror derive their militancy from Islamic extremism that meshes with Pakistani army.\n\n3. Agree to free trade. Trade has been a great source of geo-political stability as we can see in the creation of the European Union or the massive trade between USA and China. However, we have seen in the past, Pakistan disengaged trade with India even at the cost of self harm. The small trade that used to exist across the Kashmiri border quickly turned into a conduit for drugs and weapons. Even cricket games were used by Pakistanis to slip into India. If thousands of trucks went across the border everyday, do we have the wherewithal to prevent terrorist activities under the guise of trade.  \n\nNote that it is foolish to expect that Pakistan will give up the goals they have pursued for the last 75 years in one grand gesture. For real peace, Pakistan would have to restructure, which isn't on the table. So, the question is: What kind of a win-win engagement is possible with a mortal enemy that hasn't give up hostility?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1g7g07k/realistically_what_can_india_ask_of_pakistan/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli strikes kill 33 people in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, medics say | Israel reportedly cuts off communication networks in northern Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sends-more-troops-into-north-gaza-deepens-raid-2024-10-18/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'Significant progress:' Efforts continue to eliminate statutes of limitations for rape", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/19/statute-limitations-rape-cases-dna-evidence/75735181007/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "First salmon swims all the way to Oregon after historic California dam removal", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dfw.state.or.us/news/2024/10_Oct/101724.asp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Automating 2D drawing and manga colorization using Stable Diffusion models, Controlnet &amp; YoloV8 Segmentation", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/kitsumed/PictureColorDiffusion", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel bars six medical NGOs from entry to Gaza, WHO says | The World Health Organization said Israel provided no explanation for barring its partner organizations from the Strip, where the health-care system has collapsed.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/18/israel-gaza-war-aid-hospitals-doctors/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Drone 'launched towards' Israeli PM Netanyahu's home", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl4e7w2e7o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Daily Random XKCD] a Scalable, Open-Source, XKCD Comic RSS Feed Generator (XKCD API, GitHub Actions, RSS.app integration) ", "summary": "Hi everyone!\n\nI recently built a fun project that automatically generates a daily random XKCD comic and serves it as an RSS feed.
