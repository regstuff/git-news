Found something that changes everything.\n\n**The discovery:**\u00a0ChatGPT has a hidden \"reasoning mode\" that most people never trigger. When you activate it, response quality jumps dramatically.\n\n**How I found this:**\n\nBeen testing thousands of prompts and noticed some responses were suspiciously better than others. Same model, same settings, but completely different thinking depth.\n\nAfter analysing the pattern, I found the trigger.\n\n**The secret pattern:**\n\nChatGPT performs significantly better when you force it to \"show its work\" BEFORE giving the final answer. But not just any reasoning -\u00a0**structured reasoning**.\n\n**The magic prompt structure:**\n\n    Before answering, work through this step-by-step:\n    \n    1. UNDERSTAND: What is the core question being asked?\n    2. ANALYZE: What are the key factors/components involved?\n    3. REASON: What logical connections can I make?\n    4. SYNTHESIZE: How do these elements combine?\n    5. CONCLUDE: What is the most accurate/helpful response?\n    \n    Now answer: [YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION]\n    \n\n**Example comparison:**\n\n**Normal prompt:**\u00a0\"Explain why my startup idea might fail\"\n\n**Response:**\u00a0Generic risks like \"market competition, funding challenges, poor timing...\"\n\n**With reasoning pattern:**\n\n    Before answering, work through this step-by-step:\n    1. UNDERSTAND: What is the core question being asked?\n    2. ANALYZE: What are the key factors/components involved?\n    3. REASON: What logical connections can I make?\n    4. SYNTHESIZE: How do these elements combine?\n    5. CONCLUDE: What is the most accurate/helpful response?\n    \n    Now answer: Explain why my startup idea (AI-powered meal planning for busy professionals) might fail\n    \n\n**Response:**\u00a0Detailed analysis of market saturation, user acquisition costs for AI apps, specific competition (MyFitnessPal, Yuka), customer behavior patterns, monetization challenges for subscription models, etc.\n\n**The difference is insane.**\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nWhen you force ChatGPT to structure its thinking, it activates deeper processing layers. Instead of pattern-matching to generic responses, it actually reasons through your specific situation.\n\n**I tested this on 50 different types of questions:**\n\n* Business strategy: 89% more specific insights\n* Technical problems: 76% more accurate solutions\n* Creative tasks: 67% more original ideas\n* Learning topics: 83% clearer explanations\n\n**Three more examples that blew my mind:**\n\n**1. Investment advice:**\n\n* Normal: \"Diversify, research companies, think long-term\"\n* With pattern: Specific analysis of current market conditions, sector recommendations, risk tolerance calculations\n\n**2. Debugging code:**\n\n* Normal: \"Check syntax, add console.logs, review logic\"\n* With pattern: Step-by-step code flow analysis, specific error patterns, targeted debugging approach\n\n**3. Relationship advice:**\n\n* Normal: \"Communicate openly, set boundaries, seek counselling\"\n* With pattern: Detailed analysis of interaction patterns, specific communication strategies, timeline recommendations\n\n**The kicker:**\u00a0This works because it mimics how ChatGPT was actually trained. The reasoning pattern matches its internal architecture.\n\n**Try this with your next 3 prompts and prepare to be shocked.**\n\n**Pro tip:**\u00a0You can customise the 5 steps for different domains:\n\n* For creative tasks: UNDERSTAND \u2192 EXPLORE \u2192 CONNECT \u2192 CREATE \u2192 REFINE\n* For analysis: DEFINE \u2192 EXAMINE \u2192 COMPARE \u2192 EVALUATE \u2192 CONCLUDE\n* For problem-solving: CLARIFY \u2192 DECOMPOSE \u2192 GENERATE \u2192 ASSESS \u2192 RECOMMEND\n\n**What's the most complex question you've been struggling with?

Trump and JD Vance were not bothered about the IND vs PAK war until India hit Kirana Hills, which houses nuclear facilities rumoured &amp; secretly governed by the US. This made them panic, and Uncle Sam jumped in to stop India, which surprised him \u2014 that India could do something like that.\n\n2. Trump invited Modi to the White House from the G7 summit (when it was already known that Asim Munir was invited at the same time) to show the world that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, for which Modi said no and went on with his schedule. Here, his plan failed.\n\n3. In the Parliament, Modi fearlessly said that no world leader pressurized him into the ceasefire, which made Uncle Sam very angry \u2014 who's waiting for a \"Nobel Peace Prize\" which the white house demanded without shame.\n\n4. When the tariffs were at 25%, MEA issued a statement calling out the US, saying that they themselves import uranium and palladium from Russia \u2014 which is basically giving a middle finger to the US, exposing their hypocrisy, and saying \u201cwe don't care.\u201d\n\n5. Now the tariffs are at 50%, he said \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \"There will be a lot more.\" Uncle Sam is very angry.\n\n6. Plus, there's also BRICS, which is a threat to the US dollar.\n\n7. Also, the US invited India to purchase their F-35 fighter jet, knowing that they are costly and unreliable. India said no and went on to order 26 Rafales from France, embarrassing the largest supplier of arms globally.\n\n8. Trump thought Modi is a yes-man and he could puppet him around like he wants.

Pune\u2019s SME exporters who built their entire business on U.S. orders are scrambling to reprice contracts. Some may see margins vanish overnight.\n\nBut India is not the India of 1991.\n\nConsider these facts:  \n  \n1. The EU is now India\u2019s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $130 billion in 2023\u201324. Also, it is expected that we will sign a FTA with the EU.  \n  \n2.

So, we have started diversifying long before this tariff game.\n\nWe should remember that tariffs don\u2019t automatically destroy demand, they often make American buyers pay more. Recall that the 2018\u20132019 Trump tariffs on Chinese goods led to $57 billion in higher costs for American consumers.\n\nFor firms that still depend on a single market, this will be a harsh lesson in the risks of overexposure. But for the broader export economy, the incentives are now stronger than ever to pivot faster to Europe, ASEAN, and the Middle East.\n\nIf there is one lesson from past protectionist waves, it is that diversified economies bounce back quicker.  \n  \nA confident trading nation doesn\u2019t panic when one door closes, it steps through the others it has already prepared.  \n  \nIndia is not cornered. It is, in fact, positioned to turn this moment into a catalyst for even broader resilience, and that, more than any headline, should be the story we focus on.\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1mjpw60/india_of_2025_is_built_very_differently/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I wrote a book on sourdough and put the whole thing on GitHub, complete with instructions to 'bake the book' using Docker.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/hendricius/the-sourdough-framework", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poll: Ukrainians oppose Russian peace plan, favour EU proposal", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2025/08/7/7525106/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin to visit India in late August, Ifax reports | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/india/putin-visit-india-late-august-ifax-reports-2025-08-07/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
