Stuff like email classification, intent detection, ticket routing, why should we throw a 100B+ param model at it when a small, purpose-built model works just as well?\n\nSo we built SmolModels, small AI models that run locally or via API. No huge datasets, no cloud lock-in, just lightweight models that do one thing well. Open-sourced it here: [SmolModels GitHub](\n\nCurious if anyone else is working with smaller NLP models, what\u2019s been your experience?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ipning/smol_nlp_models_that_just_get_the_job_done/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Vice President JD Vance lectures European officials on free speech, illegal migration in security conference remarks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/vance-will-meet-zelenskyy-amid-concerns-about-trump-putin-talks-to-end-the-war-in-ukraine/ar-AA1z1rds", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Database of Archaeological Databases (Work in Progress)", "summary": "", "link": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YnOnCiRZv0KVaGSp7sWcjJFSNWQpPnQidRdBQpY9DQw/edit?usp=sharing", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Turn Entire YouTube Playlists to Markdown Formatted and Refined Text Books (in any language)", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Ebrizzzz/Youtube-playlist-to-formatted-text", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia asks Elon Musk to hand over names of dissidents", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/russia-elon-musk-list-names-dissidents-usaid-s798gktd7", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Approval rating of Brazil's Lula falls to 24% from 35%, pollster Datafolha says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-approval-rating-falls-24-35-pollster-datafolha-says-2025-02-14/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine secures return of 8 children from Russian-occupied territories", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-8-children-from-russian-occupied-territories/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Afghan arrested after car ramming \u2018attack\u2019 wounds 30 in Germany", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/afghan-held-after-suspected-ramming-attack-injures-28-in-germany/news-story/42f4b13ff4e3d41e410c2b281b042ae4", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Modi-Trump meeting: Reciprocal tariffs by U.S. may not hurt India much says GTRI", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/reciprocal-tariffs-by-us-may-not-hurt-india-much-gtri/article69218752.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Invasive \u2018murder hornets\u2019 are wiped out in the US, officials say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/us/invasive-murder-hornets-are-wiped-out-in-the-us-officials-say/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Palestinian booksellers decry detention by Israeli police over \u2018public disorder\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/14/palestinian-booksellers-decry-detention-by-israeli-police-over-public-disorder", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Clox v0.5 Release: A Geeky Clock for Terminal Enthusiasts", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/clox", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Missouri clinics will \u2018immediately\u2019 offer abortion after judge's ruling", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/missouri-clinics-will-immediately-offer-abortion-after-judges-ruling/article_ae48f722-eb30-11ef-86f0-739774ad6cda.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sweden shuts down mink farms: victory for animal welfare, but a ban is still needed", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.furfreealliance.com/sweden-shuts-down-mink-farms-victory-for-animal-welfare-but-a-ban-is-still-needed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Girl Scout learns CPR and saves dad's life days later", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.wvtm13.com/article/girl-saves-dad-cpr-virginia/63473104", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Brazil nixes BRICS currency, eyes less reliance on 'mighty' dollar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/brazil-nixes-brics-currency-eyes-less-reliance-mighty-dollar-2025-02-13/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EVs and datacentres driving new global \u2018age of electricity\u2019, says watchdog", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/14/electric-cars-datacentres-new-global-age-of-electricity", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Terraform CI/CD automation] - Terrateam: Open-source GitOps tooling for infrastructure", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Couple who fell in love despite not sharing a language celebrate 69 years of marriage", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/glasgow-couple-who-fell-love-31005227?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=reddit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "KeyTik: The All-in-One Automation Tool", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What are your thoughts on this list of India's 7 closest strategic partners?", "summary": "I had just come across an interesting article about a book written by professor Sreeram Chaulia.
