Russia has also used cryptocurrencies to pay operatives carrying out sabotage in Poland.\n\nHowever, in a subsequent vote, MPs split along party lines, with the right-wing opposition refusing to reject Nawrocki\u2019s veto. That meant the government failed to obtain the three-fifths majority needed to overturn it.\n\nOn Monday, Nawrocki\u00a0[vetoed](\u00a0the government\u2019s bill to regulate the crypto-assets market, which was intended to bring the country in line with EU rules. The president argued that the measures were too onerous, lacked transparency, and \u201cposed a real threat to the freedoms of Poles\u201d.\n\nFigures from the government, which has regularly clashed with Nawrocki on a variety of issues, criticised his decision, saying that it would leave Polish consumers open to becoming victims of fraud.\n\nToday, they also argued that the issue has national-security implications. Speaking in an open parliamentary session,\u00a0Tusk said that Nawrocki\u2019s veto benefited an unnamed company which he described as having \u201ccriminal\u201d sources of funding, with \u201cRussian infiltration\u2026evident\u201d and influence \u201cin the right-wing camp\u201d.\n\nTusk added that \u201cthis market is very susceptible to the tools and methods of foreign intelligence services and mafias\u201d.

However, he said that the information had been provided to MPs during a closed session held on Friday morning at his request.\n\nMPs are legally barred from revealing what was said at that session, but afterwards opposition politicians told the media that they did not understand why the information had been classified. Law and Justice (PiS), the main opposition party, has\u00a0submitted a motion to declassify it.\n\n\u201cDonald Tusk\u2019s charade must be made public,\u201d said PiS MP Janusz Kowalski, quoted by the Onet news website.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, likewise said that the secrecy surrounding the parliamentary session was completely unnecessary and was being used to cause fear among citizens and to distract from other problems the government is facing.\n\nHe asked Tusk why, if there is allegedly such a threat, his government had not acted earlier and only presented crypto regulations now, when other EU member states did so much earlier.\n\nIn recent years, Poland has faced a\u00a0[campaign of sabotage](\u00a0carried out by operatives working on behalf of Russia. Very often, they are\u00a0[Ukrainian and Belarusian immigrants](\u00a0hired through the Telegram messaging service by the Russian security services and paid with cryptocurrency.\n\nEarlier this week, Poland\u00a0[charged a Russian citizen](\u00a0accused of coordinating such operations. Authorities say he was recruited by Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) because of his expertise in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAfter both the secret and open parliamentary sessions had been held, the Sejm, the more powerful lower house, held a vote on whether to overturn Nawrocki\u2019s veto. Doing so would require a three-fifths majority.\n\nHowever, while a majority of 243 MPs \u2013 mostly from Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition \u2013 voted in favour, that was 18 short of the required threshold, given that 192 opposition MPs were opposed.\n\nOverturning presidential vetoes is extremely rare in Poland.

But the [Gaza]( war has also made clear that maintaining this type of bilateral relationship comes with steep costs. Washington has struggled without success to shape Israel\u2019s conduct of the war. That failure is not an anomaly; it is rooted in the nature of the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Israel receives treatment that no other ally or partner enjoys.\n\nThis exceptionalism has hindered the interests of both countries, in addition to inflicting immense harm on the Palestinians. Rather than helping ensure Israel\u2019s survival\u2014the policy\u2019s ostensible intent\u2014unconditional U.S. support has enabled the worst instincts of Israeli leaders. The results have been the relentless increase in illegal Israeli settlements and settler violence in the West Bank and mass civilian casualties in Gaza, along with famine in some areas. American support has enabled reckless Israeli military actions across the Middle East and exacerbated Israel\u2019s own existential dangers. In the United States, the war in Gaza has dramatically eroded public support for Israel, with unfavorable attitudes toward Israel at record highs across the political spectrum.\n\nThe relationship cannot continue in its current form indefinitely. For the [United States]( this long-overdue adjustment is a strategic, political, and moral imperative. From preventing Israel\u2019s annexation of the West Bank to forging a common strategy to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program, a normal U.S.-Israeli relationship would produce better outcomes.\n\nThe end of the [Cold War]( and the decisive U.S. victory in the first Gulf War seemed to create propitious circumstances for a comprehensive Middle East settlement. In pursuit of that goal, Clinton and his team offered practically unconditional rhetorical and material support to Israel, premised on a belief that a strong Israel with unstinting U.S. backing was more likely to take risks for peace.\n\nUnconditional support has led inexorably to moral hazard for both countries. Israel has no reason to accommodate American concerns and interests because refusing to do so costs nothing. Instead, Israel is emboldened to pursue maximalist positions that are often incompatible with U.S. interests and sometimes with Israeli interests, too. Israel has dealt severe blows to enemies it shares with the United States, and the practical guarantee of American support may help deter adversaries from attacking Israel. But because Israel\u2019s power far surpasses that of all rivals, this support creates a perverse incentive for Israel to act rashly and without necessity, confident that U.S. backing will continue regardless of the outcome of its adventurism. And unflagging support implicates the United States in Israel\u2019s actions, occasionally inviting direct retaliation against U.S. forces. Israel, in turn, chafes at the heightened scrutiny it receives from some segments of the American public because of the aid it enjoys.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military successes against its regional adversaries, moreover, may prove transitory. Iran\u2019s interest in developing a nuclear weapon has arguably increased as its conventional deterrent and sense of security diminish. Should Iran eventually build a primitive nuclear bomb\u2014or even return to the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, only this time without any monitoring regime in place\u2014it will not be possible to call the June war a success. Similarly, in the absence of credible, effective Palestinian governance in Gaza, Israel may be forced to choose between a costly occupation and a failed state on its border. Hezbollah\u2019s decline in Lebanon has so far worked to Israel\u2019s advantage, but it would be premature to rule out a far less favorable outcome.\n\nThe first requirement is to reach an understanding on shared and divergent goals and objectives, what each country is prepared to do to support the other\u2019s interests, and which actions would jeopardize this support\u2014to identify both expectations and limits. Conditionality must also become a feature of the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Conditioning assistance or policy on another country\u2019s alignment with U.S. goals is not always effective, but it can work.\n\nThe United States has several ways to set conditions for Israel. The expiration of the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding on security assistance in 2028, for example, would offer an appropriate time to reevaluate the contribution of American taxpayers\u2019 money to a wealthy country that now competes with American arms manufacturers for foreign sales.\n\nAs long as Trump is in the Oval Office and Netanyahu and his extremist coalition are in the driver\u2019s seat of the relationship, it is doubtful that Washington will fully commit to a coherent, institutionalized new approach. Yet it is not too soon to begin reckoning with what has gone wrong and discussing how to fix it. If the next opportunity to reset the increasingly vulnerable U.S.-Israeli relationship is missed, it will be to the detriment of Americans, Israelis, and Palestinians alike.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read a copy of the rest of the article here]( in case you cannot access the original page.", "link": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/end-israel-exception-andrew-miller", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Inside Syria\u2019s state-backed cover-up of Alawite women\u2019s kidnappings", "summary": "", "link": "https://thecradle.co/articles/inside-syrias-state-backed-cover-up-of-alawite-womens-kidnappings?fbclid=Iwb21leAOgLb1jbGNrA6AtuGV4dG4DYWVtAjExAHNydGMGYXBwX2lkDDM1MDY4NTUzMTcyOAABHuKHGoibVmRL1Pqe6Lzy0RmOd9j_HzYqD8S-5L7fUl9Vd8zANcqen4E55fzo_aem_TdXRsOR2M55ucJiAjeU1nw", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish parliament approves bill facilitating coal mine closures and compensation for miners", "summary": "Poland\u2019s parliament has approved a government bill intended to support the transition away from coal by allowing mines to be closed down more easily, introducing financial support for miners who lose their jobs, and helping redevelop former mining areas.\n\nThe measure won the support of MPs from Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right. Meanwhile, the right-wing opposition largely abstained from voting \u2013 prompting criticism from a coal miners\u2019 union.\n\nPoland is Europe\u2019s most coal-dependent country, with the fossil fuel\u00a0[accounting for 57% of power generation](\u00a0last year. While there has been a gradual shift away from coal, this has been accompanied by concerns about the impact it will have on coal-mining regions.\n\nWhen\u00a0[approving the bill](\u00a0in October, the government said that the measures would \u201cpave the way for a just transition in mining regions\u201d by \u201cproviding real support for thousands of miners\u201d while acting as a \u201cstimulus for investment and development, and the creation of new jobs\u201d.\n\nThe legislation would allow mining companies to decommission mines independently but with state financial backing. They can also transfer such assets as donations to local authorities or state entities, allowing them to be used for investments, revitalisation projects or infrastructure construction.\n\nThe bill would also introduce a package of protective benefits for workers at companies that are closing mines, including severance payments of 170,000 zloty (\u20ac40,000). The plan foresees five mines closing within the next decade and a complete phase-out of thermal coal mining by 2049.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s vote in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, 241 MPs in the 460-seat chamber voted in favour, most of them from the ruling coalition.\n\nOnly six lawmakers voted against it, but 186 abstained, largely from the two main opposition parties, the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) and far-right Confederation (Konfederacja).\n\nThe legislation will now go to the upper-house Senate, where the ruling coalition also holds a majority and which can in any case not block legislation. It must then be signed by opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, who is a strong advocate of coal.\n\nBefore the vote, Confederation MP Witold Tumanowicz, who was among those to abstain, criticised the bill for failing to present an alternative to coal.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that miners must be adequately protected now that we have decided to close the mines,\u201d he said, though adding that \u201cin our view \\[it\\] is a mistake\u201d to close the mines.\n\nHowever, what is now being proposed is simply \u201can attempt to extinguish social conflict\u201d rather than a genuine effort to develop Poland\u2019s energy sector, said Tumanowicz.\n\nPiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski did not take part in the vote at all. But he gave a speech on Thursday \u2013 which was Poland\u2019s annual Miners\u2019 Day, known as\u00a0*Barb\u00f3rka*\u00a0\u2013 in which he condemned \u201canti-mining propaganda\u201d and declared that coal \u201chas a future because it is cheap energy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all miners to believe in the future and that their hard work will continue,\u201d said Kaczy\u0144ski, during a meeting with miners. \u201cWe will do everything to ensure that it continues.\u201d\n\nHowever, the opposition\u2019s decision not to support the bill was met with criticism from Poland\u2019s biggest trade union, Solidarity, which represents many coal miners.\n\n\u201cEvery MP who voted against this bill or abstained acted extremely irresponsibly,\u201d said Dominik Kolorz, head of Solidarity in the\u00a0Silesian-D\u0105browa region, home to many coal mines.\n\n\u201cThe MPs knew perfectly well that, if this bill didn\u2019t come into force by the end of the year, coal companies would face bankruptcy,\u201d he added, accusing them of putting their party interests first.\n\nIt remains unclear whether, once the bill is sent to him by parliament, Nawrocki will sign it into law or exercise his right to veto it \u2013 as he has done with many government bills.\n\nIn a message to miners on Thursday, the president repeated one of his campaign slogans from earlier this year: that Poland must \u201cmine, extract and develop\u201d coal.\n\nWhile standing for election, Nawrocki called coal Poland\u2019s \u201cblack gold\u201d and said that he \u201ccannot imagine closing Polish mines\u201d until\u00a0Poland has a nuclear power plant. The country is preparing to build its first reactor, now expected to come online in 2036.\n\n\u201cYou have the right to employment stability,\u201d Nawrocki told union members at the Bielszowice mine and Huta Pok\u00f3j steelworks in January. He added, however, that if miners \u201creach an agreement with the government, after reviewing these documents, you can certainly count on my support\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s mining sector has been struggling in recent years. Polish coal is among the\u00a0[most expensive in the world](\u00a0to get out of the ground. Burning it causes significant emissions that bring costs under the EU Emissions Trading System.\n\nEurostat data show that Polish households have the\u00a0[EU\u2019s third-most expensive electricity]( when taking countries\u2019 costs of living into account.\n\nBut Poland\u2019s coal industry \u2013 with its long history and powerful unions \u2013 has long enjoyed political influence and public support. It is propped up by the state: to the tune of 9 billion zloty (\u20ac2.1 billion) this year and an estimated 5.5 billion in 2026.\n\nAccording to the energy ministry\u2019s impact assessment, the cost of closing hard coal mines under the new bill over the next decade will reach 11.3 billion zloty.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/05/polish-parliament-approves-bill-facilitating-coal-mine-closures-and-compensation-for-miners/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EXCLUSIVE: SaharaReporters Uncovers 23 Suspected Terror Financiers With Billions In Suspicious Transactions", "summary": "", "link": "https://saharareporters.com/2025/12/05/exclusive-saharareporters-uncovers-23-suspected-terror-financiers-billions-suspicious", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Terror Suspects, Alleged Financiers Were Linked To Powerful Nigerians Including Ex-AGF Malami, Former Army Chiefs, Others \u2013Maj.
