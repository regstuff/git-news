Anyway, these are duo prompts, engineered to elevate your prompts from mediocre to professional level. One prompt evaluates, the other one refines. You can use them separately until your prompt is perfect. \n\nThis prompt is different because of how flexible it is, the evaluation prompt evaluates across 35 criteria, everything from clarity, logic, tone, hallucination risks and many more. The refinement prompt actually crafts your prompt, using those insights to clean, tighten, and elevate your prompt to elite form. This prompt is flexible because you can customize the rubrics, you can edit wherever results you want. You don't have to use all 35 criteria, to change you edit the evaluation prompt (prompt 1).\n\n# How To Use It (Step-by-step)\n\n1. Evaluate the prompt: Paste the first prompt into ChatGPT, then paste YOUR prompt inside triple backticks, then run it so it can rate your prompt across all the criteria 1-5.\n   \n2.

As AI models become increasingly powerful, the gap between novice and expert prompt engineers continues to widen. Here are the ten fundamental pillars that define true mastery in this rapidly evolving field.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **1. Mastering the Art of Contextual Layering**\n\n\u2756 *The Foundation of Advanced Prompting*\n\nContextual layering is the practice of building complex, multi-dimensional context through iterative additions of information. Think of it as constructing a knowledge architecture where each layer adds depth and specificity to your intended outcome.\n\nEffective layering involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Progressive context building**: Starting with core objectives and gradually adding supporting information\n\n\u25c7 **Strategic integration**: Carefully connecting external sources (transcripts, studies, documents) to your current context\n\n\u25c7 **Purposeful accumulation**: Each layer serves the ultimate goal, building toward a specific endpoint\n\nThe key insight is that how you introduce and connect these layers matters enormously. A YouTube transcript becomes exponentially more valuable when you explicitly frame its relevance to your current objective rather than simply dumping the content into your prompt.\n\n**Example Application**: Instead of immediately asking for a complex marketing strategy, layer in market research, competitor analysis, target audience insights, and brand guidelines across multiple iterations, building toward that final strategic request.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **2. Assumption Management and Model Psychology**\n\n\u2756 *Understanding the Unspoken Communication*\n\nEvery prompt carries implicit assumptions, and skilled prompt engineers develop an intuitive understanding of how models interpret unstated context. This psychological dimension of prompting requires both technical knowledge and empathetic communication skills.\n\nMaster-level assumption management includes:\n\n\u25c7 **Predictive modeling**: Anticipating what the AI will infer from your wording\n\n\u25c7 **Assumption validation**: Testing your predictions through iterative refinement\n\n\u25c7 **Token optimization**: Using fewer tokens when you're confident about model assumptions\n\n\u25c7 **Risk assessment**: Balancing efficiency against the possibility of misinterpretation\n\nThis skill develops through extensive interaction with models, building a mental database of how different phrasings and structures influence AI responses. It's part art, part science, and requires constant calibration.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **3. Perfect Timing and Request Architecture**\n\n\u2756 *Knowing When to Ask for What You Really Need*\n\nExpert prompt engineers develop an almost musical sense of timing\u2014knowing exactly when the context has been sufficiently built to make their key request. This involves maintaining awareness of your ultimate objective while deliberately building toward a threshold where you're confident of achieving the caliber of output you're aiming for.\n\nKey elements include:\n\n\u25c7 **Objective clarity**: Always knowing your end goal, even while building context\n\n\u25c7 **Contextual readiness**: Recognizing when sufficient foundation has been laid\n\n\u25c7 **Request specificity**: Crafting precise asks that leverage all the built-up context\n\n\u25c7 **System thinking**: Designing prompts that work within larger workflows\n\nThis connects directly to layering\u2014you're not just adding context randomly, but building deliberately toward moments of maximum leverage.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **4. The 50-50 Principle: Subject Matter Expertise**\n\n\u2756 *Your Knowledge Determines Your Prompt Quality*\n\nPerhaps the most humbling aspect of advanced prompting is recognizing that your own expertise fundamentally limits the quality of outputs you can achieve. The \"50-50 principle\" acknowledges that roughly half of prompting success comes from your domain knowledge.\n\nThis principle encompasses:\n\n\u25c7 **Collaborative learning**: Using AI as a learning partner to rapidly acquire necessary knowledge\n\n\u25c7 **Quality recognition**: Developing the expertise to evaluate AI outputs meaningfully\n\n\u25c7 **Iterative improvement**: Your growing knowledge enables better prompts, which generate better outputs\n\n\u25c7 **Honest assessment**: Acknowledging knowledge gaps and addressing them systematically\n\nThe most effective prompt engineers are voracious learners who use AI to accelerate their acquisition of domain expertise across multiple fields.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **5. Systems Architecture and Prompt Orchestration**\n\n\u2756 *Building Interconnected Prompt Ecosystems*\n\nSystems are where prompt engineering gets serious. You're not just working with individual prompts anymore\u2014you're building frameworks where prompts interact with each other, where outputs from one become inputs for another, where you're guiding entire workflows through series of connected interactions. This is about seeing the bigger picture of how everything connects together.\n\nSystem design involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Workflow mapping**: Understanding how different prompts connect and influence each other\n\n\u25c7 **Output chaining**: Designing prompts that process outputs from other prompts\n\n\u25c7 **Agent communication**: Creating frameworks for AI agents to interact effectively\n\n\u25c7 **Scalable automation**: Building systems that can handle varying inputs and contexts\n\nMastering systems requires deep understanding of all other principles\u2014assumption management becomes critical when one prompt's output feeds into another, and timing becomes essential when orchestrating multi-step processes.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **6. Combating the Competence Illusion**\n\n\u2756 *Staying Humble in the Face of Powerful Tools*\n\nOne of the greatest dangers in prompt engineering is the ease with which powerful tools can create an illusion of expertise. AI models are so capable that they make everyone feel like an expert, leading to overconfidence and stagnated learning.\n\nMaintaining appropriate humility involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Continuous self-assessment**: Regularly questioning your actual skill level\n\n\u25c7 **Failure analysis**: Learning from mistakes and misconceptions\n\n\u25c7 **Peer comparison**: Seeking feedback from other skilled practitioners\n\n\u25c7 **Growth mindset**: Remaining open to fundamental changes in your approach\n\nThe most dangerous prompt engineers are those who believe they've \"figured it out.\" The field evolves too rapidly for anyone to rest on their expertise.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **7. Hallucination Detection and Model Skepticism**\n\n\u2756 *Developing Intuition for AI Deception*\n\nAs AI outputs become more sophisticated, the ability to detect inaccuracies, hallucinations, and logical inconsistencies becomes increasingly valuable. This requires both technical skills and domain expertise.\n\nEffective detection strategies include:\n\n\u25c7 **Structured verification**: Building verification steps into your prompting process\n\n\u25c7 **Domain expertise**: Having sufficient knowledge to spot errors immediately\n\n\u25c7 **Consistency checking**: Looking for internal contradictions in responses\n\n\u25c7 **Source validation**: Always maintaining healthy skepticism about AI claims\n\nThe goal isn't to distrust AI entirely, but to develop the judgment to know when and how to verify important outputs.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **8. Model Capability Mapping and Limitation Awareness**\n\n\u2756 *Understanding What AI Can and Cannot Do*\n\nThe debate around AI capabilities is often unproductive because it focuses on theoretical limitations rather than practical effectiveness. The key question becomes: does the system accomplish what you need it to accomplish?\n\nPractical capability assessment involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Empirical testing**: Determining what works through experimentation rather than theory\n\n\u25c7 **Results-oriented thinking**: Prioritizing functional success over technical purity\n\n\u25c7 **Adaptive expectations**: Adjusting your approach based on what actually works\n\n\u25c7 **Creative problem-solving**: Finding ways to achieve goals even when models have limitations\n\nThe key insight is that sometimes things work in practice even when they \"shouldn't\" work in theory, and vice versa.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **9. Balancing Dialogue and Prompt Perfection**\n\n\u2756 *Understanding Two Complementary Approaches*\n\nBoth iterative dialogue and carefully crafted \"perfect\" prompts are essential, and they work together as part of one integrated approach. The key is understanding that they serve different functions and excel in different contexts.\n\nThe dialogue game involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Context building through interaction**: Each conversation turn can add layers of context\n\n\u25c7 **Prompt development**: Building up context that eventually becomes snapshot prompts\n\n\u25c7 **Long-term context maintenance**: Maintaining ongoing conversations and using tools to preserve valuable context states\n\n\u25c7 **System setup**: Using dialogue to establish and refine the frameworks you'll later systematize\n\nThe perfect prompt game focuses on:\n\n\u25c7 **Professional reliability**: Creating consistent, repeatable outputs for production environments\n\n\u25c7 **System automation**: Building prompts that work independently without dialogue\n\n\u25c7 **Agent communication**: Crafting instructions that other systems can process reliably\n\n\u25c7 **Efficiency at scale**: Avoiding the time cost of dialogue when you need predictable results\n\nThe reality is that prompts often emerge as snapshots of dialogue context. You build up understanding and context through conversation, then capture that accumulated wisdom in standalone prompts. Both approaches are part of the same workflow, not competing alternatives.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **10. Adaptive Mastery and Continuous Evolution**\n\n\u2756 *Thriving in a Rapidly Changing Landscape*\n\nThe AI field evolves at unprecedented speed, making adaptability and continuous learning essential for maintaining expertise. This requires both technical skills and psychological resilience.\n\nAdaptive mastery encompasses:\n\n\u25c7 **Rapid model adoption**: Quickly understanding and leveraging new AI capabilities\n\n\u25c7 **Framework flexibility**: Updating your mental models as the field evolves\n\n\u25c7 **Learning acceleration**: Using AI itself to stay current with developments\n\n\u25c7 **Community engagement**: Participating in the broader prompt engineering community\n\n\u25c7 **Mental organization**: Maintaining focus and efficiency despite constant change\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n**The Integration Challenge**\n\nThese ten pillars don't exist in isolation\u2014mastery comes from integrating them into a cohesive approach that feels natural and intuitive. The most skilled prompt engineers develop almost musical timing, seamlessly blending technical precision with creative intuition.\n\nThe field demands patience for iteration, tolerance for ambiguity, and the intellectual honesty to acknowledge when you don't know something. Most importantly, it requires recognizing that in a field evolving this rapidly, yesterday's expertise becomes tomorrow's baseline.\n\nAs AI capabilities continue expanding, these foundational principles provide a stable framework for growth and adaptation. Master them, and you'll be equipped not just for today's challenges, but for the inevitable transformations ahead.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n*The journey from casual AI user to expert prompt engineer is one of continuous discovery, requiring both technical skill and fundamental shifts in how you think about communication, learning, and problem-solving. These ten pillars provide the foundation for that transformation.*\n\n**A Personal Note**\n\nThis post reflects my own experience and thinking about prompt engineering\u2014my thought process, my observations, my approach to this field. I'm not presenting this as absolute truth or claiming this is definitively how things should be done. These are simply my thoughts and perspectives based on my journey so far.\n\nThe field is evolving so rapidly that what works today might change tomorrow. What makes sense to me might not resonate with your experience or approach. Take what's useful, question what doesn't fit, and develop your own understanding. The most important thing is finding what works for you and staying curious about what you don't yet know.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n**&lt;prompt.architect&gt;**\n\n\\-Track development:\u00a0[\n\n\\-You follow me and like what I do? then this is for you:\u00a0[Ultimate Prompt Evaluator\u2122 | Kai\\_ThoughtArchitect](\n\n**&lt;/prompt.architect&gt;**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kth4nx/the_10_pillars_of_prompt_engineering_mastery/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump threatens Apple with a 25% tariff if it doesn\u2019t build iPhones in America", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/23/economy/trump-threatens-tariff-apple", "author": "None"}, {"title": "SnapNote: One-Time Note Generator (first MERN app!)", "summary": "[\n\nfirst time learning full-stack development using MERN stack! it's rather basic but I'm a true beginner. would love to hear your thoughts \ud83e\udd17\n\n", "link": "https://i.redd.it/ymdtaoishk2f1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Image of dead \u2018white farmers\u2019 came from Congo, not South Africa", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/22/africa/south-africa-white-farmers-trump-congo-intl-latam", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lahore Air Traffic Control refused IndiGo Delhi-Srinagar pilot's request to enter airspace &amp; avoid hailstorm", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lahore-atc-refused-indigo-delhi-srinagar-pilot-request-to-enter-airspace-avoid-turbulence-sources/articleshow/121345348.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Countering Pakistan isn't India's only challenge.
