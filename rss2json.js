The ministry said that it would begin a \u201cgradual termination\u201d this year as medical workers complete their missions.\n\nThe ministry said that the change was based on \u201ca technical analysis\u201d aimed at strengthening Guatemala\u2019s national health care system and \u201cguaranteeing the continuity of services.\u201d\n\nUnder President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, Guatemala has cooperated with the Trump administration, recently striking [a reciprocal trade]( deal with the United States, accepting [more]( deportation flights and [working more]( closely with U.S. law enforcement authorities on prison and gang issues.\n\nSince U.S. forces captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela last month, however, President Trump has [turned his attention to Cuba]( which provided many doctors to Venezuela and received oil from Venezuela, its largest supplier.\n\nThe Trump administration has pressured countries in the region to end the Cuban medical brigades.

Join us\u201d, appeared in public places in Poland\u2019s two largest cities.\n\nProsecutors said at the time that the men were promised up to 500,000 roubles (\u20ac5,437) for the operation and planned to leave Poland afterwards.\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private military company with close ties to the Kremlin and is known for its involvement in conflicts in Ukraine, Syria and parts of Africa.\n\nPoland has long viewed the group as a security threat, particularly after its role in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, reports of attempts to recruit operatives in Europe, and its\u00a0[activity in Belarus]( including\u00a0[near the Polish border](\n\nDuring the investigation, the defendants pleaded not guilty to recruitment and espionage, while acknowledging responsibility for distributing the stickers. Defence lawyers argued there was insufficient evidence of deliberate intelligence activity and sought acquittals.\n\nIn a first-instance ruling last February, Krak\u00f3w\u2019s district court found the materials served both recruitment and propaganda purposes as part of what prosecutors described as Russian\u2019s \u201chybrid war\u201d against Poland. It handed them each five-and-a-half-year prison terms.\n\nBoth the defence and prosecutors appealed the original ruling, with prosecutors seeking tougher eight-year sentences and the defence seeking acquittal.\n\nIn his oral justification for a ruling issed on Monday,\u00a0appeal court judge Jacek Pola\u0144ski said the lower court had correctly assessed the evidence, reports news service InfoSecurity24.\n\n\u201cIt was not just an appeal to join the Wagner Group, but there was also a QR code that took you to a website where you could find specific positions that you could apply for. It was not just agitation, but a specific indication of how to join the Wagner Group,\u201d the judge emphasised.\n\nHe rejected defence claims that the group, which in June 2023 rebelled against the Kremlin, no longer existed at the time and he agreed with the lower court\u2019s finding that the defendants were acting on behalf of Russian intelligence, saying their actions were consistent with efforts to destabilise Poland.\n\nAlthough the ruling is now legally binding, both the defendants and prosecutors can still file a final so-called cassation appeal to the Supreme Court if they wish. Broadcaster Polsat reports that both sides will first read the court\u2019s written explanation before deciding on further steps.\n\nProsecutor Tomasz Dudek called the outcome a success for law enforcement and also \u201ca success for Polish society, which remained vigilant in this situation of war on the eastern border and immediately notified the authorities after discovering these criminal leaflets and stickers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to this, it was possible to quickly identify and remove these leaflets and apprehend the perpetrators,\u201d he added.\n\nSince the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has repeatedly accused Moscow of carrying out various \u201chybrid activities\u201d on its territory consisting of\u00a0[sabotage](\u00a0[cyberattacks](\u00a0and\u00a0[disinformation]( It has detained, charged and convicted dozens of agents accused of carrying out such actions.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/10/polish-court-upholds-jail-sentences-for-russian-wagner-group-recruiters/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mindich's sister lives in Moscow flat owned by Russian general close to Putin, journalists say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/11/8020567/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland criticises head of Ukrainian state history institute for downplaying WWII massacres", "summary": "Poland\u2019s state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) has criticised the head of its Ukrainian counterpart after he called the Volhynia massacres, in which around 100,000 Poles were killed by Ukrainian nationalists, part of a \u201cPolish grand narrative\u201d.\n\nHe also said that they are viewed in Ukraine as a \u201clocal historical episode\u201d and suggested they did not constitute a genocide, as Poland believes.\n\nThe clash marks the latest episode in a long-running dispute over how to assess the history of the massacres, which took place during World War Two. The issue has regularly caused tension between two otherwise close allies, though recent times have also seen progress towards reconciliation.\n\n  \nOn Tuesday, media outlet Ukrainska Pravda\u00a0[published](\u00a0a wide-ranging interview with Oleksandr Alferov, who was appointed as head of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory (UINM) in June last year. One of the issues he spoke about extensively was the Volhynia massacres.\n\nAsked if there was a chance for the issue to be removed from political debate and left to academics to discuss, Alferov said that this was \u201cunfortunately unlikely\u201d because \u201cthe Volhynia tragedy is one of Poland\u2019s state myths\u201d.\n\nHe then appeared to correct himself, saying it was \u201cnot a myth, but one of the key elements of the Polish grand narrative\u201d.\n\nBy contrast, \u201cfor most Ukrainians, this is just a local episode of history, because it was only in Volhynia, and the Poles who left later settled throughout Poland\u201d, explained Alferov. Volhynia is a historic region located in what is now northwestern Ukraine, southeastern Poland, and southwestern Belarus.\n\n  \nDuring the Volhynia massacres, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), a partisan formation still celebrated by many in today\u2019s Ukraine, killed ethnic Poles in areas the UPA wanted to be part of a Ukrainian state.\n\nThe majority of victims were women and children, and the massacres were often carried out with particular brutality. Poland has officially recognised the episode as a genocide. However, Ukraine rejects that designation.\n\nIn his interview, Alferov pointed to historical research showing that \u201cover 28,000 Ukrainians were also killed in this conflict \\[with Poles\\]\u201d.
