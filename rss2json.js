No APIs, no setup, works right away.\n\n\u2022\tSmarter mode: Add small BERT or ONNX models (80\u2013400MB, HuggingFace) and Manx starts understanding concepts instead of just keywords.\n\n\u2022\t\u201cauth\u201d = \u201clogin\u201d = \u201csecurity middleware.\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u201creact component optimization\u201d finds useMemo, \nuseCallback, memoization patterns.\n\n\u2022\tRAG mode: Index your own stuff (files, directories, PDFs, wikis) or crawl official doc sites with --crawl.
