Not a cheat code. A teammate.\n\n**1. What This Actually Is**\n\nThis guide is a repeatable loop for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, writing tests, and understanding WTF your program is doing. It\u2019s for beginners, solo devs, and anyone who wants to build smarter with fewer rabbit holes.\n\n**2. My Settings (Optional but Helpful)**\n\nIf you can tweak the model settings:\n\n* **Temperature:** 0.15 \u2192 for clean boilerplate 0.35 \u2192 for smarter refactors 0.7 \u2192 for brainstorming/API design\n* **Top-p:** Stick with 0.9, or drop to 0.6 if you want really focused answers.\n* **Deliberate Mode:** true = better diagnosis, more careful thinking.\n\n**3. The Dev Loop I Follow**\n\nHere\u2019s the rhythm that works for me:\n\n**Paste broken code \u2192 Ask GPT \u2192 Get fix + tests \u2192 Run \u2192 Iterate if needed**\n\nGPT will:\n\n* Spot the bug\n* Suggest a patch\n* Write a pytest block\n* Explain what changed\n* Show you what passed or failed\n\nBasically what a senior engineer would do when you ask: \u201cHey, can you take a look?\u201d\n\n**4. Quick Example**\n\n**Step 1: Paste this into your terminal**\n\n    cat &gt; busted.py &lt;&lt;'PY'\n    def safe_div(a, b): return a / b  # breaks on divide-by-zero\n    PY\n\n**Step 2: Ask GPT**\n\n&gt;\u201cFix [busted.py]( to handle divide-by-zero. Add a pytest test.\u201d\n\n**Step 3: Run the tests**\n\n    pytest -q\n\n**You\u2019ll probably get:**\n\n     def safe_div(a, b):\n    -    return a / b\n    +    if b == 0:\n    +        return None\n    +    return a / b\n\nAnd something like:\n\n    import pytest\n    from busted import safe_div\n    \n    def test_safe_div():\n        assert safe_div(10, 2) == 5\n        assert safe_div(10, 0) is None\n\n**5. The Prompt I Use Every Time**\n\n    ROLE: You are a senior engineer.  \n    CONTEXT: [Paste your code \u2014 around 40\u201380 lines \u2014 plus any error logs]  \n    TASK: Find the bug, fix it, and add unit tests.  \n    FORMAT: Git diff + test block.\n\nDon\u2019t overcomplicate it. GPT\u2019s better when you give it the right framing.\n\n**6. Power Moves**\n\nThese are phrases I use that get great results:\n\n* \u201cExplain lines 20\u201360 like I\u2019m 15.\u201d\n* \u201cWrite edge-case tests using Hypothesis.\u201d\n* \u201cRefactor to reduce cyclomatic complexity.\u201d\n* \u201cReview the diff you gave. Are there hidden bugs?\u201d\n* \u201cAdd logging to help trace flow.\u201d\n\nGPT responds well when you ask like a teammate, not a genie.\n\n**7. My Debugging Loop (Mental Model)**\n\n**Trace \u2192 Hypothesize \u2192 Patch \u2192 Test \u2192 Review \u2192 Merge**\n\n    Trace ----&gt; Hypothesize ----&gt; Patch ----&gt; Test ----&gt; Review ----&gt; Merge\n      ||            ||             ||          ||           ||          ||\n      \\/            \\/             \\/          \\/           \\/          \\/\n    [Find Bug]  [Guess Cause]  [Fix Code]  [Run Tests]  [Check Risks]  [Commit]\n\nThat\u2019s it. Keep it tight, keep it simple. Every language, every stack.\n\n**8. If You Want to Get Better**\n\n* Learn basic pytest\n* Understand how git diff works\n* Try ChatGPT inside VS Code (seriously game-changing)\n* Build little tools and test them like you\u2019re pair programming with someone smarter\n\n**Final Note**\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a 10x dev. You just need momentum.\n\nThis flow helps you move faster with fewer dead ends.\n\nWhether you\u2019re debugging, building, or just trying to learn without the overwhelm\u2026\n\n**Let GPT be your second engineer, not your crutch.**\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1knmvqt/how_i_use_chatgpt_like_a_senior_engineer_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open source Wakatime alternative for code time tracking", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/0PandaDEV/Ziit", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
