Calibrating supervised models is pretty straightforward, I was wondering if there are works on calibrating pre-trained LLMs. If I have a biased dataset with a prior, how would I make the LLM aware of that. Prompting is certainly a way, I was wondering if there are other ways. Any resources /work on this would be appreciated.

During data preprocessing, I set the labels of all tokens that are not part of a target word to -100. During training, the data is processed through\u00a0DataCollatorForTokenClassification\u00a0and passed to\u00a0BertForTokenClassification. Intuitively, this should work because the loss is calculated only for the target words. Am I right?\n\nI have also tried customizing the BERT model to extract an embedding (sum/mean of the last four hidden states of the target words) and use it for classification, with similar results.\n\nMy main question is: Is my approach correct?
