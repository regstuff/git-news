Vapi seems to be the best, but all the bugs make it unusable, and their reputation for support isn\u2019t great. It\u2019s what I use in production.

It\u2019s the best performance of any I\u2019ve seen thus far\u2014but I haven\u2019t gotten too deep in functionality or edge cases. \n\nI'm curious if anyone here has been playing around with Deepgram's Voice Agent. Granted, my use case will involve Twilio.\n\nSpecifically, I'd love to hear your experiences and feedback on:\n\n * Multi-Agent Architectures: Has anyone successfully built voice agents with Deepgram that involve multiple agents working together? How did you approach this?\n * Complex Function Calling &amp; Workflows: For those of you building more sophisticated agents, have you implemented intricate function calls or agent workflows to handle various scenarios and dynamic prompting? What were the challenges and successes?\n * General Deepgram Voice Agent Feedback: Any general thoughts, pros, cons, or \"gotchas\" when working with Deepgram for voice agents?\n\nI wouldn't call myself a professional developer, nor am I a voice AI expert, but I do have a good amount of practical experience in the field.
