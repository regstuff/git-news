I could technically swap this out for a card with 4GB but I'm not sure if it's worth the cost (I'm limited to a single slot card so the options are limited if you're on a budget).\n\nFrom what I'm seeing online from benchmarks, it seems like I would either need to run the tiny, base, or small model on some of the alternate implementations to fit within 2GB or 4GB or I could use the distilled or turbo large models which I assume would give better results than the tiny, base, or small models.  However, if I do use the distilled or turbo models which seem to fit within 2GB when using integer math instead of floating point math, it would seem like there is no point in spending money to go up to 4GB, since the only thing that seems to allow is the use of floating point math with the distilled or turbo models which apparently doesn't actually impact the accuracy because of how these models are designed.

No, that was a mere coincidence. Nop. Some wonder if it is due to Waqf. Nop.\n\nThe real reason is the India-Saudi deal. This attack happened just hours before Saudi Crown prince and our PM met just in time for this to make news headlines. This has parallels to Gaza attacking Israel just before Israel-Saudi deal of normalization.\n\nAmong all the deals, including many economic deals, Saudi Arabia was also looking for a defense partner. They no longer trust US after Biden froze many of the military sales to Saudi from 2021. This makes US an untrustworthy ally. So, Saudi wants to diversify their military infrastructure. And India and China are kind of the only options.\n\nSaudi Arabia had given extra ordinary welcome to Indian PM with fighter jets accompanying his plane and 21 gun salute. It looked like Saudi was expecting to make some big deal. So, this is Pakistan's way to bring that Kashmir issue to the table and show their displeasure in the close ties Saudi is trying to have with India.\n\nSaudi has a well known hesitancy to make deals if such issues are brought forward. You can see the Israel-Saudi normalization was cancelled and remains so even 2 years after the incident.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1k5u44f/this_is_the_goal_of_pahalgam_terrorist_attack/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Radiocarbon dating reveals Mongolia's earliest pottery predates previous estimates by 2,000 years", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-04-radiocarbon-dating-reveals-mongolia-earliest.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel shares, then deletes, condolences over pope's death", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-shares-then-deletes-condolences-over-popes-death-2025-04-22/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gunmen open fire on tourists in Himalayan region, killing at least 26 people, police say | CNN", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Frescoes Discovered at Pompeii", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-rome/new-frescoes-discovered-at-pompeii/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Could China be involved behind the scenes in Pahalgam to slow India down during this trade war?", "summary": "We all know the Pakistan Army has a habit of stirring trouble in Kashmir to shift focus away from their own mess: Balochistan, rising inflation, internal protests.

Not directly, but maybe quietly encouraging Pakistan, perhaps funding some groups, giving a small signal maybe? Also, China is famous for playing these long games, using indirect ways \u2013 like cyber attacks, starting small fights at the border, using their money power, and all that stuff.\n\nAlso, India is little bit moving forward in world trade and business these days. So, if someone wants to slow India down, what\u2019s an easy way? Create trouble inside our country, distract everyone, make us waste our energy and money on these problems, right?\n\nCoincidence? Maybe.
