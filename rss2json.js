The meeting was also attended by other senior figures from the Hungarian opposition as well as Polish foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski.\n\n\u201cMr Magyar requested this meeting,\u201d Tusk told reporters while on his way to Munich. \u201cHe is particularly interested in rebuilding relations with Poland, and I am also interested in that.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, the Hungarian opposition leader wrote on social media that he and Tusk had \u201cagreed that, immediately following the change of government, we will rebuild political, economic, and cultural relations between Hungary and Poland\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, senior figures from PiS, including former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, have endorsed Orb\u00e1n, just as the Hungarian prime minister last year\u00a0[expressed support](\u00a0for the PiS-backed Polish presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki.\n\nZiobro is\u00a0[accused](\u00a0of committing a variety of crimes, including leading a criminal group, abusing his powers and approving the unlawful purchase of Pegasus spyware, when he served as justice minister in the PiS-led government from 2015 to 2023.\n\nIf found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison. However, Ziobro denies the offences and claims to be a victim of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d against him by Tusk\u2019s government.\n\nIn October, the Polish government\u2019s majority in parliament\u00a0[approved the lifting of Ziobro\u2019s immunity](\u00a0from prosecution.
