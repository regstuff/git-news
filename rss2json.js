Meanwhile, we now have semantic-based metrics (SemDist, BERTScore-style approaches, etc.) that could be more suitable.\n\nIn machine translation, the community often use other metrics than BLEU thanks to shared tasks that looked at correlation with human judgments. Maybe it would be interesting to do it also in ASR?\n\nThat's why I\u2019m trying to create a dataset that would let us compare ASR metrics against human perception in a systematic way.

He says the bill was \u201cpractically identical\u201d to the one he previously\u00a0[blocked\u00a0]( December.\n\n\u201cI will not sign a bad law just because it was passed again by the parliamentary majority \u2013 a bad law passed a hundred times is still a bad law,\u201d said Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition. \u201cPoland should attract innovation, not push it away.\u201d\n\nThe government has argued that the legislation will help protect users of crypto-assets from fraud.\n\nIt also says that the measures are necessary for national security, given Russian involvement in crypto markets and the fact that Moscow uses cryptocurrencies to\u00a0[pay operatives carrying out sabotage in Poland](\n\nThe ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right, can attempt to overturn the veto, as it\u00a0[did last time]( But such an attempt would again likely fail, as the government lacks the three-fifths majority in parliament required to overrule the president.\n\nThe bill aimed to help Poland comply with the EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by designating Poland\u2019s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) as the body responsible for overseeing the industry.\n\nAfter the government failed to overturn Nawrocki\u2019s first veto in December, parliament introduced an amendment to the new bill that lowered the maximum fee charged by the KNF for overseeing the industry, from 0.4% of firms\u2019 revenue to 0.1%. However, besides this amendment, the legislation was virtually unchanged.\n\nIt still required firms operating in the industry to submit information on their activities to the KNF, which would be empowered to impose sanctions if necessary. The law would also have introduced criminal liability for offences relating to crypto-assets.\n\nWhen vetoing the first bill in December, Nawrocki said that these measures are too onerous, lack transparency, and pose a \u201creal threat to the freedoms of Poles\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the veto, government spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka wrote on social media: \u201cIf anyone loses their savings due to a lack of regulation and oversight, political responsibility falls squarely on the presidential palace.\u201d\n\nIn response, Nawrocki\u2019s chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, told Sz\u0142apka that, \u201cwith his first veto, the president gave you the chance to improve this bad law\u2026The responsibility is yours\u201d. He noted that Nawrocki has expressed his openness to working with the government on a new, better bill.\n\nHowever, foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski said that Nawrocki had not fulfilled his promise to present a crypto-regulation bill of his own. He sarcastically accused the president of showing \u201ctouching loyalty towards sponsors, both foreign and domestic\u201d, referring to claims that Polish conservatives have ties to crypto firms.\n\nInterior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski on Friday told broadcaster RMF that the ruling coalition would not stop in its attempts to regulate the crypto market, but he did not specify what steps would be taken.\n\nPreviously, deputy finance minister Jurand Drop has warned that, if Poland does not designate an authority to oversee the crypto market by 1 July 2026, firms will not be able to register in Poland and will instead move to other EU countries, resulting in lower tax revenues for the state.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/13/president-again-vetoes-government-bill-on-regulating-crypto-assets-market-in-poland/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\udc4bk", "summary": "", "link": "/r/burp_huh/comments/1r5x8ms/k/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
