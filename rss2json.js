Article translated in comments ", "summary": "The small excavation trowel gently scrapes away the soil from a slight mound of iron objects.\nArchaeologists from Vejlemuseerne are immersed in the past while thousands of cars speed by on the E45 highway near Hedensted.\n\nAs part of the motorway expansion, a large Iron Age village has been unearthed. What makes it particularly special is the discovery of a massive sacrificial deposit of war equipment dating back approximately 1,600 years.\nThe items were buried in postholes where houses once stood: over 100 lances and spears, eight swords, arrowheads, knives, an axe, and a very valuable chainmail.\n\nThere is so much weaponry that it could have equipped an army of 80-100 warriors, along with about ten officers armed with swords.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fantastic to be part of this excavation and to hold these artifacts in my hands.\u201d\nELIAS WITTE THOMASEN, ARCHAEOLOGIST AND EXCAVATION LEADER, VEJLEMUSEERNE\n\nElias Witte Thomasen, the lead archaeologist for the excavation, explains that there was also a leader who wore chainmail and a neck ring symbolizing power and influence.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fantastic to be part of this excavation and to hold these artifacts in my hands,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-career experience. It\u2019s a tremendous privilege.\u201d\n\nThe find dates back to the 400s, a time when Germanic tribes were fighting among themselves, according to Witte Thomasen.\n\nA Powerful Chieftain with Chainmail Lived Here\n\nThe weapons were found in an Iron Age village inhabited from around 0 to 450 CE by a powerful chieftain.\n\nDuring those years, the settlement grew, creating a so-called cultural layer made up of discarded items such as slaughter waste, pottery, production scraps, and lost objects like dress pins.\n\n\t\u201cWe know that in 400 CE, some people here in the Iron Age had the capacity to gather men around them and go off to participate in warfare,\u201d says Witte Thomasen.\n\nOne of the most unique finds is a chainmail, reserved for the absolute elite. It was extremely costly to produce in the Iron Age because it required significant time and resources.\n\n\t\u201cWe know of about 13 chainmails, all found in bogs or graves. This is the first time one has been found in a settlement,\u201d Witte Thomasen explains.\n\nEvidence of a Powerful Chieftain\n\nArchaeologists also discovered parts of an oath ring, suggesting that a powerful chieftain lived in the Iron Age village. Alongside the extensive weapon sacrifices, they found pieces of at least two distinctive bronze neck rings\u2014symbols of power and influence, likely part of a chieftain\u2019s personal equipment.\n\nInsight into Iron Age Society\n\nThe weapons were placed in the postholes where buildings once stood, either during the construction of the houses or when the houses were abandoned. Archaeologists believe the weapons may have been war spoils won by the chieftain in battle or the army\u2019s own weapons, sacrificed in gratitude for victory in war. Further research will reveal more.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s quite unique, and it offers significant insight into Iron Age societal structure. Now we know that the absolute elite lived here, which we didn\u2019t know before,\u201d says Witte Thomasen.\n\nAccording to the archaeologist, this excavation is exceptional. Few places in Denmark have yielded such large weapon deposits in settlements. This tells a story of local chieftains in the Iron Age who held authority over larger communities.\n\nVejlemuseerne is planning to display parts of this significant find at the Cultural Museum in Vejle starting in early 2025.", "link": "https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/sensationelt-fund-af-vaaben-til-en-mindre-jernalderhaer-gravet-ud-ved-hedensted", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Roman Emperor Nero found a boy named Sporus, who looked Like his deceased Wife, so he had him Castrated, put in female attire, and made his entire Court play along.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.historydefined.net/sporus/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mirc script with bot that does Google Translate &amp; ASCII weather + Mario NES and a pixel editor", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/OpenSourceTreasure/Mirc-ASCII-weather-translate-pixel-editor", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Read the caption for the full story", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/jjzgsgqcs82e1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI start-up Genmo has released its Mochi 1 video model as an open source version.

Public Estimation is AMCA will be ready to be inducted into airforce by 2035.  \nMeanwhile, China already has J-20(5th gen) along with J-35(5th gen) which is in testing phase since 2021 and will be soon inducted. Let's put china aside. PAKISTAN is a potential importer of J-35. they might get their hands on it by 2028.  \nSo why is India so slow in developing AMCA or why aren't we looking to import something like SUKHOI-SU57(5th gen) from russia. As, F-35 from USA is not possible.  \nI believe the timeline given(2035) will also get delayed for AMCA. just FYI india wanted to buy 120+ medium multirole fighters in 2008. But delays after delays lead to scrapping it up and for god's sake due to government-government deal in 2018 we procured 36 rafales(4.5 gen). The government again re issued the deal to buy 114 medium fighter in 2018. But still there is a huge shortage of about 200-220 fighters in IAF right now.   \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1gwtq8s/why_india_is_not_importing_a_5th_gen_fighter/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Since 2009, under-five deaths from pneumonia\u2014the leading infectious killer of children\u2014have been cut in half.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/fight-against-pneumonia-5-charts", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Summarize changes between 2 Git branches - no API key required", "summary": "Repo: ", "link": "https://i.redd.it/v6u8bj4jnb2e1.gif", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MIT will make tuition free for families earning less than $200,000 a year", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/mit-tuition-financial-aid-free/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Modi\u2019s party told to take down campaign ad targeting Muslims", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.the-independent.com/asia/india/jharkhand-election-bjp-campaign-video-muslims-b2650443.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Updated] Gamified Task Manager with Data Sync, Leaderboard, and Privacy Options", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/hussaino03/QuestLog", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nicaragua's regime announced dozens of constitutional amendments yesterday that include extending President Daniel Ortega's term without elections", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.axios.com/2024/11/21/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-constitution", "author": "None"}, {"title": "mBART when fine tuned performs worse (urgent help)", "summary": "Hi , I'm fine tuning mBART-50-many-to-many-mt  on a language that is unseen in its pre training.\n\nI did a lot of background research and found that many papers discuss that fine tuning NMT models on high quality unseen data works and it gives good results. (Bleu : 10)\n\nWhen I'm trying to replicate the same. This doesn't work at all (Bleu:0.1, 5epochs) I don't know what I'm doing wrong . I've basically followed hugging face's documentation to write the code , which I verified was right after cross checking from a GitHub repo of someone who fine tuned the same model.\n\nA little more context\n\n1. The dataset consists of En-&gt;Xx sentnce pairs\n\n2. I used the auto tokenizer and used hugging face's trainer to train the model. \n\n3. As for arguments,  the important ones are LR:0.0005 , Epoch : 5 (runtime constraints) , batch :16 (memory constraints) , optim : adamW . Basically these. The loss improved from 3.3 to 0.8 after 5 epochs and Bleu 0.04 to 0.1 (don't know if this is improvement)\n\nI even tried looking into majority reasons why this could happen but I've made sure to not overlook things. The dataset quality is high. Tokenizing is proper, arguments are proper . So I'm very lost as to why this is happening. Can someone help me please.   \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1gwv2pw/mbart_when_fine_tuned_performs_worse_urgent_help/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Meloni\u2019s bluff: Italy\u2019s covert return to austerity as EU debt rules eat into health budget", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/melonis-bluff-italys-covert-return-to-austerity-as-eu-debt-rules-eat-into-health-budget/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NAACL 2025 reviews in less than 24 hours", "summary": "Reviews are to be released in less than 24 hours.
