Though they can in theory reach maximum speeds of 250 km/h, the fastest they are able to run on current Polish tracks is 200 km/h.\u00a0\n\nThe 20 planned new 320 km/h trains would run on upgraded lines between Warsaw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144 and Szczecin in Poland, as well as onwards to Berlin in Germany.\n\n\u201cJust as Pendolino trains changed Polish railways 10 years ago, in a few years high-speed trains will introduce a new quality of travel on domestic and international routes,\u201d said infrastructure minister Dariusz Klimczak at the announcement of PKP Intercity\u2019s tender.\n\nDeputy infrastructure minister Piotr Malepszak said that the tender was the start of \u201ca golden decade for the railway industry\u201d in Poland.\n\nHowever, the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party has previously criticised plans for rail speeds of 320 km/h, arguing that this effectively excludes Polish manufacturers from tenders. The former PiS government had planned speeds of up to 250 km/h.\n\nFormer PiS deputy infrastructure minister Rafa\u0142 Weber said on Tuesday that the result of the new tender will be \u201crolling stock supplied by a company that is not Polish, and that does not contribute to our economy\u201d.\n\nHe also argued that \u201cthere is no need to develop such \\[high\\] speeds in our country\u201d. A speed of 250 km/h allows faster travel while also \u201censuring access to the stops \\[in\\] medium-sized cities\u201d, said Weber, quoted by Radio Maryja.\n\nEarlier this month, former PiS culture minister Piotr Gli\u0144ski said that 320 km/h speeds were undesirable \u201cbecause people will be afraid to board such trains\u201d.\n\nPassenger numbers on Poland\u2019s rail network have been booming in recent years. In the first half of 2025, a\u00a0[record 40.4 million passengers](\u00a0travelled with PKP Intercity, which was 9% more than a year earlier and 31% more than two years ago.\n\nBy the end of this year, the figure is forecast to reach 89 million, up from 78.5 million in 2024 and 68 million in 2023.\n\nLast month, PKP Intercity\u00a0[signed the biggest contract](\u00a0for rolling stock in Polish history, ordering 42 double-decker trains \u2013 the first of their kind in Poland \u2013 in a deal worth 6.9 billion zloty (\u20ac1.6 billion). However, those trains \u2013 manufactured in Poland by Alstom \u2013 will not begin to arrive until 2029.\n\nIn order to meet current surging demand for rail travel, earlier this month PKP Intercity\u00a0[announced the purchase](\u00a0of 50 second-hand rail carriages from Germany.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/31/poland-launches-tender-for-fastest-ever-trains-capable-of-up-to-320-km-h/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Switzerland ski fire latest: 'Several dozen' believed to have been killed in Crans-Montana bar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c8xdxvj2qjdt", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adams \u2018senior member of IRA Army Council who could end violence\u2019,", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/adams-senior-member-of-ira-army-council-who-could-end-violence-foreign-secretary-told-us/a636509149.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ex deputy foreign minister to stand trial in Poland over visa corruption scandal", "summary": "Four people, including a former deputy foreign minister from the previous Law and Justice (PiS) government, have been indicted over alleged corruption in the issuing of visas. Hundreds of immigrants from Asia may have benefited from the scheme, which caused a scandal when it came to light in 2023.\n\nThe quartet, who also include two other former foreign-ministry officials, are accused of abusing their power to help people obtain Polish visas, which also provide access to the European Schengen area.\n\nIf convicted, the defendants could face maximum prison sentences of eight or 10 years. One of them has pleaded guilty, while the three others, including the former deputy minister, say they are innocent.\n\nThe so-called visa scandal\u00a0[emerged](\u00a0publicly in September 2023, shortly before parliamentary elections in which the PiS government was seeking a third term. However, the party lost its parliamentary majority and was removed from power.\n\nThe affair also prompted the resignation of the deputy foreign minister with responsibility for overseeing the consular and visa systems, who is named by prosecutors only as Piotr W. under Polish privacy law.\n\nPiotr W. is among those indicted today, accused of abusing his powers and disclosing official information to an unauthorised person. Meanwhile, his former aide, Edgar K. is facing nine charges of influence peddling.\n\nProsecutors say that Edgar K. acted as an intermediary in visa-related matters for over 600 people, in particular citizens of India, Nepal, Thailand and the Philippines, in return for which he received financial benefits totalling several hundred thousand zloty.\n\nPiotr W. then \u201caccelerated visa procedures for foreigners whose details he received from Edgar K., influencing in individual cases the content of visa decisions issued at Polish consular offices\u201d, according to prosecutors. He did not receive financial benefits for those actions.\n\nThe two other individuals indicted today are the former director and deputy director of the foreign ministry\u2019s consular department, named as Marcin J. and Beata B.\n\nThey are also accused of abusing their powers, including by \u201cexerting unlawful pressure on activities in visa matters performed by consuls and undertaking unjustified interventions to accelerate visa procedures\u201d at the behest of Piotr W.\n\nEdgar K. has pleaded guilty and provided evidence that has helped inform the charges against the other three, who have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe crimes Edgar K. is accused of carry a maximum jail sentence of eight years, while the other three could face up to ten years.\n\nIn August this year, six other people were also indicted as part of the same investigation.

All but one of them has pleaded guilty.\n\nWhen the visa scandal broke, Poland\u2019s then opposition\u00a0[argued](\u00a0that it showed how the PiS government, despite its tough anti-immigrant rhetoric, was allowing large numbers of unregulated migrants into the country.\n\nThose former opposition parties are now in power, and have overseen the investigations into the affair.
