Following six months of fighting, the AA captured Border Guard Post No. 5, forcing Myanmar military personnel and allied Rohingya militia to flee across the Naf River. While internet blackouts hinder verification, the AA\u2019s control over northern Rakhine State marks a significant step in its bid for autonomy. However, the AA\u2019s advances, including allegations of violence against the Rohingya minority, have raised concerns of renewed ethnic strife, as the group consolidates control over 11 of Rakhine\u2019s 17 townships and shifts focus to southern resistance efforts.\n\nThe Diplomat: [Ethnic Armed Group Claims Full Control of Myanmar\u2019s Border With Bangladesh]( (10 December 2024)\n\nMy analysis (and I'm open to being corrected):\n\nI believe this should be seen as a critical inflection point in Myanmar's civil war that has been spilling over across the border and creating instability in India's near east. By seizing the last junta-held post in Maungdaw, the AA has consolidated control over a strategic corridor, cutting off the Tatmadaw's (Myanmar military) access to the BD frontier. This development positions AA as the dominant force in Rakhine state's northern reaches and also reflects a shift in power dynamics. The implications for BD's political system, already in turmoil, are immediate and dire, as another wave of displaced Rohingya refugees from the Rakhine state could push the country closer to a breaking point, and straight into the lap of China. (Important to note here that the Rakhine Buddhist majority has historically viewed the Rohingya as outsiders with no legitimate claim to the land.) \n\nIt is noteworthy that AA's position within the Chinese-backed Three Brotherhood Alliance amplifies its strategic leverage. By controlling critical borderlands, the AA is indirectly serving Beijing's interests by increasing pressure on BD, a country that had been a key partner for India at least up until former PM Hasina's ouster. This control also strengthens AA's negotiating power as it fights for autonomy, leaving Naypyidaw more isolated. Conversely, it adds to China's growing arsenal of multi-front pressure points that it can use against BD to pull it closer into its orbit.\n\nGiven the above facts, New Delhi's strategic headaches are set to intensify. The Kaladan Multi-modal Transit Transport Project, a linchpin for connecting India's restive northeast to the Bay of Bengal via Myanmar's Sittwe port, now lies completely vulnerable. With the AA entrenched in Paletwa, a critical junction in the Chin state located along the Kaladan river, as well as the militia's control over a large contiguous zone within Rakhine state, directly threatens the Indian project's security.\n\nChina's strategic manoeuvring in Myanmar highlights the urgency for decisive action in the region and creates potential points of strategic convergence for the India-BD-US triangle. By opportunistically backing both insurgent groups, like the AA and the junta, Beijing has entrenched itself as a shadow power broker. This positions China to exploit Myanmar's instability for its geopolitical gains, while keeping its enemies off balance. For India, inaction risks far more than just strategic setbacks. A coordinated Chinese-backed insurgency arc could destabilise its shared borders with BD, further jeopardising India's vulnerable northeastern states and threatening the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project. Additionally, if China consolidates its influence in Myanmar, it could gain the capability to project naval power from Myanmar's coastal regions, directly undermining India's maritime security. Such a development would not only threaten India's trade routes in the Bay of Bengal, but also challenge its sovereignty and territorial control over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This potential shift in regional power would leave New Delhi grappling with the prospect of a heightened Chinese naval presence in its immediate maritime neighbourhood, further complicating its ability to maintain strategic dominance in the Indian Ocean.\n\nFrom the US perspective, China's expanding influence in Myanmar poses a direct threat to its Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy. Beijing's potential to establish a strong foothold along Myanmar's coastline in the Bay of Bengal would allow it to project power into the IOR, challenging the US-led maritime order. This convergence of risks makes it imperative for the US, India and BD to coordinate efforts to counterbalance China's growing clout, stabilise the region, and safeguard shared strategic interests.
