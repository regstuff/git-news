Despite our efforts, it\u2019s clear we have failed to foster a community for productive dialogue around geo**p**olitics.\n\nThus we have made decide to shift the focus of our sub**r**eddit to appreciating the best anime waifus and husbandos. Th**i**s decision was not made **l**ightly, but we believe that it is the best course of action to ensure that our community remains active and engaged.\n\nMoving **f**orward, we will no longer all**o**w p**o**sts related to news or po**l**itic**s**. We understand that this may be disappointing to some members of our community, but we believe that it is in the best interest of the majority. We believe that by focusing on our anime crushes, we can create a more positive and engaging environment for our members.\n\nTo ensure that our new focus is maintained, we have updated our subreddit rules. Any posts that violate these rules will be removed. The new rules are as follows:\n\n1. **Only posts related to anime waifus and husbandos are allowed now.**\n2. **Both SFW and NSFW posts are allowed, but NSFW posts must be marked as such. For NSFW posts, do not post pornographic acts.**\n3. **NSFW posts should still obey Reddit site wide rules. This means no lolis or similarly degenerate shit.**\n    \nNormal submission rules still apply. Yes we know you want to share the finest artwork of your favorite waifu to the subreddit, but we don\u2019t need to see every single image.\n\nWe hope that our community will embrace this new direction and that we can continue to grow and thrive together.

On days where I have less time, bare minimum I plan on doing Preparatory asanas and shambhavi. What other Kriya could i incorporate to increase my receptivity?\n2. Is it ok to continue doing hanuman chalisa?\n3. Is it beneficial to continue with daily isha kriya along with shambhavi or is it redundant? \n\nIn the evenings, i usually do an hour long cardio at the elliptical. I am wondering if it is good to do cardio first then sit down for shambhavi.\n\n\n4. Is daily upa yoga a good substitute for an hour of cardio?\n\nas you can see, this is a personally crafted routine. I am looking to streamline my daily routine, so that I do not feel overencombered, but organize my practices in a better way, while adding/removing certain practices.\n\n\nThis is what I am envisioning for my new morning routine, I need your help refining this routine for maximum receptivity to Shambhavi - \n\n1.

Python's nltk package uses two POS taggers, AveragedPerceptronTagger and StanfordTagger that come with pretrained weights downloaded from the nltk_data repository. If someone wishes to write their existing NLP pipeline in Rust, a POS tagger implementation is crucial.\n\n## Project\n\npostagger.rs is a rewrite of AveragedPerceptronTagger (originally in Python) and uses the same weights that the Python version uses. Alongside the Rust API, I've also produced C bindings with cbindgen and Java bindings with JNI.\n\nWriting the FFI was tricky, as it comprised of transporting custom C structs (or Java objects) across the interface. In the Java wrapper, I had to return a JSON string with the results, just to tackle the complexity of returning a custom object. This was not a problem with C, thanks to cbindgen.\n\n\nuse postagger::PerceptronTagger;\n\nfn main() {\n    let tagger = PerceptronTagger::new( \"tagger/weights.json\" , \"tagger/classes.txt\" , \"tagger/tags.json\" )  ; \n    let tags = tagger.tag( \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" ) ;\n    for tag in &amp;tags {\n        println!( \"{} {} {}\" , tag.word , tag.tag , tag.conf ) ; \n    }\n}\n\nOutput:\n\nthe DT 1\nquick JJ 1\nbrown NN 0.9741066\nfox NN 0.85340536\njumps VBZ 0.90339375\nover IN 0.9998745\nthe DT 1\nlazy JJ 0.9865011\ndog NN 0.9999973\n\nThe library is available as a crate of crates.io and\n\non GitHub: \n\nI would be glad if Rust + ML enthusiasts can collaborate on the project.
