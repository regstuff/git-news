Its population\u2014estimated to be above [31 million]( people\u2014is roughly equivalent to current wartime Ukraine and modern Texas. It is a country of sprawling mountains, dense cities, jungles, and industrial corridors where military infrastructure sits interlaced with civilian life. Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia, and other urban centers are not \u201csurgical strike zones\u201d\u2014they are vast megacities where any attempt to dismantle regime capabilities from the air risks substantial civilian casualties and cascading regional effects.\n\nA few commentators on cable news shows\u2014eager to portray potential U.S. military action as simple and manageable\u2014have taken to comparing a possible operation in Venezuela to Operation Just Cause, the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama to seize Gen. Manuel Noriega. The analogy is dangerously misleading. That\u2019s because Panama, in 1989, had a population of about 2.5 million spread over an area (75,000 sq km) smaller than the state of South Carolina. The entire country of Panama could be enveloped and dominated by a single U.S. corps-level operation, which is what occurred. And drug kingpin Noriega commanded a small, brittle, and corrupt force that collapsed almost immediately. The Panama Canal Zone gave the United States prepositioned forces, infrastructure, bases, and a finely tuned understanding of the terrain. The objectives\u2014seize Noriega, protect the canal, and dismantle the Panamanian Defense Forces\u2014were narrowly defined and achievable.\n\nVenezuela shares none of those characteristics. It is nearly thirty times larger than Panama, with ten times the population, far more complex geography, urban density orders of greater magnitude, and a regime that has spent years preparing for exactly the kind of irregular resistance the United States now risks provoking. There is no doubt that Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government is corrupt, but it also has dispersed command nodes into hardened or concealed locations, embedded military assets within civilian infrastructure, and empowered paramilitary groups capable of shifting into guerrilla warfare. No serious planner could look at a map of Venezuela and believe it resembles Panama in scale, complexity, or political risk.\n\nOnce any logical planner assesses Venezuela\u2019s true scale, the more apt comparison becomes obvious: A U.S. invasion into Venezuela would mirror the Russian miscalculation in Ukraine.", "link": "https://www.thebulwark.com/p/no-venezuela-is-not-a-small-latin-american-country", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'The worst possible situation': Tehran only has a few days of water left", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/tehran-only-has-a-few-days-of-water-left/c7u3x80ig", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thousands rally in Mexico City as 'Gen Z' protests gain momentum", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/mexico-generation-z-protest-9b0a8b1461a1ec47cce696d25e04feb5", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Clashes in Mexico City amid Gen-Z styled protests over crime and corruption", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/protest-in-mexico-inspired-by-gen-z-movement-draws-older-govt-critics", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'Nobody is pushing them to die for the sake of ruins,' Zelensky says of Pokrovsk defense", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/urkaine-war-latest-update-2025-11-13/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli Settler Attack During West Bank Olive Harvest Leads to Death of a Boy", "summary": "##Palestinians see the violence, and its tolerance by right-wing Israeli officialdom, as part of a broader campaign to harass them and make life so unbearable that they will abandon their villages.\n\nAyssam Ma\u2019ala, a happy-go-lucky eighth grader, had just laid down tarps to gather ripe olives in the West Bank town of Beita.

A good crop can keep a family afloat financially for a year, and bringing it in once meant picnics, togetherness and cookouts among the trees.\n\nThe Israeli military insists that its soldiers are under orders to allow the harvest, but activists say that the military often sides with the settlers or even tries to disrupt the harvest itself.

It does not include the right to adopt children or share custody.\n\nIt is intended as a compromise that will satisfy conservative elements in the coalition while also potentially being acceptable to Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nAfter the plans were unveiled, Nawrocki said that he would not sign any bill that \u201cundermines the unique and constitutionally protected status of marriage\u201d but that he was \u201copen to discussion\u201d about measures to \u201chelp people,\u00a0regardless of their gender, relationships, or age, to manage certain matters\u201d.\n\nKatarzyna Kotula, a secretary of state in the prime minister\u2019s office who is overseeing work on the proposal, told\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*\u00a0that \u201cthe government is putting the finishing touches to a bill \u201d and aims to submit it to parliament by the end of the year.\n\nMilosz Przepi\u00f3rkowski, a strategic partnership officer at Kampania Przeciw Homofobii (Campaign Against Homophobia), one of Poland\u2019s largest LGBT+ rights organisations, told Notes from Poland that he feels the government\u2019s proposed solutions would help with some practicalities but do not go far enough.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I\u2026got married in Berlin, and it was wonderful because we were treated like any other couple.

Many in the Russian liberal opposition, which now operates mostly in exile, unquestioningly support Israel.

Anti-Palestinian bias is a natural outcome of this worldview.\n\n&gt;Examples of the Russian opposition\u2019s virulent anti-Palestinianism abound.

In addition, Russian pop icons, comedians, musicians, and TV personalities who are based in Israel or visit also constantly broadcast the Israeli narrative.\n\n&gt;The paradox here is that the Russian liberal opposition maintains that it is the democratic, moral alternative to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s authoritarianism while openly expressing racist views against the Palestinians.

It is the second time that the court has issued a judgment against Poland relating to its near-total abortion ban.\n\nThe ECHR found that the woman\u2019s right to private and family life was violated by the legal uncertainty created by the delay between the Polish Constitutional Tribunal (TK) ruling of October 2020, which banned abortion in cases of birth defects, and its implementation by the government over three months later.\n\n\n\nThe woman, who is named only by the initials A.R., is a Polish national who lives in the city of Krak\u00f3w.
