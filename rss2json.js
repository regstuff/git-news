With a supermajority in the legislature, Mr. Bukele\u2019s party replaced judges on the Supreme Court, which then reinterpreted the country\u2019s Constitution and allowed him to run for re-election\n\nWhen authoritarian leaders consolidate power by gaining control over the judiciary or the legislature, they have a whole biased institution to rule in their favor,\n\nThe fraud doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it\u2019s a systematic and prolonged process. Authoritarian governments ask, \"do we have the judiciary? Check. Do we have the army? Check.\" They check those boxes off until they can execute the master plan.\n\n###Culling candidates.\n\nAuthoritarian governments across the world have often sought to control election outcomes by dictating which candidates can run. Mr. Maduro\u2019s government used the courts to ban the charismatic Ms. Machado from the presidential ballot, leading her party to use Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, a little-known diplomat, as a replacement.\n\nIran\u2019s repressive theocracy consolidates power and controls elections by only allowing candidates vetted by the Guardian Council, a 12-person group of jurists and clerics, to run. This year, the council disqualified multiple women, a former president and many government officials from running, whittling a list of 80 down to just six candidates who were allowed to run for president. \n\n###Creating a culture of fear.\n\nAuthoritarian governments also try to manipulate elections by striking fear in voters. In Venezuela, Mr. Maduro darkly warned of a \u201cblood bath\u201d if his party lost, a threat that bears real teeth: in 2017, National Guard troops and Maduro-aligned militias violently quelled protests against his government.\n\nIn Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin, banned public demonstrations and jailed his most prominent critic, Aleksei A. Navalny, and other opponents as a warning to those who might question his rule.\n\n###Buying votes and stuffing ballots.\n\nSome authoritarian governments buy votes to keep control. Paraguay\u2019s Colorado Party has maintained power for 70 years in part by rounding up Indigenous people and paying them to vote for the right-wing party. \n\n###Limiting outside observers.\n\nAt some Venezuelan voting stations, officials refused to provide paper tallies of votes to election monitors, prohibiting outside observers from being able verify election results at different voting sites. Mr. Maduro\u2019s government also expelled the diplomatic missions of seven Latin American countries that decried the official election announcement.\n\nIn Syria\u2019s 2014 election, President al-Assad used outside observers \u2014 but from authoritarian nations, including North Korea, Iran and Russia \u2014 to portray the voting as having been conducted legitimately.\n\n[Read a copy of the rest of the article here](", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/europe/authoritarian-governments-vote-rigging-venezuela-maduro.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
