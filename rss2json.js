I've conducted extensive and exhaustive benchmarks on LLMs for text classification tasks. Some of them imply longer inputs. Loading Llama with the Hugging Face library deals with longer prompts and behaves well in terms of memory usage. Nonetheless, it is way too slow even with the Accelerate library (I'm an extreme user and taking more than 15 seconds, depending on the input length, is prohibitive). When I use the checkpoint downloaded from Meta's website and the llama\\_models' library, it is fast and awesome for scalability in shorter inputs. However, it has out-of-memory errors with longer prompts. It seems to be a poor memory management of Torch, because the GPU has up to 80 GB available. I've had countless attempts and nothing worked (I used torch.cuda.empty\\_cache(), PYTORCH\\_CUDA\\_ALLOC\\_CONF, gc.collect(), torch.cuda.empty\\_cache(), with torch.autocast, with torch.no\\_grad(), with torch.inference\\_mode() (when reading the Llama library, it turns out they've already had it as a decorator, so I removed it), among many others. Can anyone help me out somehow?
