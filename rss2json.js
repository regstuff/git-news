Though they can in theory reach maximum speeds of 250 km/h, the fastest they are able to run on current Polish tracks is 200 km/h.\u00a0\n\nThe 20 planned new 320 km/h trains would run on upgraded lines between Warsaw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144 and Szczecin in Poland, as well as onwards to Berlin in Germany.\n\n\u201cJust as Pendolino trains changed Polish railways 10 years ago, in a few years high-speed trains will introduce a new quality of travel on domestic and international routes,\u201d said infrastructure minister Dariusz Klimczak at the announcement of PKP Intercity\u2019s tender.\n\nDeputy infrastructure minister Piotr Malepszak said that the tender was the start of \u201ca golden decade for the railway industry\u201d in Poland.\n\nHowever, the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party has previously criticised plans for rail speeds of 320 km/h, arguing that this effectively excludes Polish manufacturers from tenders. The former PiS government had planned speeds of up to 250 km/h.\n\nFormer PiS deputy infrastructure minister Rafa\u0142 Weber said on Tuesday that the result of the new tender will be \u201crolling stock supplied by a company that is not Polish, and that does not contribute to our economy\u201d.\n\nHe also argued that \u201cthere is no need to develop such \\[high\\] speeds in our country\u201d. A speed of 250 km/h allows faster travel while also \u201censuring access to the stops \\[in\\] medium-sized cities\u201d, said Weber, quoted by Radio Maryja.\n\nEarlier this month, former PiS culture minister Piotr Gli\u0144ski said that 320 km/h speeds were undesirable \u201cbecause people will be afraid to board such trains\u201d.\n\nPassenger numbers on Poland\u2019s rail network have been booming in recent years. In the first half of 2025, a\u00a0[record 40.4 million passengers](\u00a0travelled with PKP Intercity, which was 9% more than a year earlier and 31% more than two years ago.\n\nBy the end of this year, the figure is forecast to reach 89 million, up from 78.5 million in 2024 and 68 million in 2023.\n\nLast month, PKP Intercity\u00a0[signed the biggest contract](\u00a0for rolling stock in Polish history, ordering 42 double-decker trains \u2013 the first of their kind in Poland \u2013 in a deal worth 6.9 billion zloty (\u20ac1.6 billion). However, those trains \u2013 manufactured in Poland by Alstom \u2013 will not begin to arrive until 2029.\n\nIn order to meet current surging demand for rail travel, earlier this month PKP Intercity\u00a0[announced the purchase](\u00a0of 50 second-hand rail carriages from Germany.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/31/poland-launches-tender-for-fastest-ever-trains-capable-of-up-to-320-km-h/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adams \u2018senior member of IRA Army Council who could end violence\u2019,", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/adams-senior-member-of-ira-army-council-who-could-end-violence-foreign-secretary-told-us/a636509149.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
