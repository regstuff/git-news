No new data is generated artificially. If the NLP system can't allocate an entry hitting a specific confidence treshold (which is static), a default reply is selected instead. Otherwise, if the threshold is met, the entity with the hightest confidence score is returned. Now, there are two undesired scenarios: The NLP does not allocate the correct entry even though there would be one that suits the users input and returns a default reply instead (this is what I refer to as a false-negative) or it actually selects and returns an unsuitable entity even though there was no suitable entity for the specific user input (this is what I refer to as a false-positive). Now, apart from incomplete training data, the confidence treshold plays a crucial role. When set too high, the system is more prone to false-positives, when set too low, the chance for false-negatives increases. The way I see it there is an inherent dilemma of avoiding one of them on the cost of the other, the goal essentially being to find an optimal balance.  \n  \nIs there a scientific terminology, name, or preexisting research on this issue?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1l7te72/tradeoff_between_reducing_falsenegatives_vs/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "RFC6962 certificate transparency log with LSM-tree based storage", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Barre/compact_log", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jawaharlal Nehru first visit to Leh", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7rsi6", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Find indirect or deep intents for a given keyword", "summary": "I have been given a project which is intent-aware keyword expansion. Basically, for a given keyword / keyphrase, I need to find indirect / latent intents, i.e, the ones which are not immediately understandable, but the user may intend to search for it later. For example, for the keyword \u201crunning shoes\u201d, \u201cgym subscription\u201d or \u201cweight loss tips\u201d might be 2 indirect intents. Similarly, for the input keyword \u201cvehicles\u201d, \u201cinsurance\u201d may be an indirect intent since a person searching for \u201cvehicles\u201d may need to look for \u201cinsurance\u201d later. \n\nHow can I approach this project? I am allowed to use LLMs, but obviously I can\u2019t directly generate indirect intents from LLMs, otherwise there\u2019s no point of the project.\n\nI may have 2 types of datasets given to me: \n1) Dataset of keywords / keyphrases with their corresponding keyword clicks, ad clicks and revenue.

Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jameison Greer to secure a \u201chandshake\u201d agreement from Chinese officials that they would lift the measures, Hassett said.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that after the handshake, immediately after the handshake, any export controls from the U.S. will be eased, and the rare earths will be released in volume, and then we can go back to negotiating smaller matters,\u201d Hassett said on CNBC.\n\nAsked what kind of export controls the U.S. would lift, Hassett said the administration would not remove controls from the \u201cvery, very high end Nvidia stuff,\u201d such as Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip. \u201cThat would be a new thing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI'm talking about possible export controls on other semiconductors, which are also very important to them.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration was also reportedly considering lifting export restrictions on jet engines and other technologies, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Bureau of Industry and Security began restricting those items in late May through is-informed letters to individual companies (see 2505290038).\n\nHassett said the administration is focused on China\u2019s export curbs of rare earths because those exports have been \u201cgoing a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal.\u201d Trump spoke with President Xi Jinping over the phone, and Hassett said Trump asked for \u201ca handshake that you promise you're going to release these things.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so really, the purpose of the meeting today is to make sure that they're serious, but to literally get handshakes from Scott \\[Bessent\\] and Howard \\[Lutnick\\] and Jamieson \\[Greer\\], our three lead trade negotiators, and get this thing behind us,\u201d Hassett said.\n\nHe said China controls \u201csomething like 90% of the rare earths and the magnets, and if they're slow rolling\u201d those exports, \u201cthen it could potentially disrupt production for some U.S. companies that rely on those things.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the Trump administration expects the talks in London to \u201cbear fruit,\u201d Hassett said he's optimistic. \u201cI expect it to be a short meeting with a big, strong handshake, and we'll see,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that's what we're expecting.\u201d\n\nTalks between the two sides stretched into the evening hours in London.

Like, what's your real process? Are you just throwing code at AI and asking for explanations, or do you have some structured approach that's been game-changing?\n\nWould love to hear your specific workflows - which tools you use, how you prompt them, how you go from AI-assisted learning to actually building stuff that works in production. Basically anything that's helped you level up faster.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing.
