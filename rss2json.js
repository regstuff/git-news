Gen.

The behavior of FTS-Tool may be modified by changing the config files in .fts, located in the user directory. The tool is published to pypi and can be installed with the classic pip command: pip install fts-tool.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nFTS-Tool is developed for office environments to make communication and file sharing more straightforward. The tool is supposed to replace the need of uploading a temporary file to a network drive just to transfer to another computer on land. This could take longer than necessary and could clutter or stress the drive with downloading/uploading to a drive for a peer-to-peer transfer.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nFTS-Tool is simplified and to the point. It is designed to be intuitive to anyone in the work place. Not just the tech savy employees. Unlike other chat tools, Fts-Tool does not require joining chat rooms and instead has a global chat for less required setup. It also is supposed to take out the middleman in file-transfers and work peer-to-peer. As a result, Fts-tool doesn't require WAN access as it runs primarly through LAN.\n\nThe GitHub repo contains more information and also includes documentation for the use of FTS-Tool in the command line. Any feedback on the gui, intuitiveness, any user inconvenience, or features absent from a tool like this would be greatly appreciated.

We got bored of rebuilding the same agentic patterns for clients over and over, so we turned those patterns into **Pipelex**, an open-source DSL which reads like documentation + Python runtime for **repeatable AI workflows**.\n\nThink **Dockerfile/SQL for multi-step LLM pipelines**: you declare steps and interfaces; the runtime figures out how to run them with whatever model/provider you choose.\n\n**Why this vs. another workflow builder?**\n\n* **Declarative, not glue code** \u2014 describe *what* to do; the runtime orchestrates the *how*.\n* **Agent-first** \u2014 each step carries natural-language context (purpose + conceptual inputs/outputs) so LLMs can follow, audit, and optimize. We expose this via an **MCP server** so agents can *run* pipelines or even *build new ones on demand*.\n* **Open standard (MIT)** \u2014 language spec, runtime, API server, editor extensions, MCP server, and an n8n node.\n* **Composable** \u2014 a pipe can call other pipes you build or that the community shares.\n\n**Why a language?**\n\n* Keep **meaning and nuance** in a structure both humans and LLMs understand.\n* Get **determinism, control, reproducibility** that prompts alone don\u2019t deliver.\n* Bonus: editors/diffs/semantic coloring, easy sharing, search/replace, version control, linters, etc.\n\n**Quick story from the field**\n\nA finance-ops team had one mega-prompt to apply company rules to expenses: error-prone and pricey. We split it into a Pipelex workflow: extract \u2192 classify \u2192 apply policy. **Reliability jumped \\~75% \u2192 \\~98% and costs dropped \\~3\u00d7** by using a smaller model where it adds value and deterministic code for the rest.\n\n**What\u2019s in it**\n\n* Python library for local dev\n* FastAPI server + Docker image (self-host)\n* MCP server (agent integration)\n* n8n node (automation)\n* VS Code / Cursor extension (Pipelex .plx syntax)\n\n**What feedback would help most**\n\n1. Try building a small workflow for your use case: did the Pipelex (.plx) syntax help or get in the way?\n2. Agent/MCP flows and n8n node usability.\n3. Ideas for new \u201cpipe\u201d types / model integrations.\n4. OSS contributors welcome (core + shared community pipes).\n\n**Known gaps**\n\n* No \u201cconnectors\u201d buffet: we focus on cognitive steps; connect your apps via code/API, MCP, or n8n.\n* Need nicer **visualization** (flow-charts).\n* **Pipe builder** can fail on very complex briefs (working on recursive improvements).\n* No hosted API yet (self-host today).\n* Cost tracking = LLM only for now (no OCR/image costs yet).\n* Caching + reasoning options not yet supported.\n\nIf you try even a tiny workflow and tell us exactly where it hurts, that\u2019s gold.
