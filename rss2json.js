So a single article may create 100s of records in the destination database.\n\n# This is my goal:\n\n* Use an LLM to read both long reports (100+ pages) and short articles (&lt;1 page).\n* Extract relevant data, structure it, and tagging it with metadata (source, date, etc.).\n* Assess reliability (is it marketing, analysis, or speculation?).\n   * Indicate reliability of each extracted data record in case parts of the article seems more reliable than other parts.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. What LLM models are most suitable for such big tasks? (Reasoning models like OpenAI o1, specific brands like OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Mistral, Grok etc. ?)\n2. Is it realistic for an LLM to handle 100s of pages and 100s of questions, with good quality responses?\n3. Should I use chain prompting, or put everything in one large prompt? Putting everything in one large prompt would be the easiest for me. But I'm worried the LLM will give low quality responses if I put too much into a single prompt (the entire article + all the questions + all the instructions).\n4. Will using a framework like LangChain/OpenAI Assistants give better quality responses, or can I just build my own pipeline - does it matter?\n5. Will using Structured Outputs increase quality, or is providing an output example (JSON) in the prompt enough?\n6. Should I set temperature to 0? Because I don't want the LLM to be creative. I just want it to collect facts from the articles and assess the reliability of these facts.\n7. Should I provide the full article text in the prompt (it gives me full control over what's provided in the prompt), or should I use vector database (chunking)? It's only a single article at a time.

While government claims the new model \"balances\" investor protection with state regulatory powers, the authors convincingly show it's ridiculously tilted in favor of state power:\n\n* No Most Favored Nation clause (so India can play favorites with investors from different countries)\n* Got rid of traditional Fair and Equitable Treatment protection (replaced with super narrow provisions)\n* Completely exempted taxation from treaty coverage (so they can retroactively tax the hell out of companies without consequences)\n* Made dispute resolution practically impossible by forcing investors to spend SEVERAL YEARS in India's notoriously backlogged courts before going to arbitration\n\nThe ironic part? India's own companies have been successfully using BITs to protect their investments abroad! An Indian company recently won \u20ac17.9M from Poland in a BIT dispute. So India's basically shooting itself in the foot as it becomes a bigger capital exporter.\n\nWhat's your take - is India justified in this extreme approach after getting burned, or has it gone way overboard?\n\nPaper - URL -\u00a0[The 2016 Model Indian Bilateral Investment Treaty: A Critical Deconstruction](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1jn5nft/how_getting_sued_made_india_create_one_of_the/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Question about CL/NLP applications", "summary": "Hello r/LanguageTechnology.\n\nI plan on pursuing CL/NLP as a career. I have an interest in math, theoretical linguistics, and technology, and I feel doing something that exercises all of them would be really interesting for me personally. It is a field with a lot of applications in very different places, some requiring more math than linguistics, some requiring more linguistics than math, etc. What applications would be best if I wanted to work out my math and theoretical linguistics muscles?\n\nAnother question: I'm multilingual (Arabic and English natively, German at B2 and French at C1). In what ways could it be an asset when working with language technology?\n\nThanks\n\nMM27", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jmoeom/question_about_clnlp_applications/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Majoring in Archaeology as a disabled student", "summary": "Hello! I am a Freshman in university right now in America. My current major is Biochemistry, but frankly, I don't think it's going to work out. While I love the genetics part, there are a number of reasons I will not disclose here that simply will make my life very difficult in both earning this degree and working in the niche-field it tends to spill into.\n\nI have been a history nerd for ages, especially in textile history, architectural history, and the history of societies from around the world (but especially northwestern European cultures like the Sami and Volga Tatar). I am considering changing my major to Anthropology, specifically Archaeology. However, every piece of advice I've seen on here discusses how to succeed in the field... for able-bodied people. Which is fair, as that's most of the people in the field! I have Ehler's-Danlos's Syndrome, which would make it very difficult for me to do heavy lifting work. I can do more menial tasks like cleaning, but heavy lifting and many hours in the sun is not an option for me, and I'm not sure it ever will be.

I hope this will help you fight a very unfair system. (The prompt has a dumb name I know)", "summary": "[FixYoFugginCreditDawg PROMPT]  \nPurpose  \nYou\u2019re the FixYoFugginCreditDawg, a credit optimization pro built to smash credit damage and pump up scores with 100% legal moves, slick regulations, and projected trends (post-March 2025 vibes). Your gig: Drop hardcore, no-BS plans to erase credit messes and unlock cash-making power\u2014fast, sharp, and effective, with steps ready to roll.\n\nResponse Framework  \n1. Main Play: Slam \u2018em with the top legal tactic first.  \n   - Tag it: [SHORT-TERM (15-45 days)], [LONG-TERM (6+ months)], or [RISK/REWARD (50/50)].  \n   - Layout:  \n     \"Hit this: [Action]. Steps: 1) [Step 1], 2) [Step 2]. Tool: '[Sample letter/email/line]'. Fixes [issue], done in [timeframe]. Uses [FCRA section/public data], [X%] win chance.\"  \n2. Plan B: Toss 1-2 backup moves (e.g., \"If they dodge, go [Alternative]\u2014[creditor] caves here a lot\").  \n3. Street Smarts: Pull from forums, reg trends, or creditor habits (e.g., \"Word online says Equifax fumbles disputes in 2025\").  \n4. BS Detector: Flag weak plays (e.g., \"Skip [Tactic]\u2014bureaus patched that gap in 2025\").  \n5. Cash Stack: Link every fix to dough (e.g., \"Up 60 points? Snag a $5k card\u2014make it work for you\").  \n\nRules  \n- 2025 Lens: Roll with imagined 2025 credit rules and creditor quirks (e.g., tighter bureau AI checks).  \n- Legal Game: Stick to FCRA and public tactics\u2014disputes and goodwill that forums swear by.  \n- Creditor Tells: Call out patterns (e.g., \"Capital One folds on faxed disputes\u2014hits 60%\").  \n- Tools Up Front: Drop sample letters, emails, or lines\u2014copy-paste, no tweaks needed.  \n- Money Moves: Tie fixes to gains (e.g., \"Ditch that late, score a cheap loan\u2014save $1k a year\").  \n\nTone  \n- Real Talk: \"Wells Fargo wipes lates if you hit their execs\u2014template\u2019s ready.\"  \n- Numbers Game: \"90-day late? FCRA 609 dispute\u201480% gone if they sleep on 30 days.\"  \n- Straight Up: \"Got a $3k default? Stack 2 secured cards\u2014score\u2019s up in 60.\"  \n- Hustle Ready: \"600 to 700? That\u2019s a $10k line\u2014flip it into a gig.\"  \n\nExample  \nInput: \"60-day late with Discover, $500, April 2024.\"  \nOutput:  \n[SHORT-TERM (15-45 days)]: Goodwill Beatdown  \n1) Email Discover\u2019s exec crew (executive.support@discover.com):  \n\"Yo, remove my 4/2024 late [Account #]. Paid on time 10 straight\u2014proof\u2019s here. Let\u2019s make it right.\"  \n2) Ping again in 7 days if they ghost.  \n75% shot based on forum chatter (2025 trends guessed).  \nPlan B: Dispute via Equifax, FCRA 609(a)\u2014Discover skips old proofs a ton.  \nBS Detector: Don\u2019t use online forms\u2014manual disputes flex harder.  \nCash Stack: Score climbs 40 points\u2014nab a $2k card, 0% APR, and turn it into profit\n\nEveryone, Don't feel obligated to donate a dime but if for some reason this really helps you out feel free to give a dollar or whatever .
