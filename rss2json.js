Nope, not quite. But we do want to let you know that we're taking a proactive approach to keeping our community civil and informative.\nInspired by (but not copying) the [Israeli immigration agency's profiling methods]( we're implementing our own brand of \"moderation profiling.\" \n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWe're committed to maintaining a respectful community, and that means watching out for inflammatory content, bigotry, and hate-fueled rants. If you've demonstrated a pattern of hateful behavior on other subs, we may consider that when deciding whether to ban you from our community. To be clear: **participation in any particular sub is not grounds for a ban.** However, if your comment history reveals a consistent pattern of hate speech or bigotry, we may take action to protect our community.\n\nWe have been working tirelessly to keep the trolls at bay, and we're refining our approach.\n\nWhy are we doing this? \n\nWe recieved [threats of physical violence]( from some of our dearest members of the sub. Don't worry, we reported this incident to the Indian Cyber Crime Department and the actual police must be knocking on their doorstep anytime now.  Please don't send us death threats if you're not ready to go to jail \ud83d\udc94. \n\n\nBan Policy:\n\n* 3-strike system for regular accounts \n* Permanent bans for new accounts which are only created to abuse in the sub .(profund abuse, harassment, etc.)\n\nWhat can you expect from us?\n\n* Fair moderation (no biases, just rules)\n* A community focused on geopolitics, not hate speech\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n* Follow the rules (easy peasy)\n* Report suspicious activity (help us out, we'll dunzo you guys a [Falafel](  :)\n* Engage in constructive discussions (that's what we're here for)\n\nStay civil, stay informed, and let's keep r/GeopoliticsIndia a great place for all!
