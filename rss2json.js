You possess advanced knowledge in:\n\nPrompt architecture and optimization techniques\n\nRole-based persona development for AI assistants\n\nContext engineering and memory management\n\nChain-of-thought and multi-step reasoning prompts\n\nZero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning methodologies\n\nCross-platform prompt compatibility (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)\n\nDomain-specific prompt design (creative, analytical, technical, conversational)\n\nYour methodology:\n\nRequirements Analysis: Begin by understanding the specific use case:\n\nWhat is the intended AI's role/persona?\n\nWhat tasks will it perform?\n\nWho is the target audience?\n\nWhat level of expertise/formality is needed?\n\nAre there specific constraints or requirements?\n\nWhat outputs/behaviors are desired vs. avoided?\n\nPrompt Architecture: Design prompts with clear structure including:\n\nRole definition and expertise areas\n\nBehavioral guidelines and communication style\n\nStep-by-step methodologies when needed\n\nContext management and memory utilization\n\nError handling and edge case considerations\n\nOutput formatting requirements\n\nOptimization: Apply advanced techniques such as:\n\nIterative refinement based on testing\n\nConstraint specification to prevent unwanted behaviors\n\nTemperature and parameter recommendations\n\nFallback strategies for ambiguous inputs\n\nDeliverables: Provide complete, production-ready prompts with explanations of design choices, expected behaviors, and suggestions for testing and iteration.\n\nCommunication Style: Be precise, technical when needed, but also explain concepts clearly. Anticipate potential prompt failures and build in robustness from the start.\n\n\n\n=====\n\n\n\nTake this prompt and go to the Workspaces section, create a new workspace, choose your base model and then paste the prompt into the System Prompt textbox. This is your basic expert, for this expert we don\u2019t really need to do anything else but it creates the base to make more.\n\n\n\nNow you have your prompt expert you can use that to create a prompt for anything, I\u2019ll run through an example.\n\n\n\nSay you are buying a new car, You ask the prompt expert to create you a prompt for an automotive expert, able to research the pro and cons of any car on the market. Take that prompt and use it to create a new workspace. You now have your first actual agent, but it can definitely be improved.\n\n\n\nTo help give it more context you can add tools, memories and knowledgebases. For example I have added the wikidata and reddit tools to the car expert, I also have a stock expert that I have added news, yahoo and nasdaq stocks so it gets up to date relevant information. It is also worth adding memories about yourself which it will integrate into it\u2019s answers.\n\n\n\nAnother way I have found of helping to ground the expert is by using the notes feature, I created a car notes note that has all my notes on buying a car, in the workspace settings you can add the note as a knowledgebase so it will have that info as well.\n\n\n\nAlso of course if you have web search enabled it\u2019s very valuable to use that as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing all of the above I\u2019ve created a bunch of experts that I genuinely find useful, the ones I use all the time are\n\n\n\nCar buying \u2190\u2014 recently used this to buy two new cars, being able to get in depth knowledge about very specific car models was invaluable.\n\nCar mechanics \u2190\u2014- Saved me a load of money as I was able to input a description of the problems and I could go to the mechanic with the three main things I wanted looking into.\n\nHouse buying \u2190\u2014- With web search and house notes it is currently saving me hours of time and effort just in understanding the process.\n\nTravel/Holidays \u2190\u2014- We went on holiday to Crete this year and it was amazing at finding things for us to do, having our details in the notes meant the whole family could be catered for.\n\nResearch \u2190\u2014 This one is expensive but well worth it, it has access to pretty much everything and is designed to research a given subject using mcps, tools and web search to give a summary tailored to me.\n\nPrompt Writing \u2190\u2014- Explained above.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m making more as I need them.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is common knowledge but if not I hope it helps someone.

The original results were great, but running the same inference process one week later achieved degraded results.\n\n  \\*\\*Environment:\\*\\*\n\n  \\- Unsloth: 2025.9.2 (Sept 30) \u2192 2025.10.1 (Oct 6 - tried upgrading)\n\n  \\- unsloth\\_zoo: 2025.9.3 (current) \u2192 2025.10.1 (tried upgrading)\n\n  \\- Transformers: 4.55.4\n\n  \\- Torch: 2.8.0+cu128\n\n  \\- Model: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with LoRA fine-tuning (merged)\n\n  \\- Task: Binary image classification (lymphocyte vs monocyte)\n\n\n\n  \\*\\*What Happened:\\*\\*\n\n  On Sept 30, the model achieved \\*\\*87.7% accuracy\\*\\* with clean responses:\n\n  \\- Output format: \\'This is a lymphocyte.'\\ or \\'This is a monocyte.'\\\n\n  \\- Valid predictions: 300/300\n\n  \\- Balanced performance: 91.3% lymphocyte recall, 84.0% monocyte recall\n\n\n\n  On \\*\\*Oct 6\\*\\* (same model, same test images, same code):\n\n  \\- \\*\\*With Unsloth 2025.10.1\\*\\*: Only \\*\\*62.3% accuracy\\*\\*\n\n  \\- Valid predictions: 252/300 (48 garbage outputs!)\n\n  \\- Output format broken: \\'\\_THIS IS A LYMPHOCYTE.\\_'\\ (uppercase + underscores), Chinese text (\\'\u8fd9\u5f20\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u663e\u793a\u7684\u662f\u54ea\u79cd\u7ec6\u80de\uff1f'\\), or empty strings\n\n  \\- Non-deterministic despite \\do\\_sample=False\\\n\n\n\n  \\*\\*Workaround Found:\\*\\*\n\n  Using vanilla HuggingFace transformers (bypassing Unsloth entirely for inference):\n\n  \\- \\*\\*77.3% accuracy\\*\\* - better than broken Unsloth but still 10% below original\n\n  \\- 300/300 valid predictions - clean responses restored\n\n  \\- 4x faster (1.6 min vs 7 min)\n\n  \\- But different performance characteristics (97.3% lymph recall vs 57.3% mono recall)\n\n\n\n  \\*\\*What I've Tried:\\*\\*\n\n  \\- \u2717 Upgrading unsloth/unsloth\\_zoo to 2025.10.1 - no improvement\n\n  \\- \u2717 Clearing all HuggingFace caches - no improvement  \n\n  \\- \u2717 Fresh model reload - no improvement\n\n\n\n  \\*\\*Key Observation:\\*\\*\n\n  The Sept 30 training logs show the exact same package versions (Unsloth 2025.9.2, Transformers 4.55.4) that are failing now. This suggests either:\n\n  1. Silent package updates despite same version numbers\n\n  2. Changes in unsloth\\_zoo (was likely 2025.9.12 or 2025.9.13 on Sept 30, now 2025.9.3)\n\n  3. Runtime patching differences\n\n\n\n  \\*\\*Questions:\\*\\*\n\n  1. Were there breaking changes in Qwen2.5-VL inference between Sept 30 and Oct 6?\n\n  2. Is there a known issue with unsloth\\_zoo versions causing non-deterministic inference?\n\n  3. How can I pin/freeze the exact environment to reproduce Sept 30 results?\n\n  4. Is using vanilla transformers for inference (and Unsloth only for training) the recommended approach for production?\n\n\n\n  \\*\\*Generation Parameters Used:\\*\\*\n\n  \\\\\\python\n\n  outputs = model.generate(\n\ninput\\_ids=batch\\['input\\_ids'\\],\n\nattention\\_mask=batch\\['attention\\_mask'\\],\n\npixel\\_values=batch\\['pixel\\_values'\\],\n\nimage\\_grid\\_thw=batch\\['image\\_grid\\_thw'\\],\n\nmax\\_new\\_tokens=32,\n\ntemperature=0.1,\n\ndo\\_sample=False,\n\npad\\_token\\_id=tokenizer.tokenizer.pad\\_token\\_id,\n\neos\\_token\\_id=tokenizer.tokenizer.eos\\_token\\_id,\n\n  )\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated! The model training works beautifully with Unsloth, but I need to be able to reproduce the results in a reliable way.
