Use \u2018Backstory Mode\u2019**\n\nGive the AI a backstory: \u201cYou\u2019re a solopreneur who just hit \\\\$10K/mo using AI tools. Share your journey in 10 tweets.\u201d \u2192 Converts better than generic tone.\n\n**7. AI as Business Validator**\n\nPrompt: \u201cTest this product idea against a skeptical investor. List pros, cons, and how to pivot it.\u201d \u2192 Useful for lean startups &amp; validation.\n\n**8. Local Language Tweaks**\n\nPrompt in English, then: \u201cNow rewrite this copy for Gen Z readers in India/Spain/Nigeria/etc.\u201d\n\nMultilingual = multi-market.\n\n**9. Reverse Engineering Prompt**\n\nAsk the AI to **reveal the prompt** it thinks generated a result. Example: \u201cGiven this blog post, what was the likely prompt? Recreate it.\u201d \u2192 Learn better prompts from finished work.\n\n**10.
