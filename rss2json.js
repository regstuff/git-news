Has any of that been revisited? Can you recommend any books or articles on the subject?\n\nI ask that because so much of science or anything academic from the 1800s to early 1900s seems to be heavily steeped in a Victorian outlook of gender roles and sexual relationships. For example when it comes to songbirds in North America, our Victorian-lensed ornithologists presented rosy 100% monogamous relationships, when later research has shown that for many birds there's a lot of \"extracurricular activities\" (socially monogamous, but not genetically monogamous). And there's a colony of albatrosses where something like 1/3 of the nesting pairs are both females, who would get pregnant with a male and go back to nesting with a female, this discovered through DNA testing. We are culturally trained to assume one male, one female in a pair of birds and lacking the visual acuity to distinguish male from female, that's what we go with until somebody uses a better tool.\n\nBack to archaeology: I'm assuming we get the accumulated opinion that \"well we know women were almost never warriors throughout history\" *precisely* because any time a grave was dug up and weapons found, the archaeologist never went any further and declared the skeletal remains belonged to a man, not bothering to closely examine the pelvis or skull.\n\nI am just somebody who reads archaeology discoveries casually but with interest, and this is something that's been tickling my curiosity. And digging into esoteric rabbit holes, I've been noticing how often our received knowledge is influenced by Victorian attitudes.\n\nBirds and monogamy:\n\n\n\nLaysan albatrosses:\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1g4yv80/misidentification_of_female_remains_as_male/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel is a rogue nation.
