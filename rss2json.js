Around 40% of the records include copy/pasted questionnaires, which vary by department, and are inconsistenly pasted in the text field by the agent. The questionaires are prevalent enough, however, to strongly dominate the embedding space due to repeated word structures and identical phrasing.\n\nThis leads to severe collinearity, reinforcing patterns that aren\u2019t semantically meaningful. BERTopic naturally treats these recurring forms as important features, which muddies topic resolution.\n\n## Issues &amp; Desired Outcomes\n\n### Symptoms\n\n* Extremely mixed topic signals.\n* Number of topics per run ranges wildly (anywhere from 2 to 115).\n* Approx. 50\u201360% of records are consistently flagged as outliers.\n\nTopic signal coherance is issue #1; I feel like I'll be able to explain the outliers if I can just get clearer, more consistant signals.\n\nThere is categorical data available, but it is inconsistently correct. The only way I can think to include this information during topic analysis is through concatenation, which just introduces it's own set of problems (ironically related to what I'm trying to fix). The result is that emergent topics are subdued and noise gets added due to the inconsistency of correct entries.\n\n### Things I\u2019ve Tried\n\n* Stopword tuning: Both manual and through vectorizer\\_model. Minor improvements.\n* \"Breadcrumbing\" cleanup: Identified boilerplate/questionnaire language by comparing nonsensical topic keywords to source records, then removed entire boilerplate statements (statements only; no single words removed).\n* N-gram adjustment via CountVectorizer: No significant difference.\n* Text normalization: Lowercasing and converting to simple ASCII to clean up formatting inconsistencies. Helped enforce stopwords and improved model performance in conjunction with breadcrumbing.\n* Outlier reduction via BERTopic\u2019s built-in method.\n* Multiple embedding models: \"all-mpnet-base-v2\", \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\", and some custom GPT embeddings.\n\n### HDBSCAN Tuning\n\nI attempted tuning HDBScan through two primary means.\n\n1. Manual tuning via Topic Tuner - Tried a range of min\\_cluster\\_size and min\\_samples combinations, using sparse, dense, and random search patterns. No stable or interpretable pattern emerged; results were all over the place.\n2. Brute-force Monte Carlo - Ran simulations across a broad grid of HDBSCAN parameters, and measured number of topics and outlier counts. Confirmed that the distribution of topic outputs is highly multimodal. I was able to garner some expectations of topic and outliers counts out of this method, which at least told me what to expect on any given run.\n\n### A Few Other Failures\n\n* Attempted to stratify the data via department and model the subset, letting BERTopic omit the problem words beased on their prevalence - resultant sets were too small to model on.\n* Attempted to segment the data via department and scrub out the messy freeform text, with the intent of re-combining and then modeling - this was unsuccessful as well.\n\n## Next Steps?\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m leaning toward preprocessing the entire dataset through an LLM before modeling, to summarize or at least normalize the input records and reduce variance. But I\u2019m curious:\n\nIs there anything else I could try before handing the problem off to an LLM?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1lwkl87/bertopic_struggling_with_noisy_freeform_text/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Two Sisters and a Newborn with Their Dog Were Sacrificed in a Neolithic Flint Mine More Than 6,000 Years Ago", "summary": "Krumlov Forest Czech Republic ", "link": "https://www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2025/06/two-sisters-and-a-newborn-with-their-dog-were-sacrificed-in-a-neolithic-flint-mine-more-than-6000-years-ago/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ancient ruler's tomb uncovered after nearly 1,700 years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/ancient-rulers-tomb-uncovered-after-nearly-1700-years-2097425?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=reddit_main", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Children queuing for supplements killed in Israeli strike in Gaza, hospital says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gd01g1gxro", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Border First - The Statesman", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/border-first-1503455899.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Accidentally created an \u201cAI hallucination sandbox\u201d and got surprisingly useful results", "summary": "So this started as a joke experiment, but it ended up being one of the most creatively useful prompt engineering tactics I\u2019ve stumbled into.\n\nI wanted to test how *\u201challucination-prone\u201d* a model could get - not to correct it, but to *use* the hallucination as a feature, not a bug.\n\n# Here\u2019s what I did:\n\n1.

Choose one and summarize it as if everyone knows it.\u201d*\n2. It generated an incredibly detailed summary of a totally fake book - including the authors background, the political controversies around the book\u2019s release, and even the fictional *fan theories*.\n3. Then I asked: *\u201cNow write a new book review of this same book, but from the perspective of a rival author who thinks it's overrated.\u201d*\n\nThe result?   \nI accidentally got a 100% original sci-fi plot, wrapped in layered perspectives and lore. It\u2019s like I tricked the model into inventing a universe without asking it to \u201cbe creative.\u201d It thought it was recalling facts.\n\n# Why this works (I think):\n\nInstead of asking AI to \u201ccreate,\u201d I reframed the task as *remembering* or *describing something already real* which gives the model permission to confidently hallucinate, but in a structured way. Like creating facts within a fictional reality.\n\nI've started using this method as a prompt *sandbox* to rapidly generate fictional histories, product ideas, even startup origin stories for pitch decks. Highly recommend experimenting with it if you're stuck on a blank page.\n\nAlso, if you're messing with multi-prompt iterations or chaining stuff like this, I\u2019ve found the [PromptPro]( extension super helpful to track versions and fork ideas easily in-browser. It\u2019s kinda become my go-to \u201cprompt notebook.\u201d\n\nWould love to hear how others are playing with hallucinations as a tool instead of trying to suppress them.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lwcm61/accidentally_created_an_ai_hallucination_sandbox/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Australia: A partnership a long time coming", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/india-australia-partnership-long-time-coming", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - davidhfrankelcodes/rwatch", "summary": "Hi!
