The thing I am confused about is that in a multi-class classification task such as NER, shouldn't micro F1, recall and precision all be the same? How come shared tasks such as i2b2 states that their primary metric is \"Micro-averaged Precision, Recall, F-measure for all concepts together\" when they are all the same. The studies doing that task also gives three different values for the micro-avg metrics. \n\n[\n\nAny explanation is appreciated!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1j2chov/evaluation_metrics_for_information_extraction/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rare Video of Polar Bear Cub Tenderly Cuddling Mom Captured by Lucky Tour Guide", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aol.com/rare-video-polar-bear-cub-151500101.html?", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dal diplomacy: import duty plans to spare the US, punish Canada", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-trade-concessions-us-lentils-bta-import-duty-canada-australia-11740912263793.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia-linked Telegram channels \u2018offering to pay for attacks on UK mosques\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/feb/28/russia-linked-telegram-channels-offering-to-pay-for-attacks-on-mosques", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bristol volunteers plant record number of trees in woodland", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03d18erp0o", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
