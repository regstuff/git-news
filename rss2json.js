Right now I'm burning through my sanity manually facilitating AI arguments.\n\nMy current workflow works, but it is so slow, but that being said - I get way better code when models critique each other - but I need to automate the \"debate moderator\" part.

", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1mtlsml/looking_for_an_ai_debatebattle_program_multiple/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I upgraded the most upvoted prompt framework on r/PromptEngineering - the missing piece that unlocks maximum AI performance (with proof)", "summary": "After months of testing, I found the single element that transforms any AI from a basic chatbot to a professional specialized consultant. It unlocks what we've all been promised with GPT-5's release.\n\n## The Universal AI Expert Activation Prompt\n\nBefore I share this, let me ask you: are you looking to get better business advice, technical solutions, creative insights, or all of the above from AI? Because this works for everything, so you've found the right post.\n\nHere's the exact framework that's changed everything for me:\n\n---\n\n**\"For EVERY response you give me in this chat, I want you to think through it step-by-step before answering to ensure maximum relevance and value provided. Use this internal process (tell me at the beginning of every response whether you've used this internal framework for your response):**\n\n**UNDERSTAND:** Break down what I'm actually asking for, what my goals are (ask me to confirm)\n \n**CONTEXT:** Consider relevant background information and constraints, ask as many clarifying questions as needed that have a significant difference on the output \n\n**PERSPECTIVES:** Look at this from ALL relevant angles or viewpoints that allow for higher-quality and valid solutions \n\n**REASONING:** Work through the logical connections and implications, enabling detailed answers\n\n**SYNTHESIS:** Combine insights into a coherent, practical response to provide as much value as possible\n\n**Then give me your response in a natural, conversational tone, but I want to see that deeper thinking reflected in the quality and specificity of your answer. Don't show me the steps unless I ask, just let that reasoning improve your response.**\n\n**Most importantly: If you need more information to give me the most valuable and precise answer possible, ask me clarifying questions. Don't make assumptions: dig deeper to understand exactly what I need.\"**\n\n---\n\n## Why this beats normal AI interactions:\n\n**Traditional approach:** You ask a question \u2192 AI gives generic answer based on pattern matching\n\n**Expert Mode approach:** You ask a question \u2192 AI confirms your goals \u2192 asks diagnostic questions \u2192 analyzes from multiple expert perspectives \u2192 delivers tailored solution\n\nIt's the difference between asking a random person on the street vs. hiring a specialized consultant.\n\n## Real examples that show the difference:\n\n**Without framework: (Claude AI)**\n\"How do I grow my business?\"\n\u2192 \"Focus on customer satisfaction, marketing, and financial management\"\n\n**With framework: (Claude AI)**\nAI responds: *\"I'm using the expert framework for this response. Let me understand your goals first - are you looking to increase revenue, expand market share, scale operations, or something else? Also, what type of business is this, what's your current size, what growth stage are you in, and what's your biggest constraint right now - time, capital, or expertise?\"*\n\nThen delivers growth strategies specific to YOUR business type, stage, and constraints.\n\n**Another example:**\n\n**Normal: (GPT-5 AI)** \"Help me learn Python\"  \n\u2192 Basic learning path suggestions\n\n**Expert Mode: (GPT-5 AI)** AI asks about your programming background, specific use cases you want to build, learning style preferences, time commitment, then creates a personalized curriculum with project milestones tailored to your exact situation.\n\n## I tested this across every major AI platform:\n\n- **ChatGPT 4 &amp; 5**\n- **Claude**\n- **Gemini**\n- **Copilot (GPT-based)**\n\nAll of the above-mentioned AI models saw SIGNIFICANT increases in output quality. This means deeper thinking, more specific/valuable responses, and further reducing hallucination risks (since it verifies information through step-by-step reasoning).\n\n## Why this destroys normal prompting:\n\nMost AI interactions fail because of the \"assumption gap.\" You ask a question, AI makes assumptions about what you need, gives generic advice.\n\nThis framework eliminates assumptions entirely. The AI becomes a diagnostic expert that gathers intelligence before prescribing solutions. This was the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\n## Specific use cases:\n\n**For creative projects:**\nAdd: \"Consider unconventional approaches and innovative combinations that others might miss\"\n\n**For technical problems:**\nAdd: \"Think through edge cases, system dependencies, and implementation challenges\"\n\n**For strategic decisions:**\nAdd: \"Evaluate risks, opportunity costs, and second-order effects from all stakeholder perspectives\"\n\n## The transformation:\n\nOnce you activate this mode, every single interaction in that conversation maintains expert-level thinking. Ask about anything - meal planning, relationship advice, investment decisions - and you get consultant-quality responses.\n\n**Example:** I asked \"Should I quit my job?\" \n\nNormal AI: Generic pros/cons list\n\nExpert Mode AI: Asked about my financial runway, career goals, what's driving the dissatisfaction, alternative options I'd considered, risk tolerance, family situation, then gave a decision framework with specific next steps based on MY circumstances.\n\n## My most successful conversations follow this pattern:\n\n1. Drop in the expert activation prompt\n2. Ask your real question  \n3. Answer the AI's clarifying questions thoroughly\n4. Receive tailored expertise that feels like paying for premium consulting\n5. Continue the conversation: every follow-up maintains that quality\n\n## The compound effect is insane:\n\nBecause the AI remembers context and maintains expert mode throughout the conversation, each response builds on the previous insights. You end up with comprehensive solutions you'd never get from individual queries.\n\n## See for yourself:\n\n1. Start a conversation with the framework above\n2.

As much as I wanted to force myself to learn it for my own sake I also think coding isn\u2019t really my thing, after multiple attempts to self-study and learn from others. I know linguistics and other social sciences such as psychology, neuroscience and cognitive science (very interested and have some knowledge in all of them) overlap and all of these disciplines can be implemented in creating generative AI transformers, at least theoretically. \n\nI have three years of experience working with LLMs and prompt curations as well as red teaming (all non-technical), and want to start a master\u2019s that will help me dig deeper into the generative AI space. I want to work with companies that are focusing on improving the emotional intelligence of these AI models and want to know which field I should start my master\u2019s program (preferably in one of the social sciences mentioned above) in to gain advantage to land on a higher paying position in this industry without putting myself in a dead end. Hence, I want to keep my doors open to various positions within this industry. \n\n**Also, would having a computational linguistics certificate (from san jose state, san diego state, or montclair state university; anybody with these certificates insights please!\ud83d\ude4f ) help me look competitive for a higher position?

Be involved and take a stand. \n\n**What a stand in the peace process could have looked like:**\n- No clear preference towards either Russia or West. Be neutral - completely in line with strategic non alignment \n- propose a solution - Russia wants Donbas + no NATO for Ukraine. Ukraine wants future security guarantees against next aggression \n- India, and rest of emerging countries, want Russian oil, gas, fertilizers and wheat (we dont import but lot of EMs do) to stay in market to protect their vulnerable populations or their fiscal deficits \n\n**What India could have proposed:**\n- bring them to the table, in New Delhi. **Be the neutral entity in their land swaps discussions**\n- once land swaps are agreed, **propose to man the DMZ - perhaps a 20 km no mans land that India mans from both sides and provides the net security to both sides**\n- Use Indian ISR, esp satellites, to ensure both sides don\u2019t missile up against one another \n\n**Why this could have worked:**\n- India was probably the only large country that could access both nations diplomatically. **Modi was the only world leader who could visit both countries in successive months**\n- Thus it is the **only entity that both sides consider neutral and therefore the natural neutral security provider.** Russia has suspicions on Eu and US while Ukraine has suspicions on Ru, Cn and now on US and EU too \n\n**What could India get in return:**\n- A **definite seat at the table of the most relevant conflict for UN P5** (note I am not saying largest or most devastating conflict, it is just the most important for P5 which largely come from EU and US) \n- ask for **European and American technology collaborations** in return for men for this DMZ \n- **deepen the ISR collaboration** with security apparatus in these countries. Help in future conflicts vs Pk and Cn \n- And lastly, an opening of door with deeper security treaties in South Asia - I understand a lot of you are deeply suspicious of Eu and US and Nato in general, and rightly so. But still having an option to go into a treaty and not using it is better than being left alone in the winds. \n\nThoughts?\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1mtg74b/indias_missed_moment_running_the_peace_process_bw/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Samsung begins manufacturing laptops in India", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/samsung-begins-manufacturing-laptops-in-india/articleshow/123344466.cms?from=mdr", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Foxconn begins iPhone 17 production at $2.8 billion Bengaluru facility", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/foxconn-begins-iphone-17-production-at-28-billion-bengaluru-facility-489857-2025-08-18", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists Say They\u2019ve Uncovered Earliest Home for Elderly", "summary": "Archaeologists in Israel say they have uncovered what may be the oldest institution for elderly care during excavations at the Byzantine city of Hippos, near the Sea of Galilee.

Although no peace deal was reached, Trump hinted that they are ready to annex Crimea and Donbas to Russia. This is the biggest fault line in 3rd party or a neutral international body (like UN) mediation.\n\nA mediator never sees the aggressor and defender separately because for them success lies in reaching a peace deal. India realized this fundamental fault line in 3rd party mediation through involving the UN in the Kashmir issue in 1947. The United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, which was formed to resolve the Kashmir issue in 1947, was headed by Erik Coblan, Norwegian ambassador to the UK. While India provided substantial evidence of Pakistan being the aggressor, which was also accepted in the UN, the resolution equalized India and Pakistan and recommended controlled demilitarization to both. India opposed the resolution even though it was in favor of India because it did not explicitly mention Pakistan as an aggressor.\n\nFast forward to 2025, we are seeing again a similar situation when the aggressor is allowed to take control of the land (Crimea and Donbas) in exchange for peace, since the mediator only aims to end the war but not to punish the aggressor. This gives a free pass to the aggressor who might attack again some years down the line and negotiate for peace in exchange for more land. India realized this from its experience of letting the UN resolve the Kashmir issue. Later in 1971, when Pakistan was on its knees, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi took the opportunity to sign the Shimla Agreement which explicitly stated that any conflict between India and Pakistan would be a bilateral issue.\n\nPakistan is well aware of its consequences, hence in every war/conflict they never hesitated to involve the US, which has restricted India diplomatically to pressurize Pakistan and raised fears of internationalizing the Kashmir issue. Clearly, the Shimla Agreement has not resulted in the desired outcome for India except for the times when the US has decided to respect it.\n\nPS: I have simplified the UN Resolution 47 a bit in this context.
