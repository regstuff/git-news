That would require a three-fifths majority of MPs, and it remains unclear if that will be possible.\n\nIn September, parliament\u00a0[approved](\u00a0a bill that would have banned the chaining of dogs at home and also introduced minimum sizes of kennels that dogs can be kept in.\n\nThe measure was supported by Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right, but also some MPs from the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, including its leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski.\n\nHowever, after the bill reached Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition, he\u00a0[decided](\u00a0to exercise his right to veto. Nawrocki argued that, \u201calthough the intention \u2013 protecting animals \u2013 is just and noble, the law itself was poorly drafted\u201d.\n\nIn particular, the president said that elements of the legislation introducing minimum sizes for dog kennels \u2013 of at least 20m\u00b2 for the largest dogs \u2013 were unrealistic and would \u201charm farmers, breeders and ordinary rural households\u201d.\n\nNawrocki proposed his own bill that includes a ban on chaining dogs at home. However, W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament,\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that he would instead seek to overturn the president\u2019s veto on the original bill.\n\nThat would be an extremely rare occurrence: the last time a presidential veto was overturned by parliament was in 2009. But Czarzasty appeared to have a chance of success given that the dog-chaining ban received the support of over three-fifths of MPs when it was approved by parliament in September.\n\nHowever, it appears likely that most, if not all, of the PiS MPs who voted in favour of the bill initially will not support overturning the veto of Nawrocki, who was elected this year with PiS\u2019s backing and has generally supported the party\u2019s agenda since taking office. That would likely mean the veto will not be overturned.\n\nIn a United Surveys poll published on Sunday by the Wirtualna Polska news website, 61% of respondents said they opposed Nawrocki\u2019s veto while 36% supported it. Participants in Sunday\u2019s march appealed to MPs to vote to overturn it, rather than accept the president\u2019s proposed alternative.\n\n\u201cWe stand here today because we refuse to accept suffering, which is still legal in Poland, because a dog on a chain, a dog confined in a cramped area, is a suffering dog,\u201d said Robert Ma\u015blak, an expert in animal welfare from the University of Wroc\u0142aw.\n\nMa\u015blak said that banning chaining alone would not be enough because studies show that dogs kept in confined spaces suffer stress, which leads to behavioural disorders. That in turn can make animals aggressive and more of a threat to humans.\n\n\u201cReplacing the chain with a cramped kennel does not solve the problem,\u201d he warned, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/15/thousands-march-in-protest-against-polish-presidents-veto-of-dog-chaining-ban/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
