People in other fields always talk about getting multiple offers at once, but this has never happened to me. \n\nFor example, I have been waiting on one job which I really wanted and both interviews went really well. I thought I had it. I already had an opportunity (but it's a contract and no benefits), so I told them I have to wait until I hear about the first one. But because the good opportunity was taking so long, I reached out for any updates- finding out later that I wasn't chosen. Now I have to take the worse of the two.
