It then generates intelligent alias suggestions using schemes like:\n\n* **Vowel Removal**: git status \u2192 gst\n* **Abbreviation**: ls -la \u2192 ll\n* **First Letter Combination**: docker compose \u2192 dcompose\n* **Smart Truncation**: git checkout \u2192 gco\n* **Prefix Matching**: git commands \u2192 g + subcommand letter\n\nSome of its features are:\n\n* Interactive aliases for browsing adding and removing aliases.\n* Ability to\u00a0**track your aliases across multiple shells and multiple alias files**.\n* Command-line mode for quick alias operations.\n* Cross-platform: Works on Linux, macOS, BSD, and Windows (via WSL).\n\nAlman offers an installation script that works on any platform for easy setup and is also available through cargo, yay, etc.\n\nTry it out and streamline your workflow.
