How much savings would I need or basically what will be average expenses, because I don't want to take a student loan again \ud83d\ude05. I have a Stamp 4 (green card equivalent I guess) in Ireland , but I am a non-EU citizen.\n\n2. What's the exam format? On the website it says written, but has it changed after covid or is it still the same. And if yes, then how difficult is it to write an examination in 3 hours, for all the courses. I am not sure if I can sit and write exams, so would need a better insight into it before I commit myself to this course.\n\n3. I want to pursue a PhD after this course. But I would still like to know if I have good job options open for me as well.\n\n4. If not KU Leuven , what were some other college options you had in mind? I would love if you could share some. I am considering few other colleges as well, but currently, this course is my top priority.\n\n5. Do I need to learn a new language? I know English , German. I have French certification from college but I forgot almost all.\n\n6. What are my chances of getting selected? I have a masters from Trinity, my masters thesis was on a similar topic , I graduated with distinction. I have 6 years of experience in the industry.\n\n7. Any scholarship or sponsorship options ?\n\n8. Since I have a whole year to prepare for this course, should I start some online courses that might help me face the intensive course structure.\n\nAny help is much appreciated.
