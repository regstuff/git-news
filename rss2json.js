How would I correctly evaluate how it performs?", "summary": "So I am implementing a feature that automatically extracts information from a document using Pre-Trained LLMs (specifically the recent Llama 3.2 3b models). The two main things I want to extract are the title of the document and a list of names involved mentioned in it. Basically, this is for a document management system, so having those two pieces of information automatically extracted makes organization easier.\n\nThe system in theory should be very simple, it is basically just: Document Text + Prompt -&gt; LLM -&gt; Extracted data. The extracted data would either be the title or an empty string if it could not identify a title. The same goes for the list of names, a JSON array of names or an empty array if it doesn't identify any names.\n\nSince what I am trying to extract is the title and a list of names involved I am planning to just process the first 3-5 pages (most of the documents are just 1-3 pages, so it really does not matter), which means I think it should fit within a small context window. I have tested this manually through the chat interface of Open WebUI and it seems to work quite well.\n\nNow what I am struggling with is how this feature can be evaluated and if it is considered Named Entity Recognition, if not what would it be considered/categorized as (So I could do further research). What I'm planning to use is a confusion matrix and the related metrics like Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F-Measure (F1).\n\n~~I'm really sorry I was going to explain my confusion further but I am struggling to write a coherent explanation \ud83d\ude05~~\n\nOkay so my confusion is about accuracy. It seems like all the resources I've read about evaluating NER or Information Retrieval say that Accuracy isn't useful because of class imbalance where the negative class is probably going to make up a big majority and thus the accuracy would be very high due to the amount of true negatives skewing the accuracy in a way that isn't useful. At least this is how I am understanding it so far.\n\nNow in my case, True Positive would be extracting the real title, True Negative would be extracting no title because there isn't any title, False Positive would extracting a title incorrectly, and False Negatives would be falsely extracting no title even though there is a title.\n\nBut in my case I think there isn't a class imbalance? Like getting a a True Positive is just as important as getting a False Negative and thus accuracy would be a valid metric? But I think that sort of highlights a difference between this Information Extraction vs Named Entity Recognition/Information Retrieval, which makes me unsure if this fits those categories. Does that make sense?\n\nSo in this information extraction I'm doing, finding and extracting a title (True Positive) or not finding a title thus returning an empty string (True Negative) are both important output and thus I think having the accuracy metric is a valid way to evaluate the feature.\n\nI think in a way extraction is a step you do after recognition. While doing NER you go through every word in a document and label them as an entity or not, so the output of that is a list of those words with a label for each. Now with extraction, you're taking that list and filtering it by ones labeled by a specific class and then returning those words/entities.\n\nWhat this means is that the positive and negative classes are different. From what I understand in NER, the positive class would be an entity that is recognized while the negative class would be one that is not a recognized entity. But in extraction, the positive class is if it was found and extracted and the negative class is fit it was not found and thus nothing was extracted. \n\nHonestly I don't know if this makes any sense, I've been trying to wrap my head around this since noon and it is midnight now lol", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1h1up89/extracting_informationmetadata_from_documents/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Alaskan Woman Drops Thanksgiving Turkeys from Plane in an Effort to Feed Neighbors Who Live \u2018Off the Grid\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://people.com/alaskan-woman-drops-thanksgiving-turkeys-from-plane-in-an-effort-to-feed-neighbors-8752884", "author": "None"}, {"title": "C Raja Mohan writes: Dealing with the China question", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-writes-dealing-with-the-china-question-9694080/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A guide to build you own SQL query planner/optimizer", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/tuannh982/query-planner-guide", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\ude80 youGotMail - Rust-Based Email Spammer (using gmail)", "summary": "", "link": "http://github.com/NewDawn0/youGotMail", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel says ceasefire with Hezbollah violated, fires on south Lebanon", "summary": "Did not last long \ud83d\ude1e", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-tank-fires-3-south-lebanese-towns-lebanese-security-sources-media-say-2024-11-28/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A British guy crashed her Thanksgiving dinner.

I dont think there is a quick and easy answer but i thought i may as well ask the experts. I had to deduplicate a dataset containing merchant names. I've cleaned the data to a good extent and achieved a reasonably standardized format for the merchant names (though it's still not perfect). For example:\n\n|Adidas International Trading Ag Rapresentante|Adidas Ag Rapresentante|\n|:-|:-|\n|Adidas International Trading Ag C 0 Rappresentante|Adidas Ag Rapresentante|\n|Adidas Argentina S A Cuit 30685140221|Adidas Argentina Cuit|\n|Adidas Argentina Sa Cuyo|Adidas Argentina Cuit|\n|Adidas International Trading Bv Warehouse Adc|Adidas Bv Warehouse|\n|Adidas International Trading Bv Warehouse Adcse|Adidas Bv Warehouse|\n\nI want to build a model that, given an uncleaned name, outputs the cleaned version. However, the problem I\u2019m facing with using RNNs and CNNs is that when the model encounters an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) term, the predictions are extremely poor, I want the model to learn the cleaning and cluster patterns, rather than learning embedding representation in the training data. My dataset is large, with around half a million observations.\n\nI considered building a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, but it would be difficult to annotate representative data due to the significant geographical variation in the merchant names. FastText isn't ideal for entity recognition in this case, so I'm currently using Sentence-BERT.\n\nI'm looking for a robust model that can generalise well to other similar datasets, using transfer learning.
