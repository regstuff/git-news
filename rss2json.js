Trump even hosted Pakistan\u2019s army chief at the White House.\n* **Big claims on mediation:** Trump floated stopping war between India and Pakistan , which directly clashes with India\u2019s long-standing bilateralism policy (no third-party mediation).\n\n**So what\u2019s going on here?**\n\nPossible motives behind U.S. actions\n\n1. Market access pressure Agriculture is a sore spot especially dairy, poultry, meat, grains. Washington has long complained India blocks U.S. farm exports. Tariffs + H-1B restrictions could be aimed at forcing Delhi to open its ag market.\n2. Russia/BRICS angle The White House tied tariffs to India\u2019s Russian oil imports. With India active in BRICS+ and buying Russian crude, this could be punishment for hedging away from the West.\n3. Domestic politics The H-1B fee plays well with \u201cprotect U.S. jobs\u201d rhetoric. Tariffs and tough talk on trade are also core Trump campaign promises.\n4. Regional balancing The Saudi\u2013Pak pact and F-16 sustainment deal strengthen Islamabad. That may be about Gulf stability, but it also increases pressure on India\u2019s neighborhood.\n\n**Where Trump\u2019s team leans on India?**\n\n* USTR (Greer): Hardline reciprocity, tariffs as leverage.\n* State (Rubio): Wants India as a China counterweight, but hasn\u2019t stopped punitive measures.\n* Defense (Hegseth): Promotes \u201cMajor Defense Partnership\u201d with India, while simultaneously funding Pakistan\u2019s F-16 upkeep.\n* Commerce (Lutnick): Very blunt \u201cmake a deal\u201d or face tariffs.\n\n**What leverage does India have?**\n\nIndia is not without cards of its own:\n\n* Market size: U.S. firms (tech, defense, pharma, energy) want access to India\u2019s 1.4B-strong consumer base. Delhi can slow-roll approvals, licenses, and contracts to push back.\n* Defense purchases: India is a top buyer of U.S. defense gear (P-8I aircraft, drones, artillery). Delhi can diversify more toward France, Israel, or Russia if Washington squeezes too hard.\n* Strategic positioning: India is central to U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. With China tensions high, Washington cannot afford to push India too far toward Moscow or Beijing.\n* Energy deals: India buys large amounts of U.S. LNG and coal. This demand gives it negotiating room, especially if the U.S. wants stable buyers amid shifting global energy flows.\n* Tech/workforce ties: Indian IT services and H-1B talent underpin much of Silicon Valley\u2019s labor market. Too harsh a clampdown hurts U.S. companies as much as Indian outsourcers.\n* Global South influence: India has positioned itself as a leader of the Global South. If Washington alienates Delhi, it risks weakening its standing in multilateral forums where India has rising influence.\n\n**The big question for India watchers**\n\nIs this really about forcing India to buy U.S. ag products and open its market, or is agriculture just one card in a bigger game , Russia alignment, BRICS politics, and regional balancing with Pakistan/Saudi?\n\nAnd if it is about ag, how far would Trump go more tariffs, squeezing visas further, or dangling defense tech? On the flip side, how far would India lean on its market size, defense purchases, and strategic weight to push back?\n\nBottom line: India is being pressured on multiple fronts, but it also has leverage. The U.S. can escalate, but too much pressure risks India tilting further toward strategic autonomy or even closer to Moscow/Beijing. Whether this ends in a grand bargain (ag + trade for defense/tech + visa relief) or a drawn-out standoff will depend on how both sides play their cards.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1nmgeoh/is_trump_using_h1b_fees_tariffs_and_pakistan/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Native MCP (streamable HTTP) may be on the way", "summary": "In case anyone missed [this comment]( Tim recently clarified that streamable HTTP MCP support will be added soon.\n\nThe current dev branch already has some drastic changes related to external tools (seemingly allowing external tool servers to generate visual cards and outputs like Claude Artifacts) - making me think it could be added soon (maybe with the next version)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1nm9mjy/native_mcp_streamable_http_may_be_on_the_way/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "From Temples to Mosques: A Journey Through India\u2019s Hidden Old City", "summary": "", "link": "https://youtu.be/n-_p4R9nXIc?si=-FqXKOit_s-yRryn", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Symbolmatch: experimental minimalistic symbolic parser combinator", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/tearflake/symbolmatch", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ffclipper - Lightweight ffmpeg frontend for convenient video clipping", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Jonny-GM/ffclipper/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Milei\u2019s fall from grace: Argentina\u2019s stock market becomes the world\u2019s worst performer in 2025", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-09-20/mileis-fall-from-grace-argentinas-stock-market-becomes-the-worlds-worst-performer-in-2025.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada has formally recognized a Palestinian state, aligning itself with European allies", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/canada-s-carney-formally-recognizes-palestine-in-historic-shift", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada formally recognizes Palestine as a country", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/canada-s-carney-formally-recognizes-palestine-in-historic-shift", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Search of chat hangs, logs list \"unsupported Unicode escape sequence\"", "summary": "So I have OWUI set up in a container to use PostgreSQL from another container.

"summary": "##Core budget to fall to $3.2bn next year and initial minimum 3,000 job cuts expected amid streamlining process\n\nThe UN will need to cut $500m (about \u00a3370m) from next year\u2019s budget and lose 20% of its staff as it struggles to cope with a massive reduction in funding by the Trump administration.\n\nThe plan, in gestation since Donald Trump started cutting his foreign aid budget, is likely to involve an initial minimum 3,000 job cuts out of a 35,000-strong main workforce. The overall UN core or regular budget would be cut from $3.7bn to about $3.2bn next year. It means reductions of 15.1% in resources and 18.8% in posts in the regular budget compared with the 2025 budget.\n\nThe reductions to the UN core budget do not take account of the cuts to the UN\u2019s peacekeeping, humanitarian and health agencies. Only last year the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, set the UN on an ambitious new \u201c[pact for the future]( ranging across artificial intelligence and a new push on sustainable development.\n\nGuterres is trying to make a virtue of necessity by using the funding crisis to review how the bureaucracy has grown, leading to overlapping mandates and duplication. It requires an organisation containing more than 140 entities that has passed 40,000 resolutions, statements and presidential statements since its inception in 1946 to revert to first principles about its purpose and effectiveness.\n\nThrough a programme known as Mandates UN, all of the UN agencies have been asked to justify their existence, the origin of their mandate and their relationship to other UN entities.\n\nThe aim broadly is to try to streamline these agencies into three key pillars of the UN charter: peace and security, human rights and development. In the process, some agencies and staff will be blended with others and some will be shrunk.\n\nAllison Lombardo, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs at the US state department, said [at a Carnegie Endowment seminar]( \u201cThese cuts are more extensive and more permanent than many people thought at first glance \u2026 The US pays 22% of the regular budget, 25% of the peacekeeping budget and 40% of the humanitarian budget.\u201d\n\nThe impact on individual programmes is already apparent. The World Food Programme (WFP) relied on Washington to cover half of its $9bn budget in 2024, while the UNHCR got two-fifths of its funding from the US. The US has not only [ended its funding]( for the UN\u2019s Palestinian welfare agency Unrwa, it has tried to close it down.\n\nAt a stark briefing this week, Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN Office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (Ocha), said he feared the world had entered a new \u201cage of indifference\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only been funded 19% of what we need, which is a 40% drop on where we were last year,\u201d he said, explaining that each of the UN agencies had a tale of woe. \u201cUnicef \u2013 an extra 6 million kids are likely to be out of school. WFP are saying they can only reach 1 million of the 3 million Afghans who currently need food. UNHCR are saying that 11 million refugees may no longer get the help that they need.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/united-nations-un-2026-budget-job-losses-us-funding-cuts", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - evoluteur/isomorphic-table-cards: Table and Cards views with animated transitions on sorting, switching view, and browser resizing (no dependencies, just vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML).", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/evoluteur/isomorphic-table-cards", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A bright pink tractor, driven by Jody Marton, has led a parade of 73 farm vehicles around North Yorkshire to raise money for breast cancer awareness.
