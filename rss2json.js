These questions are currently stored in an Excel file and the dataset is in Italian. I'm looking for the best tools and methodologies available as of May 2024 to accomplish this.\n\nMy key requirements are:\n\n* The chatbot should not produce hallucinated answers.\n* It must strictly stick to the topic when answering questions.\n\nI've previously worked with intent detection linked to function calling, and have familiarity with RAG (both sparse and dense). While I find these methods effective, I'm interested in possibly utilizing something straightforward like the OpenAI Assistant API, but I'm open to other suggestions as well.\n\nWhat would you recommend as the most effective approach to achieve these goals? Are there specific frameworks or technologies that are particularly suited for handling this kind of task, especially given the language and accuracy requirements?\n\nThanks for your insights", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cltgkt/best_method_to_create_a_python_chatbot_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia threatens Britain with retaliation if involvement in Ukraine war deepens", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russia-threatens-britain-with-retaliation-if-involvement-in-ukraine-war-deepens", "author": "None"}, {"title": "FTC Announces Rule Banning Noncompetes", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Olympic weightlifter from Ukraine dies fighting in war with Russia", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic weightlifter from Ukraine dies fighting in war with Russia</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvc3BvcnQvb2x5bXBpYy13ZWlnaHRsaWZ0ZXItdWtyYWluZS1kaWVzLXJ1c3NpYS1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9zcG9ydC9vbHltcGljLXdlaWdodGxpZnRlci11a3JhaW5lLWRpZXMtcnVzc2lhLXNwdC1pbnRs?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-05-07", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Denver Nuggets star Jamal Murray throws heat pack on court, labeled \u2018inexcusable\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Denver Nuggets star Jamal Murray throws heat pack on court, labeled \u2018inexcusable\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvc3BvcnQvamFtYWwtbXVycmF5LWRlbnZlci1udWdnZXRzLWhlYXQtcGFjay1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9zcG9ydC9qYW1hbC1tdXJyYXktZGVudmVyLW51Z2dldHMtaGVhdC1wYWNrLXNwdC1pbnRs?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-05-07", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs wins NBA Rookie of the Year award", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs wins NBA Rookie of the Year award</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvc3BvcnQvdmljdG9yLXdlbWJhbnlhbWEtbmJhLXJvb2tpZS1vZi15ZWFyLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVZodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L3Nwb3J0L3ZpY3Rvci13ZW1iYW55YW1hLW5iYS1yb29raWUtb2YteWVhci1zcHQtaW50bA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-05-07", "author": "None"}]}}};
