I'm going to be getting my masters degree in Archaeology this spring (working on the thesis now), and have been working part time at a school here. It's been tough work, but today I got some very strong hints that the school intends to ask me to be a full time teacher (maybe a work visa?) later on. I was already planning on moving back to the US to pursue archaeology (probably starting at the bottom as a field tech), and this alternative has left me feeling unbalanced. Long term I know moving back to the US for financial and career reasons is the correct path. I'll also be able to access my family, and begin building my retirement (a necessity as a US citizen). Downside, I'll be starting over entirely, with minimal money and practically no relevant archaeological experience, also as a 30 year old. Versus I take the (possible) offer I think I'll be receiving here in Italy, continue being a teacher (not my life goal), without the long term benefits of citizenship.\n\nWritten out, I see that I should continue my goal, but I'm still struggling with the emotions from realizing I'll have to make the decision soon, whether that's in a month or 4 months.
