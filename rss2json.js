Called\u00a0\u201cC-00000291*.sys,\u201d it was buried in an update for CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon sensor product. The bad file caused an error in Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows operating system, rendering computers inoperable and triggering the dreaded \u201cblue screen of death.\u201d\n\n&gt; After Microsoft, CrowdStrike is the second-biggest maker of \u201cmodern endpoint protection\u201d software and controls 18% of the $12.6 billion market, according to research firm IDC. The Austin-based company\u00a0sells its products to 29,000 organizations around the world, so the outage likely affected millions of computers that could take weeks or longer to bring back online because they must be repaired manually.\u00a0\n\n&gt; Kurtz didn\u2019t specify\u00a0how the flaw got into the\u00a0update. But some longstanding critics of his industry already have a working theory. They say CrowdStrike and other cybersecurity companies have sacrificed basic, boring security principles while chasing bigger profits and trying to appease shareholders.\u00a0\n\n&gt; Cyber industry observers wonder if CrowdStrike will learn from its own mistake. Already some are saying the company had been asking for trouble. For years, CrowdStrike has attacked Microsoft for allowing hackers to penetrate its systems, and Kurtz has used those\u00a0lapses\u00a0as a selling point for his own products.\n\n&gt; Michael Henry, co-founder and chairman of Plano, Texas-based cybersecurity services firm Accelerynt Inc., says one customer, a large US retailer, had to call in its entire IT staff and had them working round the clock updating some 6,000 affected computers by hand. The company expected it to take all weekend to restore critical systems, he said, and as much as three weeks before all systems are fully back online.\n\n**\u201dCrowdStrike has done more to disrupt global business than all the ransomware operators combined\u201d**\n\n&gt; The problem is that these\u00a0technologies are largely controlled by Microsoft and CrowdStrike. Some experts, including Justin Cappos, a computer science professor at New York University, said he\u2019s been warning that that consolidation in the security industry\u2014\u00a0and centralized decision-making that comes with it \u2014 can lead to big problems, a debate that\u2019s happened elsewhere in tech. \n", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-07-19/crowdstrike-outage-reveals-global-it-fragility-leaving-airports-banks-paralyzed", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Adidas apologizes for ad campaign linked to 1972 Munich Olympics", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Adidas apologizes for ad campaign linked to 1972 Munich Olympics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMTkvc3BvcnQvYWRpZGFzLWFwb2xvZ2l6ZXMtYWQtY2FtcGFpZ24tYmVsbGEtaGFkaWQtc3B0LWludGwtc2NsaS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-19", "author": "None"}]}}};
