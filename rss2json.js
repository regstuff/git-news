Adding edge cases can boost performance, but you\u2019ll need to watch for overfitting!\n* **Start simple**: Nothing beats concise, clear, verb-driven prompts. Reduce ambiguity \u2192 get better outputs\n\n* **Be specific about the output**: Explicitly state the desired structure, length, and style (e.g., \u201cReturn a three-sentence summary in bullet points\u201d).\n\n* **Use positive instructions over constraints**: \u201cDo this\u201d &gt;\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Reserve hard constraints for safety or strict formats. \n\n* **Use variables**: Parameterize dynamic values (names, dates, thresholds) with placeholders for reusable prompts.\n\n* **Experiment with input formats &amp; writing styles**: Try tables, bullet lists, or JSON schemas\u2014different formats can focus the model\u2019s attention.\n\n* **Continually test**: Re-run your prompts whenever you switch models or new versions drop; As we saw with GPT-4.1, new models may handle prompts differently!\n\n* **Experiment with output formats**: Beyond plain text, ask for JSON, CSV, or markdown. Structured outputs are easier to consume programmatically and reduce post-processing overhead .\n\n* **Collaborate with your team**: Working with your team makes the prompt engineering process easier. \n\n* **Chain-of-Thought best practices**: When using CoT, keep your \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u2026\u201d prompts simple, and don't use it when prompting reasoning models\n* **Document prompt iterations**: Track versions, configurations, and performance metrics.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kggmh0/google_dropped_a_68page_prompt_engineering_guide/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New AI model outperforms OpenAI, Deepgram, and ElevenLabs on Japanese ASR benchmarks", "summary": "This blog breaks down how a new model handled Japanese ASR tasks better than OpenAI's Whisper, Deepgram, and ElevenLabs.
