Bless those who persecute you, but pray also for those who seek to destroy you and who harm you.\u201d\n\nThe pilgrimage, and football fan groups more broadly, have often been criticised by parts of the media and centrist and left-wing politicians for their associations with nationalism and violence.\n\nOn Sunday, Tomasz Trela, an MP from The Left (Lewica), which is part of Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, criticised Nawrocki for attending a pilgrimage of \u201cstadium thugs\u201d.\n\nWirtualna Polska, a leading news website, reports that, while at Jasna G\u00f3ra yesterday, Nawrocki was pictured embracing the leader of a hooligan gang who has convictions for serious violent crimes and whose home was found to contain photos of \u201cracist and Nazi behaviour\u201d when searched by police.\n\nAt previous pilgrimages, fans have\u00a0[sung chants](\u00a0about \u201changing communists from trees\u201d, which critics have argued is inappropriate at a Catholic shrine. Some participants have displayed white supremacist symbols, such as the Celtic cross.\n\nIn 2020, the religious authorities at Jasna G\u00f3ra monastery for the first time\u00a0[issued rules prohibiting political speeches]( as well as the promotion of racism, xenophobia and nationalism. However, right-wing political figures have continued to speak there during pilgrimages and other events.\n\nLast year, Nawrocki\u2019s main rival for the presidency, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, criticised his opponent for his appearance at the fans\u2019 pilgrimage, saying that it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that he was campaigning at a Catholic shrine.\n\nDuring his campaign, Nawrocki also\u00a0[faced media claims](\u00a0that he had in the past been associated with criminal elements linked to football fan groups, and even involved himself in procuring prostitutes.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk claimed that Nawrocki had \u201cconnections with gangsters\u201d and had been involved in \u201carranging girls\u201d for guests at a luxury hotel where he worked in security.\n\nHowever, Nawrocki denied the accusations and has never faced any charges for criminal activity.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/11/president-calls-for-poland-without-illegal-immigrants-at-football-fan-pilgrimage-to-catholic-shrine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish public administration excludes software from vendors other than Microsoft in public tenders", "summary": "", "link": "https://cyberdefence24.pl/polityka-i-prawo/polska-administracja-jest-uzalezniona-od-oprogramowania-microsoftu-publiczne-przetargi-pod-lupa", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I Was Kidnapped by Idiots", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/kidnapped-baghdad/685470/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Myanmar made Rohingya lives a nightmare, Gambia tells genocide case", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/landmark-myanmar-rohingya-genocide-case-open-uns-top-court-2026-01-12/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Slovak journalist attacked, government ministers fault his public statements", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/slovak-journalist-attack-draws-crocodile-tears-government-ministers-peter-schutz/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Starlink in the crosshairs: How Russia could attack Elon Musk's conquering of space", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/russia-starlink-musk-ukraine-space-china-canada-c69c1fda5ffc93828712ab723e606a2c", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Duhok Governor Reaffirms Shared Destiny as Foundation Stone Laid for Assyrian Genocide Memorial", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/885179/duhok-governor-reaffirms-shared-destiny-as-foundation-stone-laid-for-assyrian-genocide-memorial", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hungary grants asylum to Polish former justice minister Ziobro", "summary": "Hungary has granted asylum to former Polish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who is facing charges in Poland for\u00a026 alleged crimes committed while he served in the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government.\n\n\u201cI have decided to accept the asylum granted to me by the government of Hungary due to the political persecution in Poland,\u201d wrote Ziobro in a statement on social media. \u201cI extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to \\[Hungarian\\] Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\u201d\n\nZiobro claimed that Poland\u2019s current government, which replaced PiS in power in December 2023, is overseeing a \u201ccreeping dictatorship\u201d and that he had \u201cbecome the target of \\[Prime Minister\\] Donald Tusk\u2019s personal vendetta\u201d.\n\nHe also revealed that he had applied for asylum for his wife, saying that there is \u201can attempt to treat \\[her\\] as a hostage to force me to return to the country\u201d and \u201cI will not allow my wife, in my stead, to become the victim of Donald Tusk\u2019s psychopathic revenge\u201d.\n\nLast week, it emerged that Hungary had granted asylum to two unnamed Polish citizens on 23 December. That led to speculation that one of them was Ziobro, who left Poland for Hungary in October, shortly before Poland\u2019s justice minister\u00a0[asked parliament](\u00a0to lift his immunity from prosecution.\n\nZiobro\u2019s former deputy justice minister, Marcin Romanowski, was likewise\u00a0[granted asylum by Hungary in 2024](\u00a0after fleeing criminal charges in Poland. He remains in Budapest.\n\nOn Friday, the Polish foreign ministry summoned the Hungarian ambassador to clarify the situation, but spokesman Maciej Wewi\u00f3r said afterwards that they had still \u201cnot received an answer from the Hungarian side as to who was granted asylum\u201d.\n\nOn Monday morning, Ziobro\u2019s lawyer, Bartosz Lewandowski, confirmed that his client \u201chas obtained international protection and political asylum in Hungary in connection with violations of rights and freedoms on Polish territory guaranteed by international law\u201d.\n\n\u201cPolitical asylum was granted in connection with actions by the prosecutor\u2019s office and services subordinate to the government, which resulted in a series of actions bearing the hallmarks of politically motivated political repression,\u201d he added.\n\nIn November, parliament\u00a0[approved](\u00a0the lifting of Ziobro\u2019s immunity, opening the way for prosecutors to bring charges for 26 alleged crimes relating to his time as justice minister.\n\nThey include establishing and leading a criminal group and abusing his powers for personal and political gain. If found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nZiobro \u2013 who was one of the most prominent figures in the PiS government and led its contested overhaul of the judiciary \u2013\u00a0denies wrongdoing but\u00a0[says](\u00a0he will only return to Poland to face trial \u201cwhen the rule of law is restored\u201d.\n\nShortly after arriving in Budapest, Ziobro met with Orb\u00e1n, who posted a picture of the pair together and condemned the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against the Polish right launched by \u201cthe pro-Brusselian Polish government\u201d.

Orb\u00e1n is facing elections in April, with opinion polls indicating he may lose power.\n\nTusk\u2019s government has made it one of its priorities to hold to account former PiS officials for alleged crimes. Prosecutors have brought charges against a number of prominent figures,\u00a0[including](\u00a0former PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\n\nHowever, PiS has argued that the Tusk administration is simply pursuing a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d against its opponents, and that it is using unlawful methods to do so.\n\nIn May last year, a group of five Republican members of the US House Committee on the Judiciary\u00a0[wrote to the European Commission](\u00a0expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the rule of law in Poland, in particular that the government is \u201cweaponising the justice system\u201d against the conservative opposition.\n\nIn December, a Warsaw court\u00a0[cancelled](\u00a0the European Arrest Warrant issued against Romanowski, with the judge saying that the the Polish government had \u201cviolated human rights and civil liberties\u201d, including the presumption of innocence.
