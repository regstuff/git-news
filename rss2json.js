That is the exact opposite of how therapists communicate, as anyone who\u2019s ever been to therapy will tell you. So obviously I instruct ChatGPT to be brief and to speak plainly. But is that enough? And how does one evaluate how a \u2018real\u2019 therapist speaks?\n\nAlthough I personally have a wealth of experience with therapists of different styles, including CBT, psychoanalytic, and psychodynamic, and can distill my experiences into a set of shared or common principles, it\u2019s not really enough. I wanted to compare the output of my bespoke GPT to a professional\u2019s actual transcripts. After all, despite coming from the engineering culture which generally speaking shies away from institutional gatekeeping, I felt it prudent that due to this field\u2019s proximity to health to perhaps rely on the so-called experts. So I hit the internet, in search of open-source transcripts I could learn from.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find, but they exist, in varying forms, and in varying modalities of therapy. Some are useful, some are not, it\u2019s an arduous, thankless journey for the most part. The data is cleaned, parsed, and then compared with my own outputs.\n\nAnd the process continues with a copious amount of trial and error. Adjusting the prompt, adding words, removing words, \u2018massaging\u2019 the prompt until it really starts to sound \u2018real\u2019. Experimenting with different conversations, different styles, different ways a client might speak. It\u2019s one of those peculiar intersections of art and science.\n\nOf course, a massive question arises: do these transcripts even matter? This form of therapy fundamentally differs from any \u2018real\u2019 therapy, especially transcripts of therapy that were conducted in person, and orally. People communicate, and expect the therapist to communicate, in a very particular way. That could change quite a bit when clients are communicating not only via text, on a computer or phone, but to an AI therapist. Modes of expression may vary, and expectations for the therapist may vary. The idea that we ought to perfectly imitate existing client-therapist transcripts is probably imprecise at best. I think this needs to be explored further, as it touches on a much deeper and more fundamental issue of how we will \u2018consume\u2019 therapy in the future, as AI begins to touch every aspect of our lives.\n\nBut leaving that aside, ultimately the journey is about constant analysis, attempts to improve the response, and judging based on the feedback of real users, who are, after all, the only people truly relevant in this whole conversation. It\u2019s early, we have both positive and negative feedback. We have users expressing their gratitude to us, and we have users who have engaged in a single conversation and not returned, presumably left unsatisfied with the service.\n\nIf you\u2019re excited about this field and where AI can take us, would like to contribute to testing the power and abilities of this AI therapist, please feel free to check us out at\u00a0[ Anyone who is serious about this and would like to help improve the AI\u2019s abilities is invited to request a free upgrade to our unlimited subscription, or to the premium version, which uses a more advanced LLM.
