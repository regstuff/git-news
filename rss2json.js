It\u2019s built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, and works with both English and Chinese.\n\nMy use case:\n\nI tested it on several documents:\n\n1. A two-column academic paper with complex tables spanning both columns and multiple pages.\n\n2. A scanned form with handwritten entries and math equations.\n\n3. A multilingual report (English-Chinese) containing tables and figure references.\n\nWhat worked well:\n\n\\- Cross-page table merging was accurate. It managed to join table segments split across pages, and automatically remove duplicate table headers while merging the corresponding contents intact.\n\n\\- It handled merged cells and irregular table structures better than most tools I\u2019ve used, outputting clean HTML.\n\n\\- It preserved the placement of figures and labels, which is often dropped by simpler OCR systems.\n\n\\- It also retains the original font sizes across all heading levels, which makes the structure much clearer, and it smartly removes irrelevant stuff like footnotes or page numbers.\n\nCompared to olmOCR:\n\nI ran the same documents through olmOCR (also open-source), and found a few differences:\n\n\\- olmOCR struggled with merged cells and occasionally dropped columns entirely in complex tables.\n\n\\- It had no support for cross-page structures, which led to broken context.\n\nOCRflux gave significantly better results in terms of structure preservation and format coherence, although olmOCR was a bit lighter and faster in runtime.\n\nSome caveats:\n\n\\- OCRflux\u2019s output is Markdown + HTML, which is useful for downstream processing but may require cleanup for publishing. It\u2019s not the fastest option; processing heavier PDFs takes noticeable time.\n\n\\- LaTeX recognition works, but if you're parsing dense math docs, you\u2019ll probably still want to post-edit.\n\nI know as a new release, it's not perfect, but the direction is encouraging.

These are serious prompts designed to create actual business assets; things like productized services, high-converting sales scripts, scalable workflows, and even mindset breakthroughs.\n\nThe real benefit comes from combining a clear role, a smart framework, and a strong objective. Every prompt here is built on a battle-tested mental model from business, psychology, or systems design and I\u2019ve included the framework for each one so you can understand why it works and become better at prompting yourself .\n\nThese are the 10 best prompts I\u2019ve used, all copy-paste ready. Save them, use them, and let me know what results you got.\n\n**1. The \"Signature Service\" Design Framework: Chain of Thought + Productization**\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**CoT (Chain of Thought) + Productization.**\u00a0Chain of Thought prompts the AI to \"think step-by-step,\" breaking a complex problem into a logical sequence. Productization is the business concept of turning a service into a standardized, scalable product.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0This prompt stops you from selling your time (e.g., \"blog post writing\") and starts you selling a high-value, productized system (e.g., \"The SEO Authority Engine\"). This is the single fastest way to 5x your freelance income.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a high-ticket business consultant. My current service is [Generic Service, e.g., 'writing social media posts']. I want to transform this into a premium \"Signature Service\" that I can charge [Target Price, e.g., '$3,000/mo'] for.\n    \n    Think step-by-step to design this service:\n    1.  Give it a compelling, branded name: (e.g., \"The Viral Content Engine\").\n    2.  Define the specific, transformational outcome for the client:** What is their \"dream result\"?\n    3.  Break it down into 3-5 unique pillars or phases: (e.g., Pillar 1: Audience &amp; Competitor Analysis, Pillar 2: High-Impact Content Creation, Pillar 3: Multi-Platform Distribution &amp; Engagement).\n    4.  List the specific, tangible deliverables for each pillar.\n    5.  Suggest a unique process or proprietary method** that makes my service different from what anyone else offers.\n\n**2. The Niche Authority Affiliate Review Article Framework: CO-STAR**\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**CO-STAR (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response).**\u00a0This framework provides the AI with a comprehensive creative brief, ensuring all aspects of the output are perfectly aligned with the strategic goal.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0This creates a perfectly structured, SEO-optimized \"money post\" that's designed to build trust and convert readers. It forces the AI to focus on user benefits, not just product features, which is the key to high conversion rates.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a world-class SEO copywriter and expert in the [Your Niche, e.g., 'home coffee brewing'] niche.\n     \n    Context: You are writing for a blog that helps beginners make informed buying decisions.\n    \n    Objective: To persuade the reader to purchase the [Product Name, e.g., 'Breville Barista Express'] through an affiliate link by providing immense value.\n    \n    Style: Expert, yet approachable and engaging.\n    \n    Tone: Honest and trustworthy, not overly \"salesy.\"\n    \n    Audience: Beginners in the niche who are considering a significant purchase.\n    \n    Response Structure:\n    1.  Catchy, SEO-Optimized Title: Include \"Review,\" \"Is It Worth It,\" and the current year.\n    2.  Introduction: Hook the reader by addressing their core problem/desire and state the final verdict upfront.\n    3.  Core Features Deep Dive: Explain the 5 most important features and, crucially, the benefit of each feature for the user.\n    4.  Pros and Cons Table: A scannable, honest breakdown.\n    5.  \"Who is this product FOR?\" (And who it's NOT for).\n    6.  Comparison: Briefly compare it to one major competitor.\n    7.  Conclusion &amp; Final Recommendation: A strong call-to-action (CTA).\n\n**3. The \"Value Ladder\" Architect Framework: Strategic Business Modeling**\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**Strategic Business Modeling.**\u00a0Based on a classic marketing concept popularized by Russell Brunson, this prompt guides the AI to map a customer's entire journey, from low-cost entry to high-ticket purchase.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0A single product is not a business. This prompt helps you design a complete product ecosystem that maximizes customer lifetime value and builds a sustainable, scalable business.\n\nPrompt:\n\n    Act as a business model strategist. \n    \n    My expertise is in [Your Skill, e.g., 'Notion productivity']. \n    Design a \"Value Ladder\" for my business. \n    \n    Map out a 4-step ladder that guides a customer on their journey with me: \n    - Lead Magnet (Free) \n    - Tripwire Offer ($7\u2013$47) \n    - Core Offer ($197\u2013$497) \n    - High-Ticket Offer ($1,500+)\n\n**4. The AI-Powered Productized Service Blueprint Framework: SOP Design + Systems Thinking**\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Design + Systems Thinking.**\u00a0This prompt tasks the AI with creating a detailed, step-by-step workflow, treating a business process like an assembly line where AI tools are the automated machinery.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0This designs a scalable service where AI does 80% of the work. This allows you to offer a high-value service at a competitive price while maintaining massive profit margins. It's the blueprint for a modern, AI-leveraged business.\n\nPrompt:\n\n    I want to sell a productized service called \"[Service Name, e.g., 'Podcast Repurposer Pro']\" for [Price, e.g., '$299/episode']. The service turns one podcast episode into multiple content assets.\n    \n    Design the complete AI-assisted workflow for this service:\n    1.  Client Input: What does the client provide? (e.g., an mp3 file).\n    2.  The AI Workflow (Step-by-Step):\n           Step 1: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Whisper AI'] for transcription.\n           Step 2: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Claude 3'] with a specific prompt to extract 5 key takeaways and a summary.\n           Step 3: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'ChatGPT-4'] with a prompt to write 3 Twitter threads based on the takeaways.\n           Step 4: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Canva AI'] to create 5 quote cards.\n    3.  Human Review: Where is the crucial human touchpoint for quality control and strategic polish before delivery?\n\n**5. The \"Blue Ocean\" Strategy Canvas Framework: Blue Ocean Strategy**\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**Blue Ocean Strategy (from W. Chan Kim &amp; Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne).**\u00a0This is a world-renowned business strategy framework for creating new market space (\"Blue Oceans\") and making competition irrelevant.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0Instead of trying to outperform rivals in a bloody \"red ocean,\" this prompt uses a famous framework to help you invent a new market. It's for creating a business that has no direct competition.\n\n**Prompt**\n\n    Act as a business strategist trained in Blue Ocean Strategy. I am in the crowded [Your Industry, e.g., 'project management software'] industry.\n    \n    Help me find a new market space using the \"Four Actions Framework\":\n    1.  List Key Factors: What are the 6-8 factors that companies in my industry currently compete on?\n    2.  Eliminate: Which of these factors that the industry takes for granted can we completely eliminate?\n    3.  Reduce: Which can be reduced well below the industry standard?\n    4.  Raise: Which can be raised well above the industry standard?\n    5.  Create: What new factors can we introduce that the industry has never offered?\n    \n    Based on your answers, propose a new, innovative product concept for a currently underserved customer.\n\n**6. The VSL (Video Sales Letter) Script Generator**\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**Direct-Response Copywriting Structure.**\u00a0This prompt follows a classic, psychologically-driven sales script formula proven to hold attention and drive conversions in video format.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0VSLs are one of the highest-converting sales assets online. This prompt provides a proven script structure that takes a viewer from casual interest to a strong desire to buy. It's a money-printing machine if done right.\n\n**The Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a direct-response video scriptwriter. Write a complete 10-minute VSL script to sell my [Product/Course, e.g., 'Side Hustle Launchpad' course]. The video will be voiceover on top of simple text slides.  \n    \n    Follow this structure precisely: \n    1.  The Hook (0-30s): A bold, pattern-interrupting question or statement. \n    2.  Problem &amp; Agitation (30s-2m): Detail the audience's pain. \n    3.  Introduce the \"New Opportunity\" (2m-3m): Hint at the solution without revealing the product. \n    4.  Backstory &amp; Discovery (3m-5m): Your story of finding this solution. \n    5.  The Solution Reveal (5m-7m): Introduce your product by name. \n    6.  The Offer Stack (7m-9m): List every deliverable, bonus, and guarantee to build overwhelming value. \n    7.  The Urgent CTA (9m-10m): A clear call to action with scarcity or urgency.\n\n# 7. The \"Voice of Customer\" Data Miner\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**APE (Action, Purpose, Expectation).**\u00a0This direct prompting framework is ideal for specific data analysis tasks. We are telling the AI exactly what to do, why it's doing it, and what the final output should look like.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0The best marketing copy uses the customer's exact words. This prompt turns the AI into a research analyst that can sift through reviews or comments to pull out the exact pain points and \"golden phrases\" you should be using in your ads and sales pages.\n\n**The Prompt:**\n\n    Action: Analyze the following set of [source, e.g., 'Amazon reviews for a competing product']. \n    Purpose: To extract the \"Voice of Customer.\" I want their exact pain points, desires, and language to use in my marketing. \n    Expectation: \n    1.  List the top 5 recurring Pain Points mentioned. \n    2.  List the top 5 Desired Outcomes they talk about. \n    3.  Extract 10-15 \"golden phrases\" \u2013 direct, emotionally charged quotes. \n    4.  Summarize the overall customer sentiment in one paragraph.  \n    \n    [Paste your raw data here.]\n\n# 8. The \"Economic Moat\" Audit\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**Value Investing Principles (from Warren Buffett/Charlie Munger).**\u00a0This prompt applies the mental models of the world's best investors to your own business, forcing a focus on long-term defensibility.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0A profitable business is good; a\u00a0defensible\u00a0business is valuable. This prompt forces you to analyze how protected your business is from competition. A strong moat is what allows for long-term, sustainable profits.\n\n**The Prompt:**\n\n    Role: A value investor and business analyst. \n    \n    Task: Audit my business, [Business Description], to assess the strength of its economic moat.  Analyze my business against the four primary types of economic moats. Provide a score of 1-5 for each and a suggestion for how to widen that moat. \n    1.  Intangible Assets: (Brand, IP) \n    2.  Switching Costs: (How hard is it for customers to leave?) \n    3.  Network Effects: (Does the service get better with more users?) \n    4.  Cost Advantages: (Can I operate cheaper than rivals?)  \n    \n    Provide an overall summary of my business's long-term defensibility.\n\n# 9. The High-Converting Freelance Service Page Copy\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0CoT (Chain of Thought) + Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) Copywriting.\u00a0The prompt's step-by-step nature guides the AI through a logical flow, mirroring the classic PAS formula to create persuasive, client-centric copy.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0Most freelancers list their skills. This prompt forces the AI to write a page that focuses entirely on the client's pain and desired outcome, which is infinitely more persuasive. It's designed to generate leads, not just inform.\n\n**The Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a direct-response copywriter. Write the copy for the service page of a [Your Service, e.g., 'Webflow Developer']. \n    \n    The audience is non-technical small business owners who are overwhelmed and need a website that gets them clients.  \n    \n    Think step-by-step: \n    1.  Start with a headline that speaks directly to their pain point (e.g., \"Your Website Should Make You Money, Not Headaches.\"). \n    2.  Write an opening paragraph that shows empathy for their struggle. \n    3.  Create a \"Here's How We Fix It\" section with 3 simple, benefit-focused steps. \n    4.  Write a section titled \"This Is For You If...\" to qualify the right clients. \n    5.  Include a clear Call to Action (e.g., \"Book a Free 15-Minute Strategy Call\").  \n    \n    Tone: Confident, clear, and benefit-oriented. Avoid technical jargon.\n\n# 10. The Core Belief Autopsy\n\n**Framework Used:**\u00a0**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - The \"Downward Arrow\" Technique.**\u00a0A therapeutic technique designed to trace a surface-level emotional reaction down to the foundational, often unconscious belief that's driving it.\n\n**Why it's powerful:**\u00a0The biggest bottleneck in any solo business is the founder's own psychology. This prompt helps you uncover the deep, limiting beliefs (e.g., \"I'm a fraud\") that lead to procrastination and fear of selling. Solving this is more valuable than any marketing tactic.\n\n**The Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a cognitive archaeologist. \n    I want to investigate a recent negative emotional reaction related to my business.  \n    \n    The Situation: [e.g., \"I needed to send a proposal to a big potential client, and I felt completely frozen with anxiety.\"]  \n    \n    The Investigation (The \"Downward Arrow\"): \n    1. What was the specific emotion? \n    2. What was the \"hot thought\" in that moment? (e.g., \"They're going to think my prices are too high.\") \n    3. If that thought were true, what would it mean about me? (\"It means I'm not worth it.\") \n    4. And if that were true... what does it mean? (\"It means I'm a fraud.\")  \n    \n    Keep going until you hit a foundational belief about yourself. Stare it in the face. This is what you're really fighting.\n\nI hope you find this useful.\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lk2vys/10_prompts_for_solopreneurs_with_frameworks_that/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Any tools exist for creating your own LIWC with customized categories?", "summary": "I have 138 custom categories I'd like to map to a customized LIWC.
