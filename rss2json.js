He has published an article essentially arguing that geopolitical interventions by Western nations have created refugee crises, yet those same nations implement policies to keep out the displaced populations their actions helped create. Think about it US ruined Afghanistan but refugees are borne by India.  His central argument is that mainstream refugee law scholarship ignores connections between imperialism and displacement.\n\nHe points out that many recent major refugee flows occurred because of Western interventions in the Global South, specifically mentioning Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Yet refugees fleeing these nations are not welcome in the Global North countries whose policies contributed to instability in their home regions.\n\nThe article traces how the 1951 Refugee Convention functioned differently depending on geopolitical circumstances. During the Cold War, Western nations used it liberally to accept refugees from communist countries because this served their strategic interests. People fleeing Eastern Europe or Cuba were welcomed as proof that the opposing system was failing.\n\nAfter the Cold War ended, the primary direction of refugee movement shifted from South to North. At that point the same convention that had been interpreted generously became the basis for what scholars term the \"non entree regime,\" essentially a system of barriers to keep people out. This entire transformation happened without any formal amendment to the treaty text.\n\nChimni argues that understanding these patterns requires examining what he calls the \"logic of capital\" alongside the \"logic of territory.\" The logic of territory refers to state sovereignty and the right to control borders. The logic of capital refers to how global capitalism shapes state behavior and migration patterns.\n\nHe contends that imperialism, which he defines as economic and political practices facilitating global capital accumulation at the expense of postcolonial nations, underlies both underdevelopment and internal conflicts in Global South countries. These in turn produce forced and voluntary migration. Yet this causal chain gets ignored in mainstream analysis.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the article highlights how concepts of responsibility in international law could theoretically be applied to refugee situations but aren't. International law has doctrines of state responsibility, but these aren't invoked to argue that states whose interventions caused displacement should bear responsibility for admitting refugees.\n\nHe notes that the 1951 Convention and broader international refugee law were framed during the colonial period, and that colonialism's legacy shapes current arrangements. For instance, European colonial powers moved between 12 and 37 million people as indentured labor from 1834 to 1941. From 1850 to 1920, 40 million Europeans migrated overseas to settler colonies. Yet when a tiny fraction of that scale of movement occurs in reverse today, it's framed as a crisis.\n\nThe article points out that only 0.8% of the developing world's workforce has migrated to industrialized countries since World War II. If the Global South had emigrated at the same rate Europeans did historically, 800 million people would have moved north. Instead the actual number is one twentieth that proportion, and asylum seekers and refugees are only a fraction of even that small percentage.\n\nChimni argues for what he calls a 'dialectical approach' that would examine both formal legal obligations and these structural and historical factors. This would include developing norms of responsibility sharing that account for which nations' policies caused displacement, rather than current arrangements where refugee hosting falls disproportionately on neighboring countries in the Global South.\n\nHe proposes expanding the refugee definition to include climate displaced persons, which has particular relevance for South Asia given vulnerability to climate impacts. He also calls for giving refugees voice in asylum policy formation through what he terms the 'all affected principle' arguing that those subjected to political rule should have a say in such rule even without citizenship.\n\nThe article suggests that private corporations profiting from border control, which he terms the \"border industrial complex,\" represent how capital shapes contemporary migration governance. For example, Australia spent 1.4 Billion$ on a private company over 5 years without hosting a single refugee in those 5 years. He calls for applying human rights obligations to these private actors.\n\nWhether one agrees with the analysis or not, it centers questions about which nations bear responsibility for displacement and for those arguing why India hasn't signed the Refugee Convention, not only we have hosted a large no of refugees for mess created by Global North, ask them why have they changed their own standards.\n\nSource - [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1o9pqk0/indian_scholar_argues_refugee_flows_from/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "91% of Aussies support trans\u2019 rights", "summary": "", "link": "https://lens.monash.edu/@politics-society/2025/10/17/1387926/the-power-of-allies-in-safeguarding-the-rights-of-trans-people-in-australia", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel kills 11 Palestinian family members in Gaza\u2019s deadliest truce breach", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/israel-kills-11-palestinian-family-members-in-gazas-deadliest-truce-breach", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Introducing ScreenDiffusion \u2014 Real-Time img2img Tool Is Now Free And Open Source", "summary": "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI\u2019ve just released something I\u2019ve been working on for a while \u2014 ScreenDiffusion, a free open source realtime screen-to-image generator built around Stream Diffusion.\n\nThink of it like this: whatever you place inside the floating capture window \u2014 a 3D scene, artwork, video, or game \u2014 can be instantly transformed as you watch.

I'm worried about latency, cost, and the LLM sometimes being unreliable. Are there better, more efficient patterns for this?\n2. **No Conversation Memory:**\u00a0Each user turn is independent.\n   * *Example:*\u00a0User: \"Find me Alice's contact.\" -&gt; Bot finds it. User: \"Now invite her to the project.\" -&gt; The bot doesn't know \"her\" is Alice and fails or the bot need to select Alice again and then invite her, which is a redundant turn.\n   * **How do I add simple context/memory to bridge these turns?**\n3. **Scaling Prompt Management:**\u00a0We have to manually update our giant LLM prompt every time we add a new function. This is tedious and tightly coupled.\n   * **How can we manage this dynamically?**\u00a0Is there a standard way to keep the list of \"available actions\" separate from the prompt logic?\n\n**Tech Stack:**\u00a0Go, Python, using an LLM API (like OpenAI or a local model).\n\nI'm looking for best practices, common design patterns, or any tools/frameworks that could help.
