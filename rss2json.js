Which I think is very bad since it makes it very difficult to f ind out why it is not working\n\nUpdate! I kind of got past that issues by running sudo apt install build-essential\n\nHowever! I get another error now (again just jumping from error to error). This error says:\n\nCalledProcessError: Command '\\['/usr/bin/gcc', '/tmp/tmpaugn0b5t/main.c', '-O3', '-shared', '-fPIC', '-o', '/tmp/tmpaugn0b5t/cuda\\_utils.cpython-312-x86\\_64-linux-gnu.so', '-lcuda', '-L/home/magnus/code/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/triton/backends/nvidia/lib', '-L/usr/lib/wsl/lib', '-I/home/magnus/code/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/triton/backends/nvidia/include', '-I/tmp/tmpaugn0b5t', '-I/usr/include/python3.12'\\]' returned non-zero exit status 1.Output is truncated. View as a scrollable element or open in a text editor. Adjust cell output settings...\n\nIf i click on full cell output there is a library worth of text. I think the main error is : returned non-zero exit status\n\nwould really appreciate some insight on this as well!\n\n  \nI havent been able to solve it but this issue thread seem to talk about the same thing:  \n[\n\nThat packges are incomateble.
