Your whole project - phases, tasks, iterations, brainstorming, decisions, implementation notes, EVERYTHING.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSmall projects? Fine.  \nReal projects? You're scrolling through 2,000+ lines trying to find where you were. AI has to read the entire file to understand context. It sucked.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The fix (v1.3.0):**\n\n\u00a0\n\nSplit it into multiple files that actually make sense:\n\n    DASHBOARD.md         \u2192 \"I'm on Phase 2, Task 3, Iteration 2\"\n    PLAN.md              \u2192 \"Here's WHY we built it this way\"\n    phase-2/task-3.md    \u2192 The actual work for that task\n    \n\n**Why it's so much better:**\n\n* Open [DASHBOARD.md]( see exactly where you are\n* Jump to that one task file (\\~200 lines, not 2,000)\n* AI reads only what matters for the current work\n* Your brain doesn't explode from context switching\n\n  \n**The philosophy behind it:**\n\nFlow isn't about letting AI do whatever it wants. It's about YOU driving and AI executing within YOUR framework.\n\nThe multi-file structure makes this crystal clear: PLAN.md is your architectural decisions (rarely changes), DASHBOARD.md is your progress tracker (changes constantly), task files are your actual work.\n\nEverything documented. Nothing forgotten. Works across sessions, weeks, months.\n\n\n\n**Why I'm posting this:**\n\nBecause it's Opensource, free (MIT license), I fucking love using it, and I want other people to try it.   \nNot trying to sell anything - this is just a tool I built that makes working with AI actually sustainable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you've ever had an AI \"forget\" your entire project structure between sessions, or rewrite something you explicitly said not to touch, Flow might click for you.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGitHub:\u00a0[\n\n\u00a0\n\nBuilt with Claude, works with any AI (copy paste prompts - working on solutions for other AI providers).
