For example, the word \"house\" has 340 synonyms, phrases and inflections. The program uses all the synonyms, phrases, foreign words and inflections and has 3 search modes. One of them is the one that recognizes the meaning of the phrase being searched for.\n\nI am trying to spread the word about these new programs and I am also interested in meeting people working in computational linguistics.\n\nI have the website xxx and also the YouTube channel xxx where demo videos are shown.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and receive a cordial greeting.\n\nAdditional text:\n\nAmong the projects I am working on are:\n\n\\- A large library of functions that recognizes desktop and web languages \u200b\u200band controls.\n\n\\- A semantic search engine called xxx in desktop and web version, which is a program that uses a semantic search engine and works for the Spanish, Catalan and English languages \u200b\u200band their foreign words.\n\n\\- A coding program called xxx, which is a program that uses an encryption engine.\n\n\\- An annotation editor called xxx that works with containers.\n\n\\- A program to share computer information called xxx.\n\n\\- A program to connect from computer to computer, local or remote, and exchange messages called xxx.\n\nI have also developed programs to manage information about languages, to index information and to extract information intelligently. In addition, I work with large databases that store complete information about various languages.\n\nAll these programs are in advanced versions, so they are quite revised and I am now working on new versions.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and receive my best regards.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1hylmvu/semantic_search_engine_difficulty_in_promoting/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open source Flux image generation Discord bot with LLM-based chat", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/sneezeparty/soupy", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A simple GUI application for managing NFS drives on Windows", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/yani-/windows-nfs-manager", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Millions of people's 'intimate' location data stolen in major hack", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/millions-of-peoples-intimate-location-data-stolen-in-major-hack-13286722", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Newsom confirms Mexico sending firefighters to help California", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/mexican-firefighters-los-angeles-california-wildfires-palisades-2013444", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel has killed many more people in Gaza than reported, top health study says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-killed-many-more-people-gaza-people-reported-the-lancet-found/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US plans to restrict Nvidia AI chips exports to india incl.", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/qr3kb4tkucce1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is the Assyrian civilization underrated?", "summary": "The more I read about Assyrian civilization the more I think it is wildly underrated in comparison with other ancient civilizations.
