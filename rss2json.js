That would require a three-fifths majority of MPs, and it remains unclear if that will be possible.\n\nIn September, parliament\u00a0[approved](\u00a0a bill that would have banned the chaining of dogs at home and also introduced minimum sizes of kennels that dogs can be kept in.\n\nThe measure was supported by Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right, but also some MPs from the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, including its leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski.\n\nHowever, after the bill reached Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition, he\u00a0[decided](\u00a0to exercise his right to veto. Nawrocki argued that, \u201calthough the intention \u2013 protecting animals \u2013 is just and noble, the law itself was poorly drafted\u201d.\n\nIn particular, the president said that elements of the legislation introducing minimum sizes for dog kennels \u2013 of at least 20m\u00b2 for the largest dogs \u2013 were unrealistic and would \u201charm farmers, breeders and ordinary rural households\u201d.\n\nNawrocki proposed his own bill that includes a ban on chaining dogs at home. However, W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament,\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that he would instead seek to overturn the president\u2019s veto on the original bill.\n\nThat would be an extremely rare occurrence: the last time a presidential veto was overturned by parliament was in 2009. But Czarzasty appeared to have a chance of success given that the dog-chaining ban received the support of over three-fifths of MPs when it was approved by parliament in September.\n\nHowever, it appears likely that most, if not all, of the PiS MPs who voted in favour of the bill initially will not support overturning the veto of Nawrocki, who was elected this year with PiS\u2019s backing and has generally supported the party\u2019s agenda since taking office. That would likely mean the veto will not be overturned.\n\nIn a United Surveys poll published on Sunday by the Wirtualna Polska news website, 61% of respondents said they opposed Nawrocki\u2019s veto while 36% supported it. Participants in Sunday\u2019s march appealed to MPs to vote to overturn it, rather than accept the president\u2019s proposed alternative.\n\n\u201cWe stand here today because we refuse to accept suffering, which is still legal in Poland, because a dog on a chain, a dog confined in a cramped area, is a suffering dog,\u201d said Robert Ma\u015blak, an expert in animal welfare from the University of Wroc\u0142aw.\n\nMa\u015blak said that banning chaining alone would not be enough because studies show that dogs kept in confined spaces suffer stress, which leads to behavioural disorders. That in turn can make animals aggressive and more of a threat to humans.\n\n\u201cReplacing the chain with a cramped kennel does not solve the problem,\u201d he warned, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/15/thousands-march-in-protest-against-polish-presidents-veto-of-dog-chaining-ban/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Epstein\u2019s UK flights had alleged British abuse victims on board, BBC finds - BBC News", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4709kylkxo.amp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Reddit launches high court challenge to Australia\u2019s under-16s social media ban", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/12/reddit-high-court-challenge-social-media-ban-australia-under-16s", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mysterious interstellar comet set to make closest approach to Earth this week", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-earth-approach-friday-b2884724.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "4 charged with plotting New Year\u2019s Eve attacks in Southern California, prosecutors say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/15/los-angeles-plot-turtle-island-liberation-front-00690708", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany to deploy troops to Poland to help bolster eastern flank defences", "summary": "Germany will send soldiers to Poland next year to support its neighbour\u2019s efforts to strengthen its borders with Russia and Belarus, which are also NATO and the European Union\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nThe news was first revealed to journalists last week by Polish deputy defence minister Pawe\u0142 Zalewski after a meeting with his German counterpart Nils Schmid, reported\u00a0*Bild*.\n\nThe newspaper then received confirmation from the German defence ministry that a \u201cmid-double-digit number of soldiers\u201d would be deployed to Poland from the second quarter of 2026 until the end of 2027.\n\nThe troops will support implementation of Poland\u2019s East Shield operation, which seeks to bolster defences along the borders with Belarus and Russia. The German personnel will mainly engage in engineering work, such as digging trenches, laying barbed wire and constructing anti-tank barriers.\n\nBecause the deployment is not an armed foreign mission and the soldiers are not expected to be exposed to military conflict, it does not require parliamentary approval.\n\nPoland\u2019s defence ministry has not yet officially commented on the deployment.\n\nEast Shield was\u00a0[launched by Poland in 2024](\u00a0with a budget of 10 billion zloty (\u20ac2.4 billion) to be spent over four years to bolster security in preparation for \u2013 but also in the hope of deterring \u2013 a potential attack by Russia.\u00a0[Some of the funds](\u00a0will come from the EU\u2019s new Security Action for Europe (SAFE) programme.\n\nThe operation aims to construct an array of physical infrastructure, such as bunkers, minefields and anti-tank obstacles, as well as electronic elements including satellite monitoring, thermal imaging cameras and anti-drone systems.\n\nAs part of its plans to implement those new defences, Poland has\u00a0[withdrawn from the Ottawa Treaty]( which bans the use of anti-personnel landmines. Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have done the same.\n\nIn September, after multiple Russian drones\u00a0[violated Polish airspace](\u00a0in an unprecedented incursion into NATO territory, Germany was\u00a0[among the allied countries](\u00a0that pledged to increase support for Poland.\n\nEarlier this month, Germany deployed five Eurofighter aircraft and 150 associated personnel to Poland\u00a0as part of NATO\u2019s enhanced air policing mission.\n\n\u201cOur deployment to Poland highlights Germany\u2019s unwavering commitment to the shared security of the Euro-Atlantic area,\u201d said the detachment\u2019s commander, quoted by NATO.\n\n\u201cAs a partner and ally, we stand with Poland,\u201d added Schmid during his visit this week to the German personnel posted in Poland. Zalewski said that the Eurofighter deployment \u201cdemonstrates the seriousness of Germany\u2019s contribution to the defence of the eastern flank\u201d, reports news website Defence24.\n\nHowever, Germany\u2019s newly announced decision to send forces to support the East Shield operation was condemned by a prominent Polish nationalist, Robert B\u0105kiewicz, who at the 2023 parliamentary elections\u00a0[stood as a candidate](\u00a0for the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which is now Poland\u2019s main opposition.\n\n\u201cThis is a scandal. The German army is going to guard Polish borders.
