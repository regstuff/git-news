I've familiarized myself with python and pytorch and done numerous self-driven projects; I've customized a Mistral chatbot and added RAG, used RAG to enhance translation in LLM prompts, and put together a simple sentiment analysis Discord bot. I've been interested in NLP technologies for years, and I've been enjoying learning about them more and actually building things. My challenge is this: although I can do a lot with python and I'm learning more all the time, I don't have a computer science degree. I got stuck on a Wav2Vec2 finetuning project when I couldn't get my tensor inputs formatted in just the right way. I feel as though the expected input format wasn't clear in the documentation, but that's very likely because of my inexperience. My homebrew German-English translation Transformer project stalled when I realized my laptop wouldn't be able to train it within a decade. And of course, I can barely accomplish anything without lots of tutorials, googling, and attempts to get chatGPT to find the errors in my code (at which it often fails).\n\n\n\nIn short, my NLP and python skills are present and improving but half-baked in my estimation. I have a lot of experience with language learning and teaching, but I don't wish to continue relying on only those skills.
