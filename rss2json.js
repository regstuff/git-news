The results have been surprising - I'm catching mental blindspots I never knew I had.\n\nHere are 5 of my favorite prompts that might help you too:\n\n# The Assumption Detector\n\nWhen you're convinced about something:\n\n    \"I believe [your belief]. What hidden assumptions am I making? What evidence might contradict this?\"\n\nThis has saved me from multiple bad decisions by revealing beliefs I had accepted without evidence.\n\n# The Devil's Advocate\n\nWhen you're in love with your own idea:\n\n    \"I'm planning to [your idea]. If you were trying to convince me this is a terrible idea, what would be your most compelling arguments?\"\n\nThis one hurt my feelings but saved me from launching a business that had a fatal flaw I was blind to.\n\n# The Ripple Effect Analyzer\n\nBefore making a big change:\n\n    \"I'm thinking about [potential decision]. Beyond the obvious first-order effects, what might be the unexpected second and third-order consequences?\"\n\nThis revealed long-term implications of a career move I hadn't considered.\n\n# The Blind Spot Illuminator\n\nWhen facing a persistent problem:\n\n    \"I keep experiencing [problem] despite [your solution attempts]. What factors might I be overlooking?\"\n\nUsed this with my team's productivity issues and discovered an organizational factor I was completely missing.\n\n# The Status Quo Challenger\n\nWhen \"that's how we've always done it\" isn't working:\n\n    \"We've always [current approach], but it's not working well. Why might this traditional approach be failing, and what radical alternatives exist?\"\n\nThis helped me redesign a process that had been frustrating everyone for years.\n\nThese are just 5 of the 13 prompts I've developed. Each one exercises a different cognitive muscle, helping you see problems from angles you never considered.\n\nI've written a\u00a0[detailed guide with all 13 prompts and examples](\u00a0if you're interested in the full toolkit.\n\nWhat thinking techniques do you use to challenge your own assumptions?

However, when I upload the same notebook to Azure ML Studio, I can't run it. I installed unsloth and unsloth-zoo, but I get an error at the very first step:\n\n    from unsloth import FastLanguageModel\n\nI suppose the issue is related to version incompatibilities between unsloth and the pre-installed libraries in Azure ML \u2014 such as torch, transformers, or accelerate.  \n  \n I thought it's like a common problem especially for Azure ML studio because I've seen only solutions for Colab and Kaggle .  Well, my steps are !pip install unsloth. \n\nThen I see the message that \"tf-keras is not installed, p-lease use !pip install tf-keras.\"\n\nBut when I install tf-keras (which wasn't a necessary step in Colab though) I see: ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

this is the wrong subreddit. \n\nI am building a pronunciation tutor where I extract phonemes from the users speech and compare it against the target phrases phonemes (ARPABET representation).\n\nI have been able to implement longest common subsequence to find where the phonemes are wrong but I am having trouble showing visual feedback to the user such as what parts of the word they mispronounced. \n\nFor example: 'the' is \\['DH', 'AH'\\]. If user says \\['D', 'AH'\\], then I should highlight 'th' in 'the' red.\n\nI have a work around right now where each phoneme maps to a certain number of characters. So 'DH' maps to 2 characters and 'AH' maps to 1. I know this is a very simple approach and it doesn't work when phonemes correspond to either 1 or 2 characters. For instance, phoneme  'L' corresponds to one l like in 'lie' and is also mapped to two ls like in 'smell'.\n\nMaybe I am overcomplicating the problem but the way I see it I need some way to take in the word as context as to how the phonemes are alligned with the characters. I have no idea where to begin.

So I apologize in advance. This is my first time on Reddit so I\u2019m unsure of the etiquette, please forgive me. \n\nI was recently offered a job outside of archaeology. It pays extremely well and has big gaps in between jobs, so I would be able to get back into archaeology in between those! However, I was hit with the hiring freeze on fed jobs. \n\nA bump in the road never stopped me, though! In the event this opportunity doesn\u2019t work out, I wanted to see about next steps for me. I have my undergrad in anthropology with an archaeology minor. I\u2019m looking into grad programs now. I did archaeology before the pandemic hit (CRM), though sadly I didn\u2019t do it long enough to get a feel of the field because of the pandemic. I had started teaching social studies after that. \n\nHow could I (with about a year experience) get into projects outside of the U.S.? I know they exist, but is it all networking? Is there a website? Do I make a wish with the tooth fairy?I would love to get into some digs and surveys! I mean, what I would REALLY love to do is study cultures and people - more the anthro side, but I don\u2019t have time for that. \n\nAny into would be much appreciated!

The cost of out of state tuition is so high that I\u2019m considering staying home and doing community college for a year to save up. Is this a bad idea? Will it look bad in the future when I want to go to grad school and become an archaeologist? I\u2019m really passionate about this field and feel like I\u2019m stuck.
