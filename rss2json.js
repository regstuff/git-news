Increased presence of military in the region, Pakistan going through its economic crisis among the primary ones but one of the major factors among that was also the fact that then Army Chief Qamar Bajwa wanted normalised relations with India. There were even reports of backdoor channel talks at NSA levels between India and Pakistan during this period.\n\nThat changed when Bajwa was succeeded by Asim Munir. Asim Munir is an ideological man. He believes in two nations theory. He believes in Islamic supremacy. His talk to Pakistan diaspora was already a warning which India did not pay enough attention to and as a result we got Pahelgam massacre.\n\n4 months later, Asim Munir reaping the rewards of his gamble. He is \"promoted\" to Field Marshal. Pakistan is slowly ending its isolation due to better relations with USA and Saudi Arabia (There are definitely causal links between Operation Sindoor and the recent geopolitical waves but I am not going to delve on that in this post). How much of this will meaningfully translate to Pakistan's well-being in the long run only time will tell but what it definitely does is, it gives more leverage and validation to Asim Munir's propaganda and his methods to Pakistan public. They definitely think that he's their messiah now and he can do no wrong. This will embolden him to take even more risks like Pahelgam.\n\nIf you think India was isolated during Operation Sindoor, imagine what happens after the next, say even bigger, terrorist attack. The first thing that will happen is backdoor arm-twisting by Saudi Arabia and USA for India to not escalate the tensions. Operation Sindoor did not achieve enough strategic deterrents, in my opinion and India caved under the pressure for the early ceasefire before achieving strategic goals (Destroying 2-3 strategic airbases at the cost losing expensive military hardware is not achieving goals). \n\nFollowing this reasoning, what's to stop Asim Munir from escalating this nonsense? We already seeing multiple ceasefire violations at the LOC.

But the military did not carry out such widespread demolitions in previous Gaza City operations.\n\nThis time is different.\n\nThough much of the city is still standing, satellite images show Israeli forces are destroying whole areas as they sweep into Gaza City, including the [Zeitoun neighborhood]( and an area near Sheikh Radwan, where the military has demolished dozens of structures this month.\n\nPreviously, Israeli troops advanced through Gaza City and then withdrew \u2013 only to return later to fight what they said was a renewed Hamas insurgency. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said this time around was different because the military would hold areas it seized. But even many Israelis are skeptical that this strategy will succeed now, as Hamas has proven resilient in the face of nearly two years of devastating war.\n\nBefore the current offensive, most buildings in Gaza City were damaged. Many were uninhabitable, but they were largely still standing, especially toward the center of town.\n\nEarlier this summer, Israel flattened areas around the city near the Israeli border.\n\nOn Aug. 8, the Israeli government [approved a plan]( to take control of Gaza City.
