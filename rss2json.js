And since then, as we already know, their relationship with the Pakistani establishment has been constantly [deteriorating]( which in turns gives an unsolicited leverage to India.\n\nIndia has already been quietly reaching out to the Taliban now. For years, India would refuse to send diplomats formally even to multilateral meetings on Afghanistan that had Taliban representatives. \n\nThat [changed]( first, when on Aug 31st 2021, days after the takeover, India\u2019s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal went on to met the Taliban\u2019s FM in Doha.\n\nThen, on June 2022, Indian diplomats [met]( Taliban officials in Kabul. And since then, India has been sending [large volumes of wheat]( to Afghanistan in coordination with the Taliban government, to help ease their hunger crisis. In return, the Taliban has also thanked India for it's humanitarian assistance on multiple occasions (see [here]( [here]( and [here]( which is a drastic change in itself, considering India's previous policy of supporting the Anti-Taliban 'Northern Alliance' during the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nAnd yet, India, like most of the other nations, has not recognised the new regime. Additionally, they've not yet established a new embassy and the previous regime's embassy has been shut down.\n\nOn the other hand, Taliban is quickly gaining international recognition from rival powers like China which [sent]( a new ambassador to Kabul in September. With [Iran]( [the UAE]( [Russia]( and [Qatar]( already warming their ties, it further diminishes any perception of India being viewed as a lone nation walking towards that path. The Taliban has also been urging India to [resume]( it's infrastructure projects like electricity generation and road building works, which got suspended after the takeover. India, however, has not yet indicated that it will review its position on the Taliban.\n\nSo putting all of this in context begs the burning question, is it finally the time to embrace a pragmatic and 'realpolitik' approach to our ties? If yes, then how would it affect our global image? What would we gain, and is there really anything of value to lose here (in terms of security concerns related to Kashmir, with was raised during the takeover)?\n\nSources/Further reading:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1fldnre/is_it_the_finally_the_right_time_for_india_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Made a password concealer/manager using lsb image steganography.
