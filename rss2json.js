His remarks were condemned by \u017burek, who said that the authorities \u201cwill not allow anyone to express such views with impunity\u201d.\n\nOn Saturday, Braun held a press conference in the town of O\u015bwi\u0119cim, which was where Nazi Germany established the\u00a0[Auschwitz camp](\u00a0during the occupation of Poland in World War Two. Around 1.1 million people were killed there, the vast majority of them Jews.\n\nBraun used the event to condemn plans outlined last month by the justice ministry for the government to adopt a new National Strategy for Counteracting Anti-Semitism and Supporting Jewish Life. The document is set to receive cabinet approval by the end of this year.\n\nBraun, a member of the European Parliament who\u00a0[finished fourth in this year\u2019s presidential elections]( condemned the plan, saying that the fact it \u201csingles out one particular group\u2026\\[for\\] special privileges\u2026is tantamount to discrimination against all Polish citizens of non-Jewish descent\u201d.\n\nWorse than that, he argued, promoting Jewish life in Poland was like \u201cinviting Hannibal Lecter to move in next door\u201d. He said that Israeli brutality in Gaza shows how Jews believe that \u201cnon-Jews are not people\u201d and claimed that, for them, \u201cthere is no difference between Palestinian and Polish children\u201d.\n\nBraun, who has a long history of conspiratorial antisemitism, declared that \u201cthe Warsaw government is implementing directives presented\u2026by various Jewish organisations\u201d.\n\nHe said that one element of that has been the way in which control of the site of Auschwitz has been taken away from Poles, despite the fact that they were victims of the camp. Braun said that his own relatives died in Nazi-German camps, including Auschwitz.\n\nYet \u201cI, with my historical memory, and my fellow Poles are now second-class citizens here\u201d, declared Braun. \u201cPolish themes in the history of World War II are being devalued\u2026\\[by\\] those representing state institutions and state services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Poland, not Polin,\u201d he declared, referring to the name of Poland in Hebrew and Yiddish. That phase is often used by Braun and his supporters to suggest that Jews are seeking to control Poland. \u201cThis is Poland, and on Polish territory there can be no other authority but Poland.\u201d\n\nHe then addressed police officers who had been posted to his event, saying that they risked being turned into \u201csome kind of ghetto police, harassing your own compatriots at the whistling of Jews\u201d. During the German occupation, the Nazis set up\u00a0[Jewish police forces](\u00a0to exert control in the ghettos.\n\nBraun\u2019s speech was quickly condemned by \u017burek, who told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that \u201cthere is no place for antisemitism in Poland, and such statements dramatically harm the Polish state on the international stage, but also in our own country\u201d.\n\n\u017burek \u2013 who, as well as serving as justice minister, is also prosecutor general \u2013 said that Braun\u2019s \u201cscandalous and unacceptable\u201d comments would be investigated.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow anyone to express such views with impunity. We will pursue them resolutely. It is truly shameful for Poles that someone like this, in the 21st century, after what happened in Poland during World War Two, is turning this place \\[Auschwitz\\] into some hideous political game.\u201d\n\n\u017burek noted that he has recently personally signed a\u00a0[request for Braun\u2019s immunity](\u00a0as a member of the European Parliament to be lifted following\u00a0[comments](\u00a0in which he said that the gas chambers at Auschwitz were \u201cfake\u201d. The denial of Nazi crimes is illegal in Poland.\n\nBraun has already been\u00a0[stripped of immunity twice](\u00a0this year by the European Parliament to face a variety of charges, including for inciting religious hatred against Jews and\u00a0[attacking a\u00a0Jewish religious celebration](\u00a0in the Polish parliament with a fire extinguisher.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/24/polish-justice-minister-pledges-investigation-into-far-right-leaders-auschwitz-speech/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK navy intercepts Russian corvette and tanker as Moscow steps up naval activity", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/royal-navy-yantar-spy-ships-english-channel-4243184fbfe591a38556907923ad50a1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel says Hezbollah chief of staff killed in first strike on Beirut in months | CNN", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-beirut-strikes-intl", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Western leaders say 28-point Ukraine peace plan needs \u201cadditional work\u201d", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/western-leaders-us-28-point-ukraine-peace-plan-reaction-trump/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Centre of Pokrovsk cleared of Russians, they can't hold positions there \u2013 Ukraine's Air Assault Forces", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/11/23/8008598/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Up to 50,000 nurses could quit UK over immigration plans, survey suggests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/20/up-to-50000-nurses-could-quit-uk-over-immigration-plans-survey-suggests", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Including 8,654 civilians | 11,226 people killed in Syria since fall of Al-Assad regime", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.syriahr.com/en/373033/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "BREAKING: Nigerian Army Dismisses Four Soldiers Fighting Boko Haram For \u2018Disobeying Standing Order\u2019", "summary": "Note:- At times, Nigerian news uses Boko Haram colloquially to refer to Islamist gunmen.", "link": "https://saharareporters.com/2025/11/19/breaking-nigerian-army-dismisses-four-soldiers-fighting-boko-haram-disobeying-standing", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Insecurity: criminals, kidnappers, herdsmen disguise as IPOB/ESN  \u2013  Nextier experts", "summary": "Note:- IPOB/ESN are separatist agitators.

The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.\n\n&gt;One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.\n\n&gt;Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war ... *The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.*\n\n&gt;*What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine\u2019s looming defeat \u2013 the Ukrainian president himself.*\n\n&gt;Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built.\n\n&gt;Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as \u201cBiden\u2019s war\u201d, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.\n\n&gt;It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.\n\n&gt;To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.\n\n&gt;The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.\n\n&gt;But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.\n\n&gt;The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine\u2019s negotiating position. *Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy\u2019s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility*", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/23/a-corruption-scandal-may-well-end-the-war-in-ukraine", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
