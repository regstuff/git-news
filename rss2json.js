The island is suffering from combined viruses that include dengue, chikungunya, Oropouche and other respiratory diseases\n\nCuba today is indeed a country of sick citizens who do not know exactly what they are suffering from. All they know is that they are being infected by \u201cthe virus\u201d \u2013 a sinister ghost that has drifted across the entire island, wiping out its inhabitants. First come the high fevers, then red spots develop, or else peeling skin. Vomiting, diarrhea and headaches are inevitable. The hands and knees swell. Victims can barely stand on their feet, and there are those who have not walked again even after the worst is over. A limp indicates a virus survivor. Citizens who drag their legs or complain about achy joints have likely also been hit.\n\nAlmost all families in Cuba have had someone sick at home due to the country\u2019s epidemiological crisis. The disease is in fact a combination of several mosquito-borne viruses, a model of \u201ccombined arboviruses\u201d that includes [dengue, Oropouche and chikungunya]( as well as other respiratory viruses such as H1N influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, [and Covid-19]( According to figures published by the Ministry of Public Health, 5,717 new cases of chikungunya were reported in the last week, bringing the number of patients suffering from it to 38,938. As for dengue, the ministry said the disease remains active in the country\u2019s 14 provinces and 113 municipalities.\n\nAn alarming 33 deaths were reported at the beginning of the week which the government was forced to recognize, including 21 minors \u2013 the demographic most affected by these arboviruses along with the elderly.\n\nNow, with hospitals and morgues overflowing, it is difficult for the ministry to ignore the evidence, though many Cubans maintain that the number of the ill and the dead is far higher than the state is willing to acknowledge. The government has managed to disguise the figures by issuing death certificates that fail to mention arboviruses.\n\nFinally, the Cuban government has been left with no choice but to recognize the \u201cnational epidemiological situation\u201d that has Cubans in a state of panic. The outlook is so critical that some have appealed to the international community not to let their so-called diseased ship sink with its millions of people on board. While state officials downplay the matter, insisting that it is not an outbreak exclusive to Cuba, and that cases are being reported in Brazil and Colombia, the truth is that the general shortages and [state of collapse in Cuba]( have severely undermined the authorities\u2019 ability to control the disease.\n\nThe country suffers a 70% deficit of medication supplies but what worries Cubans most is the lack of proper diagnostic procedures in health institutions that can tell them what type of virus they are suffering from. It was reported that they were discarding the samples a lot of the time because there were no reagents to process them, and the patients were given a negative result.\n\nSeveral Cubans interviewed by EL PA\u00cdS are concerned that the dearth of good food is damaging their chances of recovery. A nutritional guide to which EL PA\u00cdS had access, circulated by the Pedro Kour\u00ed Institute (IPK), reports that, among other things, chikungunya consumes iron reserves, decreases albumin and other proteins, and raises C-reactive protein, all factors that weaken [the immune system]( According to IPK, a prestigious research center for infectious disease, it is vital to eat eggs, yogurt, whey, fish such as salmon, tuna or sardines, vegetables, nuts and certain grains. Most of these products are inaccessible to most Cubans.", "link": "https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-12-14/we-are-dying-cuba-sinks-into-a-health-crisis-amid-medicine-shortages-and-misdiagnosis.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dmitry Medvedev threatens Volodymyr Zelensky over alleged drone attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/international/5666558-russia-threatens-ukraine-president/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yemen declares state of emergency after separatists seize territory", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yemen-declares-state-of-emergency-after-separatists-seize-territory/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel Strips U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees of Diplomatic Immunity", "summary": "Israel already banned UNRWA last year, alleging that Hamas had fundamentally compromised its Gaza branch. The legislation barred the agency from all contact with the Israeli authorities, hampering its operations in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nUNRWA says Israel is trying to discredit the agency, which provides education and heath care to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East. The group\u2019s officials say Israel has provided no proof for its claims of sweeping misconduct by its employees.\n\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war began, UNRWA played a key role in distributing food, medicine and other aid to Palestinians during the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The agency\u2019s schools were converted into shelters hosting displaced Palestinians.\n\nThat changed after last year\u2019s ban, which severely hobbled the U.N. agency\u2019s efforts in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel stopped providing new visas for UNRWA staff members to travel to Israel and Gaza; as a result, its East Jerusalem offices are now largely vacant.\n\nIsrael accuses Hamas, which seized full control of Gaza in 2007, of extensively infiltrating UNRWA. The Israeli military has said more than 10 percent of the group\u2019s employees are members of Hamas and other armed groups, without providing evidence.\n\nAn UNRWA spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFounded in 1949, UNRWA serves Palestinians displaced by the wars surrounding the founding of Israel, as well as their descendants. More than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were forced from their homes in what became Israel, and the agency grants refugee status to them and their descendants, who now number about six million.\n\nIsraeli officials have bristled at both the existence of a special agency for Palestinians and allowing their children and grandchildren to also claim the status of refugees. They have long argued that UNRWA perpetuates the conflict by tacitly encouraging Palestinians to seek a right of return to Israel.\n\nUNRWA\u2019s role was particularly pronounced in Gaza, where the agency said it had registered more than 1.5 million people as refugees. Its schools and health clinics \u2014 as well as the salaries paid to its employees \u2014 provided a modicum of stability in the impoverished enclave.\n\nSince Israel began leveling its accusations, the agency has denied that it has been compromised, saying that it even regularly shared its employee rosters with Israel.\n\nIsraeli officials also accused at least 19 UNRWA employees of participating in the 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel. A subsequent U.N. inquiry found that at least nine employees may have participated in the assault, leading to their dismissal. The organization employs about 12,000 people in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn October, the International Court of Justice ordered the Israeli government not to interfere with UNRWA\u2019s work in the West Bank and Gaza. The court told Israel to \u201cagree to and facilitate\u201d attempts to provide aid there \u201cby all means at its disposal\u201d \u2014 including UNRWA.\n\n[\n\nEdit: restoring missing text from article not in the archive link", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-diplomatic-immunity.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Blair pressured officials over case of UK soldiers accused of beating Iraqi man to death, files show", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/30/tony-blair-pressured-officials-case-uk-soldiers-iraq-files?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Saudi Arabia bombs Yemen port over weapons shipment from UAE, issues warning to Abu Dhabi", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-bomb-yemen-mukalla-weapons-uae-9fc56e4678a12f56d61b1ecf855d4a4e", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Protests spread across Iran for third day after currency hits record low", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj2llkjv8vo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Coalition of Willing to meet in Ukraine for security talks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/coalition-of-willing-to-meet-in-ukraine-for-security-talks/3785216", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Syrian arrested in Dutch port city suspected of Christmas terrorist attack plot in Europe", "summary": "", "link": "https://nltimes.nl/2025/12/30/syrian-arrested-dutch-port-city-suspected-christmas-terrorist-attack-plot-europe", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Protests spread across Iran for third day after currency hits record low", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj2llkjv8vo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran's government offers dialogue as protests spread to universities", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-government-offers-dialogue-protesters-2025-12-30/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "African Union Rejects Recognition Of Somaliland, Reaffirms Support For Somalia\u2019s Unity", "summary": "", "link": "https://saharareporters.com/2025/12/27/african-union-rejects-recognition-somaliland-reaffirms-support-somalias-unity", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish government seeks to end deadlock with president over security", "summary": "  \nPoland\u2019s defence and security service ministers have asked for a meeting with opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki in an apparent effort to calm the conflict between the government and presidential palace over issues relating to national security.\n\n\u201cState security requires the cooperation of all constitutional bodies, regardless of political disputes,\u201d said defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz.\n\n\u201cTherefore, \\[security services minister\\] Tomasz Siemoniak and I have submitted a request for a meeting with the president with the participation of the heads of services,\u201d he added. \u201cWe hope for a positive response.\u201d\n\nKosiniak-Kamysz said that, if the meeting takes place, he and Siemoniak aim to \u201cpresent plans for 2026, budgetary and also those for which information is classified\u201d, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nThe government\u2019s budget for 2026 is set to be approved by parliament in January, after which it will be sent to Nawrocki for approval. While the president cannot veto the budget, he can send it to the constitutional court for assessment, which can delay and, in theory, even prevent its adoption.\n\nKosiniak-Kamysz and Siemoniak noted that, as well as\u00a0[increasing defence spending to 4.8% of GDP]( the budget earmarks record amounts for the\u00a0Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW), Internal Security Agency (ABW) and the Foreign Intelligence Agency (AW).\n\nSince coming to power in August, Nawrocki has regularly clashed with the government, including\u00a0[vetoing an unprecedented number of laws]( As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he has also expressed concern over the government\u2019s management of security-related issues.\n\nThe president has regularly accused the government of preventing him and his representatives from receiving vital national-security information. In some cases, the government has said that this is because Nawrocki\u2019s chief security aide\u00a0[does not have security clearance](\n\nSpeaking today, Siemoniak claimed that \u201cboth the president and his officials are kept informed on the most important issues\u201d, reports news website Interia.\n\nLast month, Nawrocki announced that he would not sign off on the appointment of 136 newly qualified SKW and ABW officers because the government was preventing him from meeting with the heads of the security services.\n\n\u201cIf the government is unwilling to meet with the president, if the heads of the security services are unwilling to meet with the president, this undoubtedly negatively impacts the security of Poland,\u201d said presidential spokesman Rafa\u0142 Le\u015bkiewicz at the time.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk condemned Nawrocki\u2019s decision \u201ca continuation of the president\u2019s war on the Polish government\u201d. However, Le\u015bkiewicz said that the officers \u201care, in fact, hostages of a political game played by the government\u201d.\n\nSpeaking today, Siemoniak said he and Kosiniak-Kamysz hoped the proposed meeting with Nawrocki would allow them to finally \u201cresolve the painful issue of officer nominations\u201d.\n\nAt the time of writing, neither Nawrocki nor his office had responded to the government\u2019s invitation.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/29/polish-government-seeks-to-end-deadlock-with-president-over-security/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland signs deal to produce South Korean missiles domestically", "summary": "Poland, in cooperation with South Korean partners, will for the first time produce guided missiles domestically under a deal worth more than 14 billion zloty (\u20ac3.3 billion).\n\nUnder the agreement, signed between the state treasury and a consortium made up of Poland\u2019s WB Electronics and South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Aerospace, Poland will manufacture more than 10,000 CGR-080 precision-guided missiles.\n\nThey are used by the K239 Chunmoo rocket artillery systems, hundreds of which Poland has purchased from South Korea, with their Polish variant known as Homar-K. The missiles, which have a range of 80 kilometres, are due to be delivered to the Polish armed forces between 2030 and 2033.\n\nAs part of the deal, a missile production facility will be built in the Polish city of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski and operated by Hanwha WB Advanced System, a joint venture between WB Electronics and Hanwha Aerospace.\n\nThe agreement, which provides for the transfer of missile production technology from South Korea to Poland, will help the Polish \u201cdefence industry acquire new capabilities\u201d, declared the Polish defence ministry.\n\n\u201cFor us, selecting the best suppliers is crucial, but equally important, and sometimes even more important, is that production takes place in Poland,\u201d said defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about thousands of missiles and a contract worth billions of zlotys \u2013 this is an investment in our security and economy for many years to come,\u201d he added.\n\nThe agreement was also welcomed by Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff to South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.

How has this Sahelian group moved from local self-defence to transnational crime and extremist activity?", "summary": "ABSTRACT\n\nThis report examines the rise of Lakurawa in northwestern Nigeria, near Niger and Benin. Originating from Mali and Niger with roots in jihad and self-defence, Lakurawa has evolved into a hybrid cross-border group blending jihadism and organised crime. Exploiting weak governance, poverty and insecurity, it uses religion to justify predation, including cattle rustling, crop seizures and oil sabotage. Its recent interactions with a Boko Haram faction heighten the threat. A coordinated, multidimensional cross-border response is urgently needed to address this challenge.\n\nFROM\n\n[", "link": "https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pages/1765344122096-war-47.pdf", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
