Hezbollah is weakened, but its supporters remain defiant. A fragile cease-fire teeters on the edge of collapse. Is this the region\u2019s recipe for never-ending conflict?\n\nSo goes the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, reached a year ago. Almost daily Israeli strikes against Hezbollah, including the killing this week in Beirut of one of the militant group\u2019s top commanders, punctuate a fraying peace. Lebanon exists in a gray zone between war and peace, which could also be the fate of Gaza as Hamas resists disarming and Israel strikes selected targets.\n\nIn effect, the war that spilled into Lebanon after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel has slowed but never stopped.\n\nA morass of mistrust had now led to a dangerous escalation, and the Trump administration\u2019s target for Hezbollah to disarm completely by the end of the year looks implausible.\n\nAcross the region, the United States is pressing to transform the Middle East by new means. \u201cDemocracy\u201d is not part of President Trump\u2019s lexicon. Prosperity, not the ballot box, is put forward as the new panacea. But a journey of several weeks to Lebanon, Israel and Turkey suggests that, for now, renewed war is likelier than spreading peace.\n\nThe situation in Lebanon offers a compelling example of a new Middle East where Israel\u2019s reach is near ubiquitous. The Iran-led \u201caxis of resistance,\u201d of which Hezbollah has been a central part, is a shadow of its former self.\n\nThe region is adapting to what Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates, calls an \u201cimperial Israel,\u201d a country that will kill enemies anywhere: from Lebanon to Syria, Gaza to Iran, Yemen to Qatar. Pre-emptive Israeli strikes are the new norm.\n\nGiven such dominance, the United States will have to decide what constraints, if any, it will impose on Israel in the interests of furthering peace in the region. One way to achieve this may be strengthening the militaries of other regional players, like Saudi Arabia or Turkey, which Mr. Trump seems intent on doing.\n\nFor Hezbollah, diminished but defiant, the adjustment has been severe. It has not responded militarily to Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon, even since they intensified after the Gaza cease-fire last month.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, has hurt Israel\u2019s image, deepened its global isolation and divided Israelis. Against this charged backdrop, it is unclear whether Israel has the political cohesion and will to turn the dominance of its armed forces into strategic security.\n\nThe Lebanese prime minister is determined to establish the Lebanese state\u2019s exclusive right to bear arms. A largely failed state has never achieved this. This goal means disarming Hezbollah, and Mr. Salam\u2019s underpaid, ill-equipped national army is charged with doing that. The drumbeat of Israeli strikes complicates that task on his side of the border. \u201cWe have an unchecked player acting as a hegemon under a leader, Netanyahu, growing stronger by the day,\u201d Mr. Salam told me.\n\nEach death inflicted by Israel, or by either side, seems only to fortify the resolve of its enemies, no matter how weakened, and erode any impulse for peace.\n\nSyria\u2019s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former Sunni jihadist who set up an affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria before moderating his views, is no friend of Iran or of its proxies like Hezbollah.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s grand vision is to combine Gulf capital, Lebanese commercial ingenuity, Israeli technology and a large Arab work force to produce economic miracles that conciliate the Middle East. The United States has had bold but ill-fated plans before in the Middle East.\n\nThe Palestinian people want a state, and it seems inconceivable that money will ever alter that national ambition.

It will also provide billions in revenue at a time when Poland is seeking to tackle rapidly rising public debt.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Nawrocki\u2019s office announced that he had signed 11 bills passed by parliament into law while vetoing a further two.\n\nThe most significant among those he signed was the hike on CIT for banks, which was\u00a0[approved by the Sejm]( the lower house of parliament, last month before minor amendments were added by the upper-house Senate.\n\nAs a result, CIT for banks, which currently stands at 19%, will rise to 30% next year. It will then drop to 26% in 2027, then 23% in 2028, remaining at that level subsequently.\n\nMeanwhile, the banking tax, which is levied on banks\u2019 assets, rather than income, will be reduced from its current rate of 0.0366% to 0.0329% in 2027 and 2028 in 0.0293%.\n\nDuring his campaign for the presidency, Nawrocki promised to oppose any tax increases proposed by the government. However, last month, his chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, told news service [Money.pl]( that the president\u2019s pledge \u201capplies to ordinary Poles\u201d, not \u201clarge entities with enormous resources\u201d.\n\nExplaining his decision to sign the bill today, Nawrocki said that \u201cit is unacceptable that the average citizen or small business bears the tax burden while foreign corporations and large financial institutions generate record profits\u201d.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I decided it was justified to direct a larger portion of these profits to the state, especially in light of growing needs, including those related to financing Poland\u2019s security and the expansion of our armed forces,\u201d he added.\n\nThe government has offered a similar justification for the tax rise, saying that it is a form of \u201csocial justice\u201d given banks\u2019 \u201cexcessive profits\u201d in recent times.\n\nThe Polish Bank Association (ZBP) has strongly opposed the CIT hike, calling it not only \u201cunfair\u201d but also \u201cunconstitutional\u201d as it \u201cviolates the principles of equality, of freedom of economic activity in a social market economy, of rationality, proportionality, and trust in the state and its laws\u201d.\n\nThe finance ministry has previously estimated that the reform will bring in an additional 6.6 billion zloty (\u20ac472 million) in 2026, 4.7 billion in 2027, and up to 2 billion zloty in subsequent years.\n\nThose funds are much needed as Poland recorded the EU\u2019s\u00a0[second-fastest annual rise in public debt](\u00a0in the second quarter of this year. Last year, the country was also\u00a0[placed under the EU\u2019s excessive deficit procedure]( requiring it to take steps to bring public finances under control.\n\nThe country has over the last decade ramped up spending on social benefits, as the former and current governments introduced and expanded popular programmes to support\u00a0[families]( pensioners and other groups.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has also dramatically\u00a0[increased its defence spending]( which now stands at the\u00a0[highest relative level in NATO](", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/27/poland-raises-corporate-income-tax-on-banks-after-president-approves-government-bill/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Taliban used discarded UK kit to track down Afghans who worked with west, inquiry hears | Ministry of Defence", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/28/taliban-used-kit-left-by-uk-to-track-down-afghans-who-worked-with-west-inquiry-hears", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish president vetoes universal access to postal voting due to concern over election interference", "summary": "President Karol Nawrocki has vetoed a bill that would have allowed any voter in Polish elections to submit their ballot by post rather than doing so in person at a polling station.\n\nThe president expressed concern that postal voting creates an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d of foreign interference in ballots sent from abroad. He also warned that it allows \u201cpressure from third parties\u201d on how voters cast their ballot.\n\nCurrently, postal voting is available in three cases: if a voter has a certification showing that they have a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d disability under Polish law, if they are over the age of 60, or if they are in medical quarantine or isolation.\n\nLast month, parliament approved a bill proposed by MPs from the centrist Civic Coalition (KO), Poland\u2019s main ruling party, that would have allowed any voter, in Poland or abroad, to vote by mail in parliamentary and presidential elections if they registered to do so in advance.\n\nThe measure received the approval of the Polish Electoral Commission (PKW), the state body responsible for managing elections, reports Business Insider Polska.\n\nIt was supported in parliament by parties in the KO-led ruling coalition but was opposed by the right-wing opposition, which raised concern that postal voting could make electoral fraud easier.\n\nGiven that Nawrocki is aligned with the opposition and has regularly clashed with the government, that led to speculation that he would exercise his right to veto. On Thursday, the president confirmed that he had done so.\n\n\u201cWhile efforts to promote participation in elections are generally merited, the unregistered mailing of electoral packages abroad, as outlined in the bill, poses a serious risk, as it makes the process dependent on the quality of services provided by postal operators in many countries,\u201d wrote Nawrocki.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, where hybrid threats and interference in the electoral process are real, the lack of full control over the voting process is a serious and unacceptable risk that we cannot take,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president also raised concern that \u201cthe lack of secrecy\u201d inherent to postal voting means that \u201cthere is no guarantee that voters cast their ballots independently, without pressure from third parties\u201d. The bill provided \u201cinsufficient safeguards\u201d against this, he said.\n\nNawrocki also issued an appeal to Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his government to consult with him on proposed laws \u201cat an early stage\u201d in order to \u201cstreamline the legislative process, reduce the need to veto flawed laws, and, above all, serve citizens\u201d.\n\nSince becoming president in August, Nawrocki has already vetoed more bills than his predecessor Andrzej Duda, who was also aligned with the opposition, did in the previous 18 months of cohabiting with Tusk\u2019s government.\n\nThe president\u2019s appeal was, however, rejected by a member of Tusk\u2019s government, Katarzyna Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz, who told Onet Radio that Poland\u2019s constitutional system gives the government and parliament, not the president, the main role in initiating and shaping legislation.\n\nShe also pointed to the fact that, in the government\u2019s recent effort to create a new national park, it engaged with Nawrocki only for the president to anyway\u00a0[issue a veto](\n\nMeanwhile, a former head of Poland\u2019s National Electoral Commission (PKW), Wojciech Hermeli\u0144ski, criticised Nawrocki\u2019s decision to veto the postal-voting bill.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was a good solution,\u201d Hermeli\u0144ski told the\u00a0*Fakt*\u00a0newspaper, saying that it would have benefited diaspora voters in particular, who currently often have to travel very far to a polling station at a Polish embassy or consulate.\n\nHermeli\u0144ski, who is also a former constitutional court judge, said that Nawrocki\u2019s \u201csenseless, mindless series of vetoes\u201d are \u201cnot good for democracy\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/28/polish-president-vetoes-universal-access-to-postal-voting-due-to-concern-over-election-interference/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "BREAKING: Kwara Under Siege As Terrorists Abduct Traditional Ruler In Ifelodun Council Area", "summary": "", "link": "https://saharareporters.com/2025/11/29/breaking-kwara-under-siege-terrorists-abduct-traditional-ruler-ifelodun-council-area", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Number of migrants in asylum seeker hotels rises despite Labour pledge", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-seeker-hotels-figures-rise-labour-b2873529.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
