This summer, I\u2019m torn between two different summer schools, and I have very little time to make a decision.\n\n1) Reinforcement Learning and LLMs for Robotics\nThis is a very niche summer school, with few participants, and relatively unknown as it\u2019s being organized for the first time this year.\nIt focuses on the use of LLMs in robotics \u2014 teaching robots to understand language and execute commands using LLMs.\nThe core idea is to use LLMs to automatically generate reward functions from natural language descriptions of tasks.\nThe speakers include professors from the organizing university, one from KTH, and representatives from two leading companies in the field.\n\n2) Athens NLP Summer School\nThis is the more traditional and well-known summer school, widely recognized in the NLP community.\nIt features prominent speakers from around the world, including Google researchers, and covers a broad range of classical NLP topics.\nHowever, the program is more general and less focused on cutting-edge intersections like robotics.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do.\nThe problem is that I have to choose immediately because I know for sure that I\u2019ve already been accepted into the LLM + Robotics summer school \u2014 even though it is designed only  for PhD students, the professor has personally confirmed my admission.\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m not sure about Athens, as I would still need to go through the application process and be selected.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve become very interested in the use of NLP in robotics \u2014 it feels like a rare, emerging field with great potential and demand in the future. It could be a unique path to stand out.\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m afraid it might lean too heavily toward robotics and less on core NLP, and I worry I might not enjoy it. Also, while networking might be easier in the robotics summer school due to the smaller group, it would be more limited to just a few experts.\n\nWhat would you do in my position?\nWhat would you recommend?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1l3yocn/urgent_advice/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan to provide Ukraine with US$3bn loan from frozen Russian assets", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/06/5/7515776/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rare Viking Age Woman\u2019s Burial Discovered in Northern Norway: Laid to Rest with Her Dog", "summary": "", "link": "https://ancientist.com/2025/06/05/rare-viking-age-womans-burial-discovered-in-northern-norway-laid-to-rest-with-her-dog/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "California's Yurok Tribe gets back ancestral lands that were taken over 120 years ago", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/yurok-tribe-land-back-salmon-restoration-california-57632c4170995a0067eb89dbeb080f80", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Kyrgyz Bilateral Investment Treaty comes into force, replaces agreement of 2000", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/india-kyrgyz-bilateral-investment-treaty-comes-into-force-replaces-agreement-of-2000/article69661056.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh drops the title of \u2018Father of the Nation\u2019 for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladesh-drops-the-title-of-father-of-the-nation-for-sheikh-mujibur-rahman/article69656870.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Storing Chat History on External Database", "summary": "Is there a way to store chat history from Open WebUI in an external database like AWS RDS, Aurora, or DynamoDB instead of the default local SQLite?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1l3we8r/storing_chat_history_on_external_database/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\ude80 Pluto - Command To Fix File Names Written In Golang.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/AlexTheGreat600/pluto", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In 1932, 13-year-old Pavlik Morozov became a martyr in Soviet Propaganda after his family allegedly killed him for snitching on his father. After the USSR's fall, the story of Morozov's martyrdom was disproven, and people who actually knew him described him as a \"shithead\".", "summary": "TL:DR version\n\nHere's the story that was reported in the Soviet press at the time. Pavlik Morozov was a leader of his school's Young Pioneers group (Young Pioneers were basically the Soviet equivalent of the Hitler Youth). At the age of 13 Pavlik reported his father to the GPU (secret police). His father's supposed crime was frequently adjusted to fit whatever narrative the Soviet state wanted to push. His father was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor but that sentenced was later changed to death. Pavlik's snitching angered his family and on September 3, 1932 Pavlik and his younger brother were murdered by his uncle, grandfather, grandmother, and a cousin. All of his \"murderers\" were rounded up by the authorities and executed by firing squad. Pavlik was turned into a hero by Soviet propaganda and his story was used to encourage Eastern bloc children to snitch on their parents.\n\nHowever after the fall of the Soviet Union, Morozov's story was revisited and a very different picture emerged. For starters Pavlik was not a young pioneer and his father was actually chairman of the local soviet (not a kulak like Soviet propaganda had claimed).\n\nAs for why Pavlik informed on his father it's believed he was instigated by his mother. Pavlik's father had left the family and was living with his mistress. Pavlik's mother thought that the authorities would question her husband but let him go and he would be so scared he would leave his mistress and come back home. But that plan backfired when the Soviet authorities started instructing Pavlik to incriminate his father in court.\n\nThe evidence of Pavlik's family being involved in the murder is sketchy and it's now theorized that Pavlik was killed by some local teenagers because of a dispute over a gun. Pavlik's former neighbors mostly state that the right people were arrested for his murder. But they may be slightly biased as they don't want any blame directed at them or members of their families. One thing they all agree about is that the version of Pavlik created by Soviet  Propaganda couldn't have been more different from the real Pavlik who they described as a \"shithead\", who \"did nothing but cause trouble\".", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlik_Morozov", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel providing guns to Gaza jihadist gang to bolster opposition to Hamas", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-providing-guns-to-gaza-jihadist-gang-to-bolster-opposition-to-hamas/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How did you learn prompt engineering", "summary": "From beginners because i getting very very generic response that even i dont like", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1l43qqu/how_did_you_learn_prompt_engineering/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Chat history often failing to load", "summary": "Hey, I was wondering if anybody also has this very specific issue on the latest stable build of OpenWebUI.  \nif I try to load a conversation that's either very long or has multiple images, the UI will either take minutes to load something or just won't load anything at all.  \nAt first I thought it was a reverse proxy issue but it doesn't seem to be a network issue but a frontend one?  \nIf it can help, I'm using postgres as the database, would that explain the high latency?\n\n  \nAlso, I've seen that multiple issues &amp; discussions related to this were opened on the github, I'm wondering if anyone got a similar issue &amp; managed to fix it?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1l3um4y/chat_history_often_failing_to_load/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The idea of technological singularity raises profound questions about humanity's future.
