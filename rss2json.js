I'm using hand-coded algorithms, not neural networks, etc., and as far as I know the jury is out on whether those newer approaches will even work for a language like ancient Greek, which is highly inflected, has extremely flexible word order, and has only a fairly small corpus available (at least for the classical language). Latin is probably similar. Others have worked on these languages, and there's a pretty nice selection of open-source tools for Latin, but when I investigated the possibilities for Greek they were all problematic in one way or another, hence my decision to roll my own.\n\nI would like to make a common API that could be used for both Latin and Greek, providing interfaces to other people's code on the Latin side. I've gotten a basic version of Latin analysis working by writing an interface to software called [Whitaker's Words]( but I have not yet crafted a consistent API that fits them both.\n\nHave any folks here worked with such systems in the past and formed opinions about what works well in such an API? Other systems I'm aware of include CLTK, Morpheus, and Collatinus for Latin and Greek, and NLTK for other languages.\n\nThere are a lot of things involved in tokenization that are hard to get right, and one thing I'm not sure about is how best to fit that into the API. I'm currently leaning toward having the API require its input to be tokenized in the format I'm using, but providing convenience functions for doing that.\n\nThe state of the art for Latin and Greek seems to be that nobody has ever successfully used context to improve the results. It's pretty common for an isolated word to have three or four possible part of speech analyses. If there are going to be future machine learning models that might be able to do better, then it would be nice if the API gave a convenient method for providing enough context. For now, I'm just using context to help determine whether a word is a capitalized proper noun.\n\nThanks in advance for any comments or suggestions. If there's an API that you've worked with and liked or disliked, that would be great to hear about. If there's an API for this purpose that is widely used and well designed, I could just implement that.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1dnruy3/designing_an_api_for_lemmatization_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Long March to Monoculturalism: The Radicalisation of the British Right", "summary": "", "link": "https://thebattleground.eu/podcast/the-long-march-to-monoculturalism/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At least 30 dead as torrential rains lash Central America", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-30-dead-torrential-rains-lash-central-america-2024-06-21/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83c\udf33 Deforestation in the Amazon reaches lowest level since 2018", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.warpnews.org/human-progress/deforestation-in-the-amazon-reaches-lowest-level-since-2018/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Music labels slam AI startups Suno and Udio with massive copyright lawsuit", "summary": "1/ The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and major music labels Universal, Warner, and Sony have filed a lawsuit against AI music companies Suno and Udio for alleged copyright infringement.\r\n\r\n2/ The labels accuse Suno and Udio of illegally copying recordings to train their AI models, generating music that competes directly with the original sound recordings. They seek an injunction and damages for the alleged infringements.\r\n\r\n3/ This case is similar to other lawsuits against AI companies, with the central issue being whether AI training on copyrighted material falls under \"fair use\" or constitutes infringement.
