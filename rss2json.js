So when user asks any question related to a specific product thorough RAG I can identify correct product and from metadata I can access all the content. Here I know, I can stick with conditional logic as well for getting metadata, but I am trying with RAG thinking I may use additional information in the embedding extraction.\n\nNow my question is for Data Source - 3 and 4, for some specific questions, I need detailed document information. Since I can't send this every time due to context and token usage limitations, I am looking for creating RAG for these documents, but I am not sure how scalable that is. because if I want to maintain 1000 different products, then I need 2000 separate vector databases.\n\nIs my thought process correct, or is there any better alternative.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1n5rk4r/need_advice_on_setting_up_rag_with_multimodal/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - pompelmi/pompelmi: free, open-source file scanner", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/pompelmi/pompelmi", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Southern Lunar Standstill at Recumbent Stone Circle", "summary": "Over the past few months I've been exploring the potential links between the recumbent stone circles of North East Scotland and lunar alignments.

The south was held by the Kingdom of Italy, now aligned with the Allied powers. The north became the Italian Social Republic, a Nazi puppet state still ruled by Benito Mussolini and his fascists. Amid this division, the city of Naples was occupied by Nazi German forces led by Colonel Walter Scholl. The occupation was especially brutal, as Scholl ordered that up to 100 Neapolitans should be executed for every German killed.\n\n\n\nWith tensions rising, on September 27, 1943, the Germans received rumors (later proven to be false) that the Allied forces would be landing at Naples imminently and decided to evacuate the city. Before leaving, they received orders from Hitler to deport the population and destroy the city so it couldn't be used as an Allied stronghold.\n\n\n\nAt this point, the Neapolitans, fed up with the German occupation, indiscriminate killings, and ongoing wartime conditions, revolted. With no central planning or organization, they rose up, raiding armories, freeing prisoners, and sabotaging the German plans. They continued this resistance until Allied troops arrived on the morning of October 1st.\n\n\n\nSource: [\n\n\n\nPhoto Source: [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5vwon", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Women sexually harassed during protests for safer streets", "summary": "", "link": "https://nltimes.nl/2025/09/01/women-sexually-harassed-protests-safer-streets", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hi!
