While most attempts are foiled, those who do make it across then often head onwards to Germany.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Polish border guard revealed that, as part of an investigation being overseen by the military affairs department of the Warsaw district prosecutor\u2019s office, they searched the residence of an unnamed Polish woman who had been involved in providing aid to migrants at the border.\n\nThey discovered 62 temporary foreigner identity certificates, which are issued to people who have applied for asylum in Poland, entitling them to remain in the country while their claim is processed.\n\nWhile their applications are considered, asylum seekers are not allowed to leave the country. However, the border guard notes that, among the 62 individuals who received those certificates, most had their asylum proceedings discontinued because they had left Poland.\n\nNow, the woman in whose home the documents were found has been charged with helping at least 15 foreigners illegally cross the border from Poland to Germany, a crime punishable by between six months and eight years in prison.
