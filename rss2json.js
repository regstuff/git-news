Licensed under GPL 3.0, OpenHTTP can quickly handle requests, fetch resources, and respond with four built-in response codes (404, 500, 200, and 206). Along with this, OpenHTTP has a basic Python Tkinter GUI, and its own file format I wrote for configuration called camfig, and albeit basic, it's fast, easy, and gets the job done.\n\nFor the future, I plan on adding custom POST compatibility, where users can compile their own programs for the server using the OpenHTTP Post Handler library based on a template, which is planned to be released in OpenHTTP-v0.4.0-release.\n\n  \nPlease report any issues on GitHub's issues thread, and give me advice in the replies. Together, we can make the fastest and most reliable open source web server of 2025.
