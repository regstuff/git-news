It was the fifth year that the march was held \u2013 the only other annual Pride gathering in the country besides that of Budapest \u2013 and was becoming a showcase of the city\u2019s commitment to freedom, diversity and the coexistence of minorities.\n\nThis year, however, politics loomed large. In March the country\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and his rightwing populist party [had voted to ban]( Pride events and allow the authorities to use facial recognition technology to identify and potentially fine those in attendance, a move Amnesty International described as a \u201cfull-frontal attack\u201d on LGBTQ+ people.\n\nEven so, in June tens of thousands of people [defied the ban]( to march in Budapest after Pride was rebranded as a municipal cultural event.\n\nMonths later, P\u00e9cs Pride [also attracted record numbers]( with as many as 8,000 people, including several members of the European parliament, taking part despite the police and the country\u2019s highest court confirming that the event was banned.\n\nFor the organiser G\u00e9za Buz\u00e1s-H\u00e1bel the nightmare began soon after. \u201cWe decided to hold P\u00e9cs Pride, despite the ban, because Hungary must remain a European country,\u201d the Romani LGBTQ+ activist said. \u201cFreedom of assembly is a fundamental human right, and we cannot allow political decisions to limit our community\u2019s visibility or self-expression.\u201d\n\n...\n\nBuz\u00e1s-H\u00e1bel said it was part of a much wider process playing out across Hungary. \u201cThis is not really about me. In the eyes of those in power, I am just a speck of dust,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is directed at my broader community, and the goal is to intimidate the people around me. They are using me as a tool to set an example for the entire country.\u201d\n\nHe spoke to the Guardian before a trip to Brussels, where, as a board member for Europe\u2019s largest Roma youth network, he was set to take part in a ceremony recognising Roma youth-led projects. The visit would also afford him the chance to meet with EU decision-makers and politicians interested in his case and the situation in Hungary, he said.\n\n\u201cThe real question is whether the European Union is ready to stand up for the principles it claims to represent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, in an EU member state, someone can face criminal prosecution simply for organising a peaceful Pride march \u2013 and the EU does not respond firmly \u2013 it sends the message that European values only matter until defending them requires real political courage.\u201d\n\nDespite the uncertainty that now plagued his life and career, he said he had no regrets. \u201cI have already experienced the personal cost of this system: I lost all my jobs, I was placed under secret service surveillance, and I now face potential criminal charges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut none of this changes the fact that I would organise Pride again in exactly the same way \u2013 and I will do so next year as well,\u201d he added. \u201cFor me, it is not just an event, but a stand for all those who need visibility and courage in such a hostile environment.
