He insists that he supports continued membership of the bloc.\n\nIn a lecture at\u00a0Charles University in Prague, Nawrocki said the Poles and the Czechs know well from their history the dangers of being treated as \u201cstudents of European integration\u201d by \u201cmore experienced\u201d Western countries, rather than as partners or leaders in such change.\n\nToday, once again, \u201ccertain Western partners try to guide us in the one and only right direction\u201d, warned the Polish president.\n\nHe argued that the EU which Poland joined 21 years ago \u2013 one that would provide economic opportunities and freedom of movement \u2013 has turned into one that is trying to \u201cdictate the terms of our political system, our diet, or the upbringing of our children\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there are \u201ccertain forces at play that aim at creating a more centralised European Union\u2026\\[that\\] deprives member states, excluding \\[the\\] two largest \\[Germany and France\\], of their sovereignty\u2026\\[by\\] establishing the superiority of EU institutions over the sovereignty of member states\u201d.\n\nNawrocki said that Poland, and in particular the conservative camp to which he belongs, opposes those trends. He emphasised, however, that this does not make them \u201can enemy of the EU\u201d.\n\n\u201cPoland \u2013 like every member state \u2013 has its own vision of the EU and is entitled to it,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt has the right to strive for the manifestation and adoption of that vision. This is the nature of democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Polish president then outlined his vision of a \u201cPolish programme for the European Union\u201d that would ensure that national member states are \u201cmasters of the \\[EU\\] treaties and the sovereigns deciding on the shape of European integration\u201d, as they are \u201cthe only functioning European democracies\u201d.\n\nNawrocki called for the principle of unanimity to remain in all areas of EU decision-making where it currently applies. That means, in effect, that a single member state can veto change in those areas.\n\nHe also advocated for the EU to maintain the principle that each member state, even the very smallest, has the right to designate a member of the European Commission.\n\nMore controversially, Nawrocki called for the introduction of a prohibition on people being appointed to the highest EU positions without the recommendation of their home country\u2019s government.\n\nIn 2017, Donald Tusk was reappointed as president of the European Council against the opposition of the Polish government, which was led by the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. Nawrocki is aligned with PiS and, like them, is an opponent of Tusk, who is now Poland\u2019s prime minister.\n\nIndeed, in his new proposal, Nawrocki called for the complete abolition of the position of president of the European Council, saying that the role should be carried out by the head of the executive branch of government of whichever member state holds\u00a0[the EU\u2019s rotating presidency](\n\nThis would ensure that the job is done by \u201ca politician with a democratic mandate and political base, rather than a bureaucrat-official dependent on the support of the EU\u2019s greatest powers\u201d.\n\nRotating the position every six months would also prevent the \u201cpermanent dominance of the EU\u2019s \u2018central powers\u2019 and the marginalisation of others\u201d. Likewise, Nawrocki called for the council\u2019s voting system \u201cto eliminate the excessive advantage of large EU countries\u201d.\n\nThe Polish president also proposed that the EU\u2019s competences should be limited to \u201cselected non-ideological areas\u201d, such as economic development and preventing demographic collapse.\n\n\u201cThis means abandoning excessive ambitions to regulate the entire lives of member states and its citizens and the intention of shaping all aspects of politics, sometimes by bypassing or violating the will of the citizens,\u201d said Nawrocki, who also called for the EU not to seek to \u201ccompete with NATO\u201d on security.\n\n\u201cLet me be crystal clear: I am a supporter of Poland in the European Union,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut I believe that issues such as political and justice systems or security are reserved exclusively for the Polish constitution, the Polish president and the Polish government. Just as they should be for every member state.\u201d\n\nWhen PiS was in office between 2015 and 2023, it regularly clashed with Brussels, in particular over its\u00a0[judicial reforms]( The EU accused PiS of threatening the rule of law. Many elements of PiS\u2019s reforms were found by European courts to violate EU law.\n\nPiS argued that the European Commission was overstepping its authority in taking action against Poland, and claimed that it was doing so for political reasons, because it was opposed to right-wing governments that sought to protect national sovereignty.\n\nPoland\u2019s current main ruling party, the centrist, pro-EU Civic Coalition (KO), has regularly accused PiS of pushing Poland towards \u201cPolexit\u201d from the EU, either deliberately or in effect.\n\nLast week, foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski levelled the same accusation against Nawrocki, claiming that his recent\u00a0[speech on Polish Independence Day](\u00a0was intended to \u201cprepare the psychological and political groundwork for leaving the EU, for Polexit\u201d.\n\nIn response to Nawrocki\u2019s speech in Prague, Sikorski issued a brief comment saying that the government \u201chas not authorised the president to submit proposals for amending the European treaties\u201d.\n\nLikewise, interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski stated that, \u201cthe president, by putting forward controversial proposals for changes to the principles of the \\[EU\u2019s\\] functioning, cannot claim to be speaking on behalf of Poland because it is the government that conducts foreign policy\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/25/polands-president-proposes-eu-reform-to-stop-brussels-dictating-terms-to-member-states/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The End of the Longest Peace?", "summary": "# One of History\u2019s Greatest Achievements Is Under Threat\n\nThe past eight decades have been the longest period without a war between great powers since the Roman Empire. This anomalous era of extended peace came after two catastrophic wars, each of which was so much more destructive than prior conflicts that historians found it necessary to create an entirely new category to describe them: world wars.\n\nThe absence of great-power wars since 1945 did not happen by accident. The experience of catastrophic war also compelled the architects of the postwar order to attempt to bend the arc of history. American leaders\u2019 personal experiences of winning the war gave them the confidence to think the unthinkable and to do what previous generations had dismissed as undoable by constructing an international order that could bring peace.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, world leaders expected countries to build nuclear weapons as they acquired the technical capability to do so. Kennedy predicted that there would be 25 to 30 nuclear-armed states by the 1970s, which led him to promote one of the boldest initiatives of American foreign policy. Today, 185 states have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty forswearing nuclear weapons. Remarkably, only nine countries have nuclear arsenals. More than 100 countries now have the economic and technical base to build nuclear weapons. Their choice to rely on the security guarantees of others is geostrategically and historically unnatural.\n\nIn 1987, the historian John Lewis Gaddis published a landmark essay titled \u201cThe Long Peace.\u201d arguing that the foundation of this modern long peace was the Cold War. In structural conditions that would in earlier eras almost certainly have led to a third world war, the United States and the Soviet Union confronted each other with arsenals sufficient to withstand a nuclear strike and retaliate decisively. \n\nIn addition to the establishment of the United Nations, the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the multilateral arrangements that eventually developed into the European Union, and the fierce ideological dimension of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry, the central causal factor for peace, Gaddis argued, was the mutual judgment that systemic interests trumped ideological ones. Their desire to prevent mutual destruction was more important.\n\nThe United States launched the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe, established the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to promote global development, and pushed for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to set the rules of economic exchange to promote economic growth. The United States even abandoned its prior strategy of trying to avoid entangling alliances.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, in the early 1990s, triumphalists hailed a new unipolar era in which only the United States remained as a great power. This new order would bring a peace dividend in which countries could flourish without worrying about great-power conflict.\n\nAmong the factors that history shows contribute to the violent end of a major geopolitical cycle, five stand out that could bring the ongoing long peace to a close.\n\n1. At the top of the list is amnesia. Successive generations of American adults, including every serving military officer, have no personal memory of the horrible costs of a great-power war.\n2. The existence of rising competitors also threatens peace. China\u2019s meteoric ascent is challenging U.S. preeminence, echoing the type of fierce rivalry between an established and a rising power that the ancient Greek historian Thucydides warned would lead to conflict.\n3. Global economic leveling further increases the possibility of war. American economic predominance has eroded as other countries have recovered from the devastation of the two world wars. \n4. When an established power also overextends itself militarily\u2014which the US arguably has done\u2014its ability to deter or defend against rising powers weakens.\n5. Finally, the tendency of an established power to descend into bitter political divisions at home paralyzes its ability to act coherently on the world stage. This is unfolding today: an ostensibly well-meaning administration in Washington is upending nearly every existing international relationship, institution, and process to impose its view of how the international order must change.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read the rest of the article here]( in case the original page is inaccessible.", "link": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/end-longest-peace", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hamas attack victims sue Binance for allegedly allowing payments to militant group", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/hamas-attack-victims-sue-binance-allegedly-allowing-payments-militant-group-2025-11-24", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
