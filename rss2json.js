The data I\u2019m working with is extremely sensitive and can\u2019t leave my system, so everything\u2014LLM, embeddings\u2014needs to stay local. No exposure to closed-source companies is allowed.\n\nI initially tested with a sample dataset (not sensitive) using Gemini for the LLM and embedding, which worked great and set my benchmark. However, when I switched to a fully local setup using Ollama\u2019s Llama 3.1:8b model and sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, I ran into two big issues:\n\n1. The documents extracted aren\u2019t as relevant as the initial setup (I\u2019ve printed the extracted docs for multiple queries across both apps). I need the local app to match that level of relevance.\n\n2. Inference is painfully slow (\\\\\\~5 min per query). My system has 16GB RAM and a GTX 1650Ti with 4GB VRAM. Any ideas to improve speed?\n\nI would appreciate suggestions from those who have worked on similar local RAG setups!
