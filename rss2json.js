I am looking at going back to school do a Masters in Computational Linguistics and need some opinions on what programs to look at in Canada and the US. For reference, I have a BA in Linguistics, and I am aware that I will have to take catch up classes in stats/computer programming/etc. \n \nThe main deciding factor other than quality of the program is location. I live in Toronto, Canada, and I would rather not have to relocate unless I absolutely have to (because of family/partner). If absolutely necessary, I would be amenable to relocating within Canada, but I\u2019d rather not move to the US at this point in time. Therefore, I am also focusing my search on programs that are offered online.\n\nHere are some programs I\u2019ve looked at (with pros and cons):  \n- **University of British Columbia - Master of Data Science in CL**: looks very data science heavy, and I\u2019d have to relocate to Vancouver (although only for 10 months). \n- **University of Toronto**: doesn\u2019t have a formal CL Masters program but it seems like you can specialize in it through a MA in Linguistics. Pro is that it\u2019s in Toronto! \n- **University of Washington - MSc in CL**: this program really caught my eye, and it\u2019s offered online! At the end of the program a lot of students opt to do an internship which often really helps with securing a job post graduation. They also seem to have a good set up for students with a linguistics background to get up to speed. \n- Any other online programs in the US? Have I missed any programs in Canada? \n\nThank you all in advance!! \n\n**Note**: I\u2019m *veryyy* lucky and the cost of tuition (Canada vs. US) wouldn\u2019t be a main deciding factor in choosing a program. \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1or84mc/masters_in_computational_linguistics_canada_vs_us/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Building PolyMCP: Making LLM Agents Truly Multi-Tool", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/llm-use/Polymcp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Peru congress declares Mexican president 'persona non grata'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly9x8vv9v9o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ancient Murals in Peru Reminded Residents of Climate Crisis", "summary": "", "link": "https://archaeology.org/news/2025/11/06/ancient-murals-in-peru-reminded-residents-of-climate-crisis/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The best tools I\u2019ve found for evaluating AI voice agents", "summary": "I\u2019ve been working on a voice agent project recently and quickly realized that building the pipeline (STT \u2192 LLM \u2192 TTS) is the easy part.

It's an open-source AI assistant for Android called Panda. The way it works is pretty neat: you can control your phone just with your voice.\n\nAnd I don't just mean \"set a timer\" or basic commands. It's smart enough to actually use your apps for you. It uses intelligent screen understanding to understand your voice in natural language and execute complex, multi-step tasks across any app.\n\nCheckout this [demo video](\n\nLike, you can literally just watch it:  \n- Open Netflix and play Breaking Bad with just one voice command.\n- Find a video on TikTok about how to tie a tie. Panda will navigate the interface, search the content, and perform the whole operation for you.\n- Open Amazon and search for \"USB 3 cable 3 feet long\", handling the e-commerce site to find exactly what you need.\n\nAnd it will open the app, tap the buttons, and do the whole thing. He's been really focused on making it super fast, too.\n\n### Why I'm sharing this\n\nHonestly, I just think it's a cool project. One of the ideas he has for it is helping with accessibility, which I think is awesome. It could be super helpful for anyone who has a hard time with touch screens. \n\nPlus, I am using this while I'm cooking or my hands are messy and I want to change a song or reply to a text or in the morning when I was eating breakfast and running late. I just said, \"Hey Panda, can you book an Uber from location A to location B?\" and it just handled it. Pretty interesting, right?\n\nHe's gotten some love from a few tech blogs and YouTubers, so I figured you all might like to see it, too.\n\n### Give it a try &amp; contribute\n\nThe project is fully open sourced.

I remember sentiment analysis was one of the most popular tasks, the first example you'd come up with when people asked what NLP was even good for.\n\nOf course transformers already existed and they were the state-of-the-art in NLP, but anyway that was before ChatGPT came out in November 2022, which has revolutionized the field. What was previously achieved via a variety of computational methods, can now be easily accomplished plugging it in into any LLM.\n\nThat both rendered my knowledge rather useless, but at the same time generative AI (spearheaded by text-to-text aka NLP) became the hot topic your 70-yo completely offline uncle would talk about in family dinners.\n\nSo, two years after finishing my master's I got hired by a company that was specifically interested in my NLP background.\n\nFor privacy reasons I won't disclose much, but the project we've developed scraping Internet data and comparing different products/topics seems to be on a dead-end street. Scores seem to be all over the place and summaries, well, they're informative but at the end of the day, it's just aggregating already public data.\n\nReading through articles on limitations of sentiment analysis, most of them point out stuff that to me is either overcome as of now or a minor problem: sarcasm, negations, ambiguity, etc. Frankly, sentiment analysis itself is essentially a solved task, LLMs can handle it perfectly fine. It's just that Internet data is too messy and noisy for us to extract any value. How can you extract any robust score from that?\n\nOf course I should be self-critical and change our approach, but I also find it hard to know why someone would be interested in purchasing our services even if good, when they might as well take some time to skim through public data and draw their own conclusions.\n\nSo my question is, what ideas are being implemented and bringing robust scores, and real value?
