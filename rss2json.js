For ten years, companies may not build advanced technology facilities in China, use stimulus funds for investments in China, or export new technologies to China.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1fiy95h/us_chips_away_at_foreign_dependencies_with_3/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Oil giant builds world's largest AI inference center in Saudi Arabia with US chipmaker Groq", "summary": "1/ California-based AI chip company Groq plans to build a major data center in Saudi Arabia in partnership with Saudi Arabian oil company Aramco. The facility will initially house 19,000 language processing units (LPUs) and could be expanded to 200,000 LPUs.\r\n\r\n2/ Groq has focused on developing specialized hardware for AI applications. The company's LPUs are optimized to run language models at high speeds. According to Groq, the planned data center will be the largest AI inference center in the world.\r\n\r\n3/ The partnership is part of Saudi Arabia's efforts to establish itself as a technology hub and diversify its economy. Groq benefits from low energy costs and available land in Saudi Arabia, as well as access to four billion people with 100 millisecond latency.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1fiy0jk/oil_giant_builds_worlds_largest_ai_inference/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenAI boosts usage limits for o1 AI model", "summary": "1/ OpenAI has increased the usage limits for its o1 AI model.\r\n\r\n2/ For Plus and Team users, the limit for o1-mini has been increased from 50 messages per week to 50 messages per day.\r\n\r\n3/ For o1-preview, the limit has been increased from 30 to 50 messages per week.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1fixvxl/openai_boosts_usage_limits_for_o1_ai_model/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Google's DataGemma aims to ground language models in reality and curb AI hallucinations", "summary": "1/ Google has introduced DataGemma, a set of open models for improving the accuracy of language models by anchoring them in real-world data from the Data Commons knowledge graph.\r\n\r\n2/ DataGemma uses two approaches: Retrieval Interleaved Generation (RIG) checks statistics against the Data Commons, while Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves relevant information and incorporates it into response generation.\r\n\r\n3/ Both have advantages and disadvantages: RIG works effectively in all contexts, but cannot learn new data.
