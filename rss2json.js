However, were Putin to visit Hungary, it is possible he would have to fly over other EU countries that remain committed to the international court.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Radio Rodzina on Tuesday morning, Sikorski was asked what Poland would do if Putin were to seek to fly through its airspace.\n\n\u201cWe cannot guarantee that an independent Polish court will not order a hypothetical plane carrying Putin to be brought down for the suspect\u2019s transfer to The Hague,\u201d said Sikorski, referring to the Dutch city where the ICC is based.\n\nThe Polish foreign minister also criticised Hungary, saying that \u201cthe fact that an EU member state, still bound by the International Criminal Court, invites President Putin is not only distasteful, it also shows that Hungary positions itself not as part of the West\u201d.\n\nHe added that Hungary was also undermining Western unity in other ways, such as by blocking assistance for Ukraine and maintaining high imports of Russian oil. Poland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s most vocal allies since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\n\n\nSikorski\u2019s remarks prompted an angry response from Lavrov, who noted that last week a Polish court had refused to extradite a Ukrainian man suspected of involvement in blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines that brought Russian gas to Germany.\n\n\u201cI heard here that Mr Sikorski threatened that the security of President Putin\u2019s plane\u2026in Polish airspace,\u201d said Lavrov, quoted by news agency TASS, adding that it appears that \u201cthe Poles are now ready to commit terrorist acts themselves\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn Poland, a court officially made a decision justifying the terrorist attack on Nord Stream \u2013 and now the foreign minister is saying that, if a Polish court demands it, it will impede the free movement of the Russian leader\u2019s plane,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nBulgaria, another EU member, yesterday indicated that it would be ready to open its airspace for Putin\u2019s aircraft.\n\n\u201cWhen efforts are made for peace, it is only logical that all sides contribute to making such a meeting possible,\u201d said Bulgaria\u2019s foreign minister, Georg Georgiev, according to Bulgarian news service Novinite.\n\nIn theory, Putin could also reach Hungary without crossing another EU country by flying from the Adriatic Sea over Montenegro and Serbia.\n\nMoscow has not said whether Putin will even attend the proposed summit, or how he would travel if he did. CNN reported on Tuesday that the event may be delayed, citing sources who said a preparatory meeting between the leaders\u2019 top foreign policy aides this week had been postponed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sikorski\u2019s remarks also faced criticism from S\u0142awomir Mentzen, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) group that sits in Poland\u2019s parliament.\n\nMentzen said that threatening to \u201cintercept a plane carrying the president of a nuclear superpower to peace talks\u2026seems quite risky and may have completely unpredictable consequences\u201d.\n\nHe then noted that, when there was talk of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who is also wanted on an ICC warrant \u2013 visiting Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Polish government said that it would\u00a0[guarantee him safe passage](\n\n\u201cWhy does Poland completely ignore the ICC in one case, but in another wants to obey the ICC, even risking retaliation from Russia?\u201d asked Mentzen, who\u00a0[finished a strong third in this year\u2019s presidential election](\u00a0and whose party is currently riding high in the polls.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/10/21/poland-cannot-guarantee-putin-would-not-be-arrested-if-he-flies-through-polish-airspace-to-hungary/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How Stalin\u2019s horrible binge-drinking parties became party politics", "summary": "After the Second World War, as the Iron Man\u2019s health began to decline, Stalin withdrew from Moscow and became increasingly reclusive. His dacha soon turned into the de facto center of power. Decision-making took a boozy turn as Stalin began ruling through dinner invitations. Most evenings of the week, he would summon his closest collaborators for what he called \u201cinformal\u201d dinners.\n\nThis was a very tight circle: Lavrenti Beria, Stalin\u2019s ruthless enforcer; Nikita Khrushchev, his future successor; Georgy Malenkov, the chief negotiator; and Vyacheslav Molotov, who developed a reputation for heavy drinking after repeatedly trying to outdrink the boss. Declining Stalin\u2019s invitation was unthinkable\u2014and refusing to drink was even worse. Over time, most of his dinner companions developed serious health problems brought on by alcoholism.\n\nThese gatherings gradually morphed into an extension of politics itself. Dinners stretched into late-night parties, and parties often devolved into disasters. While Stalin clearly enjoyed himself, his guests dreaded the ordeal. This was no cheerful evening at an eccentric uncle\u2019s house.
