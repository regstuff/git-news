This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration, which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g. discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting and previously impossible opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries that cannot be predicted ahead of time. We evaluate IGE on a range of language-based tasks that require search and exploration. In Game of 24, a multistep mathematical reasoning problem, IGE reaches 100% success rate 70.8% faster than the best classic graph search baseline. Next, in BabyAI-Text, a challenging partially observable gridworld, IGE exceeds the previous SOTA with orders of magnitude fewer online samples. Finally, in TextWorld, we show the unique ability of IGE to succeed in settings requiring long-horizon exploration where prior SOTA FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, IGE combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1d8iza2/intelligent_goexplore_standing_on_the_shoulders/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Remote tribe gets hooked on internet porn", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/04/hooked-porn-remote-brazilian-tribe-internet-musk/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ruling Social Democrats overtake far-right AfD in German Poll", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.luxtimes.lu/europeanunion/ruling-social-democrats-overtake-far-right-afd-in-german-poll/13574288.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A blue painted shrine is the latest discovery in Pompeii \u2018treasure chest\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/04/science/blue-sacrarium-pompeii-excavation-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iranian General among those killed in air strike in Syria", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/06/04/iranian-general-killed-israeli-air-strike-aleppo-syria/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Question on using NLP technique for semantic search and answer generation", "summary": "So I have a task where I a cosmetic product\u2019s description and the ingredients it contains. I should be extraction whether the product has fragrance or not.\n\nThe steps I have used so far,\n1. I tried keyword search where I searched for keywords like \u201cfragrance, parfum, scent\u201d because these three keywords are present some times in the ingredients but many other times words like \u201codor or citric smell\u201d is used and also other times \u201cless than one percent fragrance, fragrant-free\u201d keywords are present signifying that the product does not have fragrance - keyword search wasn\u2019t possible much as I couldn\u2019t (or didn\u2019t know) to handle negation clearly.\n\n2. Used a LLM to just give in the description and ask model if it has fragrance or not, used txtai library but models like BART is very slow and Flan-t5 is not very accurate.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what else I should use or proceed I cannot fine tune a text classification model as I have only 50 to 100 rows of data, I don\u2019t want to do manually cause in future the code would be more useful if we decide to scale the project.\n\nAny ideas of approach or correction will be very much appreciated.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1d8ercp/question_on_using_nlp_technique_for_semantic/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Celtic Elites Passed Political Power Matrilineally, DNA Analysis Reveals", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1d8is9a/celtic_elites_passed_political_power/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany considers Afghan deportations after police stabbing \u2013 DW \u2013 06/04/2024", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/germany-considers-afghan-deportations-after-police-stabbing/a-69268100", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Question about satellite scan/image", "summary": "Is it possible to use satellite to scan an area to see metals underground?
