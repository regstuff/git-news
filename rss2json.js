However, even ahead of today\u2019s decision, the justice minister had already proposed a new bill reforming the KRS intended to take into account Duda\u2019s concerns.\n\nThe KRS is the body responsible for nominating judges. In 2017, the then PiS government changed how the council\u2019s 25 members were selected. Previously, most were chosen by judges themselves. However, after PiS\u2019s reforms, most were selected by politicians.\n\nThe move was widely condemned by expert bodies as undermining judicial independence. Various\u00a0[Polish\u00a0](\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings have found the KRS to no longer be a legitimate body due to its lack of independence.\n\nThat in turn has called into question the status of around 2,500 judges who have been appointed through the KRS since it was overhauled by PiS, and the huge number of rulings issued by them.\n\nFor example, around 60% of Supreme Court judges, including its chief justice, were nominated by the so-called \u201cneo-KRS\u201d.\n\nWhen PiS lost power in December 2023, the new government \u2013 a broad coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk \u2013 pledged to restore the rule of law, including\u00a0[depoliticising the KRS](\n\nA bill to that effect was approved by\u00a0[parliament in April 2024]( However, in August of that year, Duda refused to sign it into law, instead referring it to the TK for assessment. He argued that the bill was unconstitutional because it ended the current KRS\u2019s term prematurely.\n\nOn Thursday, the court agreed with Duda, ruling that the fixed terms of office for KRS members are essential to the body\u2019s functioning and cannot be cut short through legislation.\n\nThe TK judge who delivered the justification for the ruling, Krystyna Paw\u0142owicz, who was a PiS MP until being appointed to the court, noted that not only does their decision mean the bill has been rejected, but that lawmakers must avoid trying to reintroduce provisions the TK has found unconstitutional.\n\nFailure to comply with this could lead to criminal proceedings, said Paw\u0142owicz, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nEven before today\u2019s ruling, justice minister Waldemar \u017burek had already\u00a0[put forward a fresh draft bill](\u00a0intended as a \u201ccompromise\u201d that would take account of Duda\u2019s concerns. \u017burek\u2019s proposal would still ensure that KRS members are mostly chosen by the judiciary, but would not cut short the current council\u2019s term.\n\n\u017burek\u2019s bill still needs the approval of the cabinet and parliament. But even if, as seems likely, it obtains those, it appears unlikely that President Karol Nawrocki \u2013 who replaced Duda in August and is also aligned with PiS \u2013 would sign it.\n\nEarlier this week, Nawrocki\u2019s chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, condemned the \u201cterror of lawlessness \\[being\\] perpetrated by Minister \u017burek at the behest of Donald Tusk\u201d.\n\nHe told broadcaster RMF that the president would, by January at the latest, present his own plan to \u201crestore normality in the justice system\u2026instead of the terror and chaos that currently exists\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*, Bogucki said that Nawrocki\u2019s plan would include a presidential bill to overhaul the KRS that would still see most of its members chosen by parliament but would change the procedure in ways intended to offer a compromise.\n\nAccording to the newspaper\u2019s sources, if Nawrocki\u2019s proposals are rejected by the ruling coalition, the president would seek to call a national referendum to settle the issue. Nawrocki himself publicly suggested that idea earlier this month.\n\nMeanwhile, deputy justice minister S\u0142awomir Pa\u0142ka told the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily that, unless a solution is found soon, the rules introduced under PiS will require parliament to appoint new members of the KRS in May 2026.\n\nThat process would be controlled by Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition, which holds a parliamentary majority. \u201cThis, I suspect, is not necessarily to President Nawrocki\u2019s liking,\u201d said Pa\u0142ka.\n\nLast week, in an escalation of both the rule-of-law crisis and the conflict between the government and the president, Nawrocki announced that he was\u00a0[refusing to approve 46 judicial nominations](\u00a0because the judges in question are supportive of the unconstitutional actions of the government.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/20/constitutional-court-rejects-government-bill-overhauling-body-at-heart-of-polands-rule-of-law-crisis/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Netanyahu convenes cabinet on settler violence in the West Bank that continues unabated", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-israel-palestine-west-bank-04a9ec4d55e1e0556428ca23c70efe91", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poles\u2019 negative attitudes towards Germans rise to highest level in 25 years", "summary": "Attitudes towards Germans in Poland have significantly worsened over the last three years, the latest version of a long-running study has found.\n\nLess than a third (32%) of Poles now say they like Germans, down from 50% in 2022.

Meanwhile, negative feelings towards Poles have actually fallen over that period, from 14% to 9%.\n\nThe findings come from the\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*, a regular survey exploring topics such as bilateral relations, knowledge about the neighbouring country, and current political developments.\n\nIt is carried out in cooperation between the Institute of Public Affairs, the German-Polish Institute, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Foundation for German-Polish Cooperation.\n\nOne area of particular tension between Poland and Germany in recent years has been over World War Two history, and in particular the bid\u00a0[launched](\u00a0by Poland\u2019s former government in 2022 to obtain $1.3 trillion in reparations from Germany for its brutal occupation of 1939 to 1945.\n\nPrevious opinion polls have\u00a0[suggested](\u00a0that most Poles believe Poland deserves such compensation. But Berlin has\u00a0[maintained its longstanding position](\u00a0that the question was\u00a0[legally settled](\u00a0long ago and nothing is now owed.\u00a0\n\nThe latest\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*\u00a0shows that most Poles (58%) believe that Germany should do more to compensate Poland for the war, while only a minority of Germans (23%) think so.\n\nMeanwhile, over a third of Poles (34%) agree with the statement that \u201chistorical issues remain the main problem in Polish-German relations and without clearing them up it is not possible to talk about the present and future\u201d. Only 16% of Germans felt the same.\n\nBy contrast, 70% of Germans said that \u201cPolish-German relations should concentrate more on issues relating to the present and future than on historical issues\u201d. Only 48% of Poles agreed with that.\n\nA big difference is apparent on this issue between supporters of different political parties in Poland, especially between the right-wing opposition and the more liberal ruling coalition.\n\nOnly 8% of voters of the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which launched the reparations bid when it was in power, think Germany has done enough to account for the past. For the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), the figure is also 8%.\n\nAmong voters of the centrist Civic Coalition (KO) and The Left (Lewica), which are part of the current ruling coalition, the figures are much higher (though still a minority), at 34% and 38% respectively.\n\nAnother area of tension between Poland and Germany in recent years has been over European policies on issues such as trade, climate and migration. And here the\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*\u00a0again reflects those issues.\n\nA decade ago, a large majority of Poles, 68%, believed that \u201cGermany generally contributes to better cooperation in Europe\u201d. However, that number has consistently declined since then, reaching just 35% this year.\n\nAlmost as many Poles, 32%, now believe that Germany contributes to \u201ca worsening of disputes and tensions in Europe\u201d.\n\nGerman attitudes have gone in the opposite direction: in 2018, 53% said that Poland contributes to worsening relations in Europe; that has now fallen to 31%. However, only 33% of Germans say Poland contributes to better cooperation. The largest proportion, 37%, say that they do not know.\n\nAgain, in Poland, a political divide is visible here: only 36% of supporters of PiS, which regularly clashed with Berlin during its time in office, think relations with Germany are good. By contrast, a large majority of voters of KO (77%) and The Left (66%) see relations as positive.\n\nThe current KO-led government has brought about better relations with Germany than was the case under PiS. However, it has still clashed with Berlin on\u00a0[issues such as migration](\n\nThe survey finds that information sources correlate with attitudes. Poles who rely on social media for news about Germany tend to hold more critical views of the country. Those informed by traditional media are generally friendlier toward Germany.\n\nPersonal experience also counts: visiting the neighbouring country correlates with more positive attitudes \u2013 on both sides of the border.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/20/poles-negative-attitudes-towards-germans-rise-to-highest-level-in-25-years/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018There is so much corruption\u2019: hundreds of thousands protest in Manila over missing flood funds", "summary": "Huge rally organised by megachurch whose members vote in a bloc could spell trouble for Philippine president\n\nFrom a skyscraper in downtown Manila, a sea of white spreads out below, covering the vast green lawns of Rizal Park and expanding down arterial roads and sidestreets. It is formed of more than half a million people, clad in matching white T-shirts, the slogan \u201ctransparency for a better democracy\u201d emblazoned on their chests.\n\nAn estimated 650,000 of them have flooded the centre of Manila to protest, amid fury over a [spiralling corruption scandal]( in which billions of dollars in flood mitigation funds have evaporated. Organised by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a powerful sect in the Philippines, the three-day rally has shut down schools, roads and offices. Many of those protesting have camped out all night on the park\u2019s lawns, sleeping in tents or beneath tarpaulins and umbrellas. Families have journeyed from across the country to set up camp, some equipped with portable stoves and rice cookers, others pushing elderly family members in wheelchairs, many of them bearing placards saying \u201cexpose the deeds\u201d.\n\nThe focus of the fury is on company owners, government officials and parliament members accused of pocketing billions in funds for substandard or nonexistent flood protection projects. Since the scandal began, the country\u2019s economic planning minister has said up to 70% of public funds allotted for flood control may have been lost to corruption; [some senators]( have estimated 50%. Government investigators have discovered more than 400 \u201cghost\u201d flood protection projects that were reported to have been completed but turned out to be nonexistent.\n\nThe absence of those protections is felt keenly in the Philippines, where hundreds of people have died in typhoon-related flooding over the past month. More than 20 typhoons have hit the country\u2019s territory this year, and extreme weather increasingly derails daily life. As the rally formed on Sunday, authorities and families were still searching for those missing from [Typhoon Kalmaegi]( which ripped through the country in early November, killing at least 269. The 100 or so still missing are likely to also have been killed. Days after Kalgaemi blew through, [Typhoon Fung-wong]( arrived, causing more devastating floods, displacing 1.4 million people and killing another 28.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/17/manila-philippines-corruption-protest-flood-funds", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cuba is the country with the most convictions for arbitrary detention in the world, according to the UN", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-11-21/cuba-is-the-country-with-the-most-convictions-for-arbitrary-detention-in-the-world-according-to-the-un.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia and Ukraine exchange bodies of dead soldiers, 1000 Ukrainian bodies for 30 Russian bodies", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-received-1000-bodies-russia-2025-11-20/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
