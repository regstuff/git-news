Also, both the left mouse button and the right mouse button will bring up the system tray pop-up menu now. Double-clicking the system tray icon for Display Hot Keys to restore the application is no longer supported.\n\nThis release is only meant for single-monitor configurations because the scaling mode will likely apply to all attached monitors rather than just the primary monitor. Also, if you choose to go back to 1.0.0 after launching Display Hot Keys 1.1.0+, please delete the settings file in your Documents/DisplayHotKeys folder before launching 1.0.0. If you don't, weird things may happen since the ini management engine was changed to Ini4j for the 1.1.0 release, and the formatting is different with Ini4j. If you are using the setup file, I recommend uninstalling the old version prior to the installing the new version to prevent previous uninstall files from being left over in the program directory.
