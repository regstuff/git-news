But they weren't interested, and just took the note from his pocket to put on display.\n\nMe and my mum have some spare myheritage tests, and she wants to test this body to find who he is. I found the idea kinda unsettling, and asked why we cant just ask professionals to test the dna.\n\nShe said that they won't care, and that hiring them will just cost us extra money. But i don't think the normal dna test will work for a dead body. \n\nSo I want to know how we can find who he is, and if the normal myheritage test will work.\nWe want to know who this soldier was and who his family are.\n\nEdit: I made an error, turns out it was a German soldier and the note was in German.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1d4w5i3/my_mum_wants_to_test_the_remains_of_a_ww2_soldier/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Encoding Your Semantic Search Model With Sentence Transformers For A RAG Application", "summary": "Hello all,\n\n  \nA powerful Sentence Transformers v3 version has just been released that considerably improves the capabilities of this framework, especially its fine-tuning options!\n\n  \nSemantic search models based on Sentence Transformers are both accurate and fast which makes them a good choice for production grade inference.\n\n  \nSo I made a tutorial about how to create your own semantic search model based on Sentence Transformers and how to use it in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for question answering and chatbots:\n\n[  \n\n\nAny feedback will be much appreciated!
