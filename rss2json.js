It made the decision after the content was reported by a Polish anti-racism group.\n\nNews of the platform\u2019s action against Braun, who has 242,000 followers on TikTok, was first reported on Wednesday by\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*, a leading Polish daily, and later confirmed by the Reuters news agency.\n\nOne of the removed videos showed Braun, who is a member of the European Parliament,\u00a0[denying the existence of gas chambers](\u00a0at Auschwitz and saying that \u201cthere is fundamental doubt as to whether the Germans actually murdered six million Jews during World War II\u201d, reports\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita.*\n\nAnother celebrated the\u00a0[events of December 2023]( when Braun used a fire extinguisher to attack a ceremony in which Jewish leaders were lighting Hanukkah candles in parliament.\n\nThe third was a report from the anniversary of the\u00a0[Jedwabne pogrom](\u00a0in World War Two, during which hundreds of Jews were burned alive by their Polish neighbours under Nazi-German oversight.\n\nBraun was shown blocking the path of Poland\u2019s chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, and chanting, \u201cThis is Poland, not Polin!\u201d, referring to the name of Poland in Hebrew and Yiddish. That phase is often used by Braun and his supporters to suggest that Jews are seeking to control Poland.\n\nAnother deleted video encouraged people to financially support Janusz Walu\u015b, a Polish white nationalist who assassinated anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani in South Africa in 1993 with the aim of inciting a race war.\n\nWalu\u015b was\u00a0[recently released from prison](\u00a0in South Africa and returned to Poland, where he arrived at the airport accompanied by Braun.\n\nFinally, a video documenting Braun and his supporters\u00a0[tearing down a Ukrainian flag](\u00a0displayed on a Polish town hall as a sign of solidarity was also deleted by TikTok.\n\nThe content was removed after being reported by the Never Again Association, a Polish NGO that campaigns against racism, antisemitism and xenophobia. The association works with a number of social media platforms to help root out hateful content.\n\n\u201cTikTok approached us to be its social partner regarding content that may violate its terms and conditions and criminal provisions, including hate speech,\u201d the association\u2019s Rafa\u0142 Pankowski told\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*. \u201cWe merely report the content for review. The platform makes the decision to remove it.\u201d\n\nThe six deleted videos are just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d, Pankowski added in comments to Reuters. \u201cThere is simply a whole lot of such material\u2026I think that the worst thing in all this is that there is this element of glorification, incitement to violence.\u201d\n\nFar-right groups have been very successful on TikTok. S\u0142awomir Mentzen, a former ally of Braun, is the most popular Polish politician on the platform, with 1.6 million followers. That has helped him reach young voters, among whom[\u00a0far-right groups are especially popular](\n\nIn 2022,\u00a0[Facebook banned Confederation](\u00a0(Konfederacja), the far-right group that Mentzen leads (and to which Braun previously belonged), from its platform for \u201crepeated violations\u201d of its rules against hate speed and COVID-19 disinformation. However, it\u00a0[lifted the ban](\u00a0the following year.\n\nIn 2024, YouTube removed 11 of Braun\u2019s videos following reports by the Never Again Association that he was promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial and calls for violence against LGBT+ people.\n\nBraun rose to greater prominence last year on the back of a presidential campaign centred around\u00a0[antisemitic](\u00a0[anti-Ukrainian](\u00a0and\u00a0[anti-LGBT](\u00a0rhetoric.

But he said he would still be \u201cproud to present such candidates for the next term of parliament\u201d. Braun himself last month\u00a0[went on trial](\u00a0for a range of offences, including his 2023 attack on a Jewish religious celebration in parliament.\n\nBraun, a member of the European Parliament, rose to prominence last year on the back of a presidential campaign centred around\u00a0[antisemitic](\u00a0[anti-Ukrainian](\u00a0and\u00a0[anti-LGBT](\u00a0rhetoric. He finished a surprised\u00a0[fourth in the election]( with 6.3% of the vote, and his party is now averaging around 8% support in the polls.\n\nBut he has also faced accusations of sympathy towards Russia, and government spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka said on Tuesday that naming Piskorski as a candidate shows that \u201cBraun is no longer even trying to hide his connections with Russia\u201d.\n\nPiskorski, who between 2005 and 2007 was an MP representing the populist Self-Defence (Samoobrona) party, is known for his sympathetic views towards Russia. That is highly unusual in Poland, where animosity towards Russia is\u00a0[almost universal](\u00a0among the general public and political parties.\n\nIn 2014, Piskorski acted as the head of a group of \u201cindependent\u201d observers allowed to oversee Russia\u2019s referendum to annex Ukraine. Afterwards, Piskorski\u00a0[said](\u00a0that the referendum had been \u201cconducted in accordance with the law\u201d with \u201cno violations of generally accepted standards\u201d.\n\nHe also\u00a0criticised those who just \u201crepeat the arguments of one side of this conflict and use stereotypes like \u2018bad Russians'\u201d. He accused the West of being responsible for Vladimir Putin taking action against Ukraine, which he described as a \u201cfailed state\u201d.\n\nIn 2015, when establishing a new party in Poland called Change (Zmiana), Piskorski told Kremlin news outlet Sputnik that its aim was to \u201crebuild relations with Russia\u201d so the two countries would \u201conce again become partners\u201d. He also founded a think tank that has been\u00a0[accused](\u00a0of receiving Russian money.\n\nIn May 2016, Piskorski was detained by Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency (ABW) and charged with espionage on behalf of Russian and Chinese intelligence. Two years later, he was indicted to stand trial.\n\nIn April 2019, the trial began. But, almost seven years later, no verdict has been issued. Because the trial is classified, it is unknown what stage it is at or what evidence has been presented, notes OKO.press.\n\nMeanwhile, in May 2019, after being held in pretrial detention for three years, Piskorski was released on a 200,000 zloty (\u20ac47,500) bail but banned from leaving the country. Since then, he has regularly appeared as a commentator on Russian and Belarusian state-linked media outlets.\n\nLast year, another former member of Piskorski\u2019s Change party, named only as Janusz N. under Polish privacy law, was\u00a0[indicted by Polish prosecutors](\u00a0on charges of espionage on behalf of Russia.\n\nBraun himself has long been accused of having sympathies towards and links to Russia. In 2019,\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*, a leading Polish daily,\u00a0[published](\u00a0photos of Braun in Moscow the previous year meeting with Leonid Sviridov, a Russian journalist expelled from Poland in 2015 on suspicion of espionage.\n\nIn September last year, after Russian drones violated Polish airspace, Braun\u00a0[claimed](\u00a0that the incident was faked as part of a conspiracy, involving Poland\u2019s own government, to drag the country into the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn November, Braun and fellow KPP politicians wrote to Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov calling for a \u201cnormalisation in\u00a0Polish-Russian\u00a0relations\u201d.\u00a0[OKO.press]( notes that, during his recent political activity, Braun has been \u201copenly collaborating with pro-Russian figures\u201d.\n\nUntil a year ago, Braun and his KPP were part of Confederation (Konfederacja), a far-right alliance that sits in Poland\u2019s parliament. However, he was expelled after announcing a presidential run despite Confederation naming another of its leaders, S\u0142awomir Mentzen, as its candidate.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/07/polish-far-right-leader-braun-names-man-on-trial-for-russian-espionage-as-election-candidate/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel's foreign minister on historic visit to Somaliland", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyrexdgzn9o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan civil war: Children among 13 killed after drone hits home in el-Obeid city, medics say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74w54783zeo", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
