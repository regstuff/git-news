This followed reports in the international press\u2014including from the [New York Times]( and [CNN]( widespread physical abuse at the same detention center, Sde Teiman. The soldiers detained at Sde Teiman were brought for interrogation at another military base; Israeli protesters stormed both that base and Sde Teiman to demand that the soldiers be released. The protesters have been supported by right-wing cabinet ministers such as Bezalel Smotrich and [Itamar Ben-Gvir]( who referred to the accused soldiers as \u201cour best heroes.\u201d Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, has called for an investigation into whether Ben-Gvir, who is the national-security minister, purposely delayed the police from responding to the riots\n\n**How does the storming of these bases fit into the history of right-wing attempts to undermine the rule of law in Israel?**\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to keep in mind that we have had settler violence in the West Bank for many years, and it has been rising for years without enforcement, or close to no enforcement. So the settler community has been living for decades in a reality where they can break laws. I\u2019ll even take one step back and say the entire settlement project is a project that is drowning in criminality. \n\nWe have had decades of this kind of behavior in the West Bank, and unchecked violence where soldiers were given orders to stand idly by. When I was a soldier in the West Bank, our orders were not to enforce law on the settlers.\n\nWe moved from soldiers standing idly by while Palestinians were being attacked to soldiers sometimes even joining the attacks. Sometimes it was soldiers who were settlers, who were back at home in the settlement or the outpost where they live, or where their friends live, and the guys are organizing to go down and attack Palestinians, so they take their gun or come half in uniform and join the attack. Sometimes it\u2019s because specific military units were made up largely of extremist, nationalist, religious guys that the U.S. was even contemplating [restricting military assistance to]( But after October 7th things got even worse. Now the settlers are the soldiers and the soldiers are the settlers.\n\n**So you\u2019re saying that the biggest change is in the makeup of who the soldiers are?**\n\nIt\u2019s structural to the way the I.D.F. is designed. In a full-scale war, the better equipped, better trained units go to the front line. In our case, now, that\u2019s Lebanon and Gaza. So who stays in the West Bank? Reservists. But it\u2019s not only normal reserve units. It\u2019s also what are called regional-defense units. The West Bank is divided into several regional brigades. Each of them has regional-defense battalions, which are reservist units made of local settlers.\n\nLawlessness and violence was allowed because the relationship between the military and the settlers on the ground became so symbiotic. It is now so symbiotic that it\u2019s not clear any more where the military starts and ends, and where the civilians start and end.\n\nThere is a sociological change in the army. A change from the old-school, secular, Labor Party-oriented people to nationalist religious people, and especially to the ultra-Orthodox nationalists. People like Smotrich.\n\nIn 1990, only 2.5% of graduate officer cadets in the infantry were nationalist religious. In 2015, it was nearly 40%\n\nIn 2016, two Palestinian attackers stabbed a soldier. The Palestinians were shot. One of them was killed\u2014the other one was neutralized, laying on the ground. Minutes later, a military medic called Elor Azaria arrived and he shot one bullet into the head of the Palestinian\u2014basically executed him. Ultimately, Azaria was indicted, but there was outrage about the fact that he was indicted. And it got to a place where even Netanyahu, who was the Prime Minister, called the shooter\u2019s parents to show support. \n\nThat was the moment where the rank and file within the Army, plus the political base of the Likud Party and the Israeli right, essentially rebelled against the old guard who want to say that the I.D.F. is a professional army with discipline, who want to tell a story to the world of adherence to international law, checking ourselves, investigation, accountability. Now it became, \u201cIn our Army, we have different ethics than you, and we have a different idea of rule of law than you have. And it\u2019s unacceptable that a soldier will be indicted for this.\u201d\n\n[Here's a copy of the rest of the article](", "link": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-radicalization-of-israels-military", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish leader urges Nord Stream patrons to \u2018keep quiet\u2019 as pipeline mystery returns to spotlight", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/poland-nord-stream-gas-pipelines-tusk-russia-46ca2fb3f287570820564d1d5b6a8e29", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukrainian president says push into Russia\u2019s Kursk region is to create a buffer zone there", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ukrainian-troops-have-struck-two-key-bridges-in-russia-disrupting/", "author": "None"}, {"title": " English Translation of Prime Minister\u2019s Opening Remarks at the Inaugural Leaders\u2019 Session of the 3rd Voice of Global South Summit ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/38168/English+Translation+of+Prime+Ministers+Opening+Remarks+at+the+Inaugural+Leaders+Session+of+the+3rd+Voice+of+Global+South+Summit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Family Flees and a Mother Mourns After Israeli Settlers Attack a Palestinian Village", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1evbnu5/a_family_flees_and_a_mother_mourns_after_israeli/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Volcano erupts in Russia after 7.0 magnitude earthquake, sending ash column 5 miles high", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/17/world/earthquake-kamchatsky-tsunami-warning-russia-intl-latam/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u201cWe lost territory while they sent Moscow encouraging news\u201d: Russian official blasts superiors in leaked call amid Ukraine's Kursk offensive", "summary": "", "link": "https://theins.press/en/politics/273953", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nearly 68 million suffering from drought in Southern Africa, says regional bloc", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/southern-africa-en-nino-drought-rcna167002", "author": "None"}, {"title": "FTC bans fake online reviews, inflated social media influence;
