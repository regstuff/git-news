It streamlines the process of identifying and exploiting Wi-Fi networks by automating tasks such as network scanning, handshake capture, and brute-force password cracking. Key features include:\n\nAutomated Attacks: Air Script can automatically target all Wi-Fi networks within range, capturing handshakes without user intervention. Upon completion, it deactivates monitor mode and can send optional email notifications to inform the user. Air Script also automates Wi-Fi penetration testing by simplifying tasks like network scanning, handshake capture, and password cracking on selected networks for a targeted deauthentication.\n\nBrute-Force Capabilities: After capturing handshakes, the tool prompts the user to either provide a wordlist for attempting to crack the Wi-Fi passwords, or it uploads captured Wi-Fi handshakes to the WPA-sec project. This website is a public repository where users can contribute and analyze Wi-Fi handshakes to identify vulnerabilities. The service attempts to crack the handshake using its extensive database of known passwords and wordlists.\n\nEmail Notifications: Users have the option to receive email alerts upon the successful capture of handshakes, allowing for remote monitoring of the attack\u2019s progress.\n\nAdditional Tools: Air Script includes a variety of supplementary tools to enhance workflow for hackers, penetration testers, and security researchers. Users can choose which tools to install based on their needs.\n\nCompatibility: The tool is compatible with devices like Raspberry Pi, enabling discreet operations. Users can SSH into the Pi from mobile devices without requiring jailbreak or root access.", "link": "https://github.com/B3ND1X/air-script", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Taliban Rule Mandates Women Must Not Be Seen from Neighbors' Homes \u2013 KabulNow", "summary": "", "link": "https://kabulnow.com/2024/12/new-taliban-rule-mandates-women-must-not-be-seen-from-neighbors-homes/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kim Jong-un orders divorcing couples to labour camps under tough new rules", "summary": "", "link": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/kim-jong-un-orders-divorcing-090020111.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Examples of short NLP-Driven news analysis projects?", "summary": "Hello community,\n\nI have to supervise some students on a Digital Humanities project where they have to analyze news using Natural Language Processing techniques.
