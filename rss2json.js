I have a university work were, based on a QA dataset (it would help if it is annotated os that we can use entities to help our job with Knowledge Graphs) as our NLP origin dataset we must use knowledge graph to try to enhance it. But this project isn't worth a lot of our grade and should be easy to do. So, we need to find works where people used SQuAD questions to try to answer the best they could with NLP techniques. We need the code so then we can use it to also add information about the knowledge graph to see if the answer gets better with it. \n\nWhen we search about it we find this very big and confusing code that takes very long to train. And we honestly don't really know where to look for. Anyone knows where we could find a code to add the knowledge graph information to see if it is better than not having it?
