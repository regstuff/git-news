Russia says it still has legal right to the property, but that claim is rejected by city hall.\n\nThe Polish foreign ministry\u00a0[ordered the consulate to close](\u00a0by the end of 23 December, with employees required to leave Poland. The Russians, however, plan to leave a single \u201cadministrative and technical employee\u201d at the premises after that date to \u201censure the inviolability\u201d of the building, which they claim is legally theirs.\n\nThe villa on Batorego Street has been occupued by Kremlin diplomats since 1951, when Poland\u2019s communist authorities agreed to allow the Soviets to use the building for free, reports broadcaster TVN.\n\nPreviously, since the times of Tsar Peter the Great, Russia (and later the Soviet Union) had operated a consulate elsewhere in Gda\u0144sk. But it was seized by Nazi Germany in 1941, after Hitler declared war on the Soviet Union, then destroyed in 1945 during the Red Army\u2019s advance into the city.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is our property,\u201d Andrei Ordash, charge d\u2019affaires of the Russian embassy in Warsaw, told TVN. \u201cThis building was transferred to us in the early 1950s as compensation for property lost by the Soviet Union during the war; it is our property.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRussia has maintained this position for years. In 2013, Gda\u0144sk began charging fees for the building\u2019s use, but the consulate refused to pay. The city estimates unpaid fees from 2013 to 2023 at around 5.5 million zloty (\u20ac1.3 million), with interest adding another 3 million zloty.\n\nGda\u0144sk officials call Russia\u2019s position \u201cincomprehensible\u201d, saying that available documentation does not support Moscow\u2019s claims. According to the land and mortgage registers, the building is owned by the Polish state treasury.\n\nThe city\u2019s deputy mayor, Emilia Lodzi\u0144ska, announced on Monday that the city would pursue legal measures to reclaim the property.\n\n\u201cAfter obtaining a court ruling favourable to the Polish side, bailiff proceedings will be carried out, resulting in the seizure of the property,\u201d she said[.](\u00a0\u201cI would like to stress very clearly that we are acting and will continue to act within the framework of a democratic state governed by the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe city emphasised that the building would lose its protected status under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations at midnight on 23 December. However, the city estimates that recovering the building through legal means may in practice take two or three years.\n\n\u201cFollowing a relevant court ruling and transfer to the state treasury, the property will be available for reuse,\u201d said Emil Rojek, deputy governor of the Pomerania province in which Gda\u0144sk is located.\n\n\u201cBefore we make any decisions regarding the future use of this building, we must familiarise ourselves with its technical condition, what we will find there, and examine it in terms of safety. Then we will decide whether this property will be used for the needs of state authorities or in another way, for example commercially,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the municipal authorities in Warsaw\u00a0[seized a former Russian diplomatic compound](\u00a0that had likewise been claimed by Moscow as part of a long-running legal dispute.\n\nWarsaw had initially hoped to hand over the building to the local Ukrainian community. However, that proved unfeasible due to the poor condition of the site. It will instead be\u00a0[redeveloped into housing](\u00a0for municipal employees.\n\nIn 2022, Poland\u2019s State Forests likewise\u00a0[seized a property](\u00a0that Russia had refused to vacate despite failing to pay rent.\n\nSince last year, Poland has successively closed down all three of Russia\u2019s consulates in response to Moscow\u2019s campaign of sabotage on Polish territory. After the Gda\u0144sk consulate ceases to operate tomorrow, only the embassy in Warsaw will remain.\n\nIn retaliation, Moscow has\u00a0[ordered all of Poland\u2019s consulates](\u00a0on its territory to close.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/22/russia-refuses-to-hand-over-consulate-building-after-poland-orders-it-closed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh unrest: Hindu man lynched, body tied to tree and set on fire as tensions escalate - report", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-unrest-hindu-man-lynched-body-tied-to-tree-and-set-on-fire-as-tensions-escalate-report/articleshow/126071149.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia escalates attacks on key Ukrainian region of Odesa", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxe8yqlvgzo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Houthis, Yemen government to exchange nearly 3,000 prisoners", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/houthis-yemen-government-to-exchange-nearly-3000-prisoners/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli military says it is examining killing of Palestinian teen in West Bank", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-is-examining-killing-palestinian-teen-west-bank-2025-12-22/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudanese paramilitary drone attack kills 50, including 33 children in Kordofan, doctor group says", "summary": "A drone attack by the Sudanese paramilitary forces hit a kindergarten in south-central [Sudan]( killing 50 people, including 33 children, a doctors\u2019 group said.\n\nParamedics on the scene in the town of Kalogi in South [Kordofan]( state were targeted in \u201ca second unexpected attack,\u201d Sudan Doctors\u2019 Network said in a statement late Friday.\n\nEmergency Lawyers, a rights group tracking violence against civilians in Sudan reported in a statement Saturday the second strike on paramedics treating survivors in Kalogi and said \u201ca third civilian site near the previous two\u201d was also attacked.\n\nThe group condemned the attack, blaming the paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, for the strikes, calling them \u201ca flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians, especially children, and vital civilian infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe death toll is expected to be higher, but communication blackouts in the area have made it difficult to report casualties.\n\nThursday\u2019s attack is the latest in the fighting between the RSF, and the Sudanese military, who have been at war for over two years.

Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.\n\nIndian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.\n\nRal Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\n\n\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.\n\nIt isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.\n\nDuring its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.\n\nThe Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.\n\nThe BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students \u2013Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.\n\nMyanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.\n\nThis is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family \u2013 a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\n\n\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\n\n\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming \u2013 that this election is free and fair \u2013 this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"\n\nThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including Suu Kyi are in jail.\n\n\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.\n\nIang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"\n\nThe election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.\n\nAt the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"\n\nHe points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\n\n\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"\n\nAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.\n\nSui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.\n\nMany of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.\n\nAbel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.\n\nIn a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\n\n\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"\n\nThe impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.\n\nYet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.\n\nSome like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\n\n\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrjpdz33vxo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Damascus Dossier stories from around the world", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.icij.org/investigations/damascus-dossier/damascus-dossier-stories-from-around-the-world/?utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
