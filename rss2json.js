After granting the bill general approval, lawmakers began a lengthy article-by-article vote.\n\nThe bill still faces a test next month in the lower house, where some Senate amendments could be changed or reversed.\n\nSupporters of Milei\u2019s revamped labor law say high severance payouts and taxes make it almost impossible to fire employees, constraining productivity and discouraging business from formal employment. Almost half of Argentines work off the books. Private sector job growth has remained stagnant for 14 years.\n\nThe bill has drawn fierce opposition from [labor unions]( and [their Peronist allies]( who argue it would roll back measures that protect workers from abuse and the nation\u2019s [notoriously frequent]( economic shocks.\n\n\u201cIf severance pay, overtime and vacation time \u2014 in other words, all the protections workers have gained over time \u2014 are up for grabs, it won\u2019t make things better for anyone,\u201d said Axel Kicillof, the governor of Buenos Aires province and the most powerful elected official in the Peronist opposition.\n\nSuccessive governments, as well as a [military dictatorship]( have promised to overhaul Argentina\u2019s labor legislation and have failed. But after clinching a [big midterm victory]( last year, with [help from his ally]( U.S. President Donald Trump, Milei has a fresh mandate to enact reforms that for decades businesses have desired and international financial institutions have demanded.\n\nThe bill under discussion would curb the right to strike, extend trial periods during which companies can fire unproductive new employees, defang national trade unions by allowing collective bargaining at company level and unwind a byzantine system of severance payments by narrowing grounds for wrongful dismissal.", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/argentina-javier-milei-labor-law-trade-unions-11d1d6c0237c9f3ff60017450d6cf905", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Exclusive: U\u0405 military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-preparing-potentially-weeks-long-iran-operations-2026-02-13/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Condom shortage hits Winter Olympics as supplies vanish in just 3 days", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcboston.com/video/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/condom-shortage-hits-winter-olympics/3897966/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "French foreign minister faces criminal complaint over misquoting Francesca Albanese", "summary": "Lawyers group accuses Jean-Noel Barrot of spreading false information and exposing UN expert to risk of attacks after citing comments she did not make", "link": "https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/french-lawyers-seek-criminal-prosecution-foreign-minister-over-francesca-albanese-remarks", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Munich Security Conference 2026: Merz warns rules-based order 'no longer exists'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/munich-security-conference-2026-merz-warns-rules-based-order-no-longer-exists/ar-AA1Whsnp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh election: BNP wins historic first vote since overthrow of Hasina | Bangladesh", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/13/bangladesh-election-bnp-wins", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish president\u2019s deputy chief of staff charged in signature forgery case", "summary": "President Karol Nawrocki\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Adam Andruszkiewicz, has been charged by prosecutors with ordering the falsification of documents. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison.\n\nAndruszkiewicz denies the accusations, calling them a \u201ctrumped-up fairy tale\u201d and \u201cact of political revenge\u201d by the government against the office of Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nOn Wednesday, prosecutors announced that they have brought charges against Andruszkiewicz in a case that dates back to 2014, when he was the leader of All-Polish Youth (M\u0142odzie\u017c Wszechpolska), a prominent far-right group, in the Podlaskie province.\n\nThe accusations relate to claims that signatures of support for the nomination of local election candidates standing on behalf of the National Movement (Ruch Narodowy), another nationalist group aligned with All-Polish Youth, in Podlaskie were forged.\n\nNow, eleven and a half years after the investigation began, prosecutors have concluded that Andruszkiewicz was responsible for \u201cdirecting the forgery by other persons of documents\u201d.\n\nThey say one of the witnesses in the case gave testimony to this fact, which was then corroborated by other evidence, including further witness statements and handwriting analysis.\n\nIf found guilty of forgery, Andruszkiewicz would be imprisoned for up to five years. He also faces charges of violating the electoral process, punishable by up to three years in prison, and unlawfully processing personal data, which carries a potential two-year jail term.\n\nProsecutors say that, when he was summoned today to hear the charges, Andruszkiewicz did not plead guilty. The politician himself also took to social media to proclaim his innocence and suggest that the prosecution against him is politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThis charge is a completely trumped-up fairy tale used as a political weapon,\u201d he wrote, promising to \u201cdebunk this false narrative\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, last week, after prosecutors had summoned him to appear today, Andruszkiewicz called their actions \u201can obvious act of political revenge\u201d and part of \u201ca broader plan of constant attacks by the current ruling party on the chancellery of the president\u201d.\n\nSince Nawrocki came to power last year, he has regularly clashed with the more liberal government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nThe president himself has not yet commented on today\u2019s announcement. But he did come to the defence of his deputy chief of staff last week, after Andruszkiewicz had been summoned by prosecutors.\n\n\u201cTwelve years of investigation without evidence; clear and unanimous opinions from handwriting experts pointing to no connection of Adam Andruszkiewicz to the case \u2013 and suddenly, a revelation,\u201d wrote the president sarcastically on social media.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office acts slowly and selectively in this matter, but strangely enough, always in line with the expectations of the \u2018boss\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s mention of the \u201cboss\u201d is likely to be a reference either to Waldemar \u017burek, the justice minister and prosecutor general, or Tusk.\n\nSince coming to power in December 2023, Tusk\u2019s government has made holding to account figures associated with the former ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party one of its priorities. However, PiS accuses the authorities of weaponising the legal system against them for political reasons.\n\nAfter leaving All-Polish Youth, Andruszkiewicz was associated with a handful of other small right-wing parties before joining PiS in 2019 and becoming a deputy minister in the then PiS-led government.\n\nLast year, he was a senior figure in the presidential election campaign of Nawrocki, whose candidacy was supported by PiS. When Nawrocki became president in August, he appointed Andruszkiewicz as his deputy chief of staff.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/11/presidents-deputy-chief-of-staff-charged-in-signature-forgery-case/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
