Or is something else going on?", "summary": "We\u2019ve seen a flurry of moves from Washington lately that all hit India directly or indirectly:\n\n* **H-1B restriction:** A $100k \u201centry fee\u201d on employers bringing in H-1B workers from abroad. This mostly hits Indian IT firms since they dominate the category. Extensions inside the U.S. aren\u2019t affected.\n* **Tariffs on Indian exports:** Up to 50% tariffs on certain imports from India, officially justified as \u201creciprocity\u201d and tied to India\u2019s Russian oil buys + high tariff barriers.\n* **Pakistan/Saudi defense alignment:** Saudi and Pakistan announced a mutual defense pact. At the same time, Washington approved nearly $400m in F-16 sustainment for Pakistan. Trump even hosted Pakistan\u2019s army chief at the White House.\n* **Big claims on mediation:** Trump floated stopping war between India and Pakistan , which directly clashes with India\u2019s long-standing bilateralism policy (no third-party mediation).\n\n**So what\u2019s going on here?**\n\nPossible motives behind U.S. actions\n\n1. Market access pressure Agriculture is a sore spot especially dairy, poultry, meat, grains. Washington has long complained India blocks U.S. farm exports. Tariffs + H-1B restrictions could be aimed at forcing Delhi to open its ag market.\n2. Russia/BRICS angle The White House tied tariffs to India\u2019s Russian oil imports. With India active in BRICS+ and buying Russian crude, this could be punishment for hedging away from the West.\n3. Domestic politics The H-1B fee plays well with \u201cprotect U.S. jobs\u201d rhetoric. Tariffs and tough talk on trade are also core Trump campaign promises.\n4. Regional balancing The Saudi\u2013Pak pact and F-16 sustainment deal strengthen Islamabad. That may be about Gulf stability, but it also increases pressure on India\u2019s neighborhood.\n\n**Where Trump\u2019s team leans on India?**\n\n* USTR (Greer): Hardline reciprocity, tariffs as leverage.\n* State (Rubio): Wants India as a China counterweight, but hasn\u2019t stopped punitive measures.\n* Defense (Hegseth): Promotes \u201cMajor Defense Partnership\u201d with India, while simultaneously funding Pakistan\u2019s F-16 upkeep.\n* Commerce (Lutnick): Very blunt \u201cmake a deal\u201d or face tariffs.\n\n**What leverage does India have?**\n\nIndia is not without cards of its own:\n\n* Market size: U.S. firms (tech, defense, pharma, energy) want access to India\u2019s 1.4B-strong consumer base. Delhi can slow-roll approvals, licenses, and contracts to push back.\n* Defense purchases: India is a top buyer of U.S. defense gear (P-8I aircraft, drones, artillery). Delhi can diversify more toward France, Israel, or Russia if Washington squeezes too hard.\n* Strategic positioning: India is central to U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. With China tensions high, Washington cannot afford to push India too far toward Moscow or Beijing.\n* Energy deals: India buys large amounts of U.S. LNG and coal. This demand gives it negotiating room, especially if the U.S. wants stable buyers amid shifting global energy flows.\n* Tech/workforce ties: Indian IT services and H-1B talent underpin much of Silicon Valley\u2019s labor market. Too harsh a clampdown hurts U.S. companies as much as Indian outsourcers.\n* Global South influence: India has positioned itself as a leader of the Global South. If Washington alienates Delhi, it risks weakening its standing in multilateral forums where India has rising influence.\n\n**The big question for India watchers**\n\nIs this really about forcing India to buy U.S. ag products and open its market, or is agriculture just one card in a bigger game , Russia alignment, BRICS politics, and regional balancing with Pakistan/Saudi?\n\nAnd if it is about ag, how far would Trump go more tariffs, squeezing visas further, or dangling defense tech? On the flip side, how far would India lean on its market size, defense purchases, and strategic weight to push back?\n\nBottom line: India is being pressured on multiple fronts, but it also has leverage. The U.S. can escalate, but too much pressure risks India tilting further toward strategic autonomy or even closer to Moscow/Beijing. Whether this ends in a grand bargain (ag + trade for defense/tech + visa relief) or a drawn-out standoff will depend on how both sides play their cards.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1nmgeoh/is_trump_using_h1b_fees_tariffs_and_pakistan/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - evoluteur/isomorphic-table-cards: Table and Cards views with animated transitions on sorting, switching view, and browser resizing (no dependencies, just vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML).", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/evoluteur/isomorphic-table-cards", "author": "None"}, {"title": "California bans most law enforcement officers from wearing masks during operations", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/california-ice-agents-immigration-raids-masks-ban-97936f70699b75d8b483a850967c2e42", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anti-immigration protesters attack officers, set police car ablaze in The Hague", "summary": "", "link": "https://nltimes.nl/2025/09/20/anti-immigration-protesters-attack-officers-set-police-car-ablaze-hague", "author": "None"}, {"title": "uqaabOS: 32bit OS for learning purpose", "summary": "minimal OS for learning purpose", "link": "https://github.com/faishal882/uqaabOS", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Strike action across France as hundreds of thousands join protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/strike-action-across-france-as-hundreds-of-thousands-march-to-demand-pm-rethinks-budget-cuts", "author": "None"}, {"title": "#MCExplainer | $100,000 visa wall: How Trump\u2019s H-1B move could reset India-US talent, tech and hiring", "summary": "Picture this: you\u2019re an Indian software engineer, dream job at a Big Tech firm in the\u00a0US secured.
