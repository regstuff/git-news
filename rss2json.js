The goal: force a political/diplomatic collapse of Pakistan\u2019s control over Pakistan-occupied Jammu &amp; Kashmir (PoJK) through pressure, not invasion.\n\nStarts by locking in diplomatic cover: Russia quietly shields India at global forums, Israel supplies intelligence/diplomatic backing, and China is offered incentives to sit neutral, not because it loves India, but because economic and strategic ties make overt backing of Pakistan risky. \n\nNext: make credible, visible deterrence without crossing legal red lines. The purpose is psychological: show Pakistan you\u2019re ready and capable while staying inside international boundaries. At the same time, run a sustained global information push that highlights anti-government protests, governance failures, and human-rights complaints inside PoJK so the narrative becomes about the people, not just territory.India would rely on visible, legal deterrence rather than covert invasion: the Navy and Air Force would be put on high alert and repositioned visibly within international limits to signal capability, while ground forces remain mobilized defensively at home. Allied support would be framed as diplomatic and symbolic ,Russia publicly positioned as a humanitarian/diplomatic backstop (not an active combat partner), with any Russian presence described as political cover and contingency assistance to prevent wider chaos; Afghan actors and Baloch dissent would be treated as internal pressure factors to monitor, not as directed proxies. The public justification would stress humanitarian concern for PoJK protesters and requests for diplomatic stances from partners\u2014keeping the focus on restraint, legal posturing, and international legitimacy rather than operational escalation.\n\nExpect Iran and Afghanistan to matter. Iran will publicly urge restraint and emphasize regional stability, Tehran prefers steady trade routes and avoids moves that could trigger wider instability. Afghanistan (including de facto actors there) is a wild card: porous borders and militant groups mean the ground picture can be chaotic and could be used by Islamabad or opponents as leverage. \n\nWhat about the U.S. and the rest of the world? The U.S. will likely push for de-escalation publicly while privately recalibrating ties \u2014 Washington values stability and counterterror cooperation, so it will avoid actions that cause outright war but may quietly shift its posture if Pakistan looks weak and unstable. That diplomatic ambiguity is useful \u2014 it prevents Pakistan from getting a guaranteed external bailout.If Pakistan feels diplomatically isolated and its internal protests grow, the Pakistani state risks political fracture without a single shot being fired. Economic pressure, narrative isolation, and the visible readiness of Indian forces could create a scenario where Islamabad is forced to negotiate, accept international monitoring, or cede administrative control over contested areas, at least temporarily.\n\nNow the dark scenario: all\u2011out war. If things cross that line, expect immediate and severe consequences. South Asia is a nuclearized theatre: any conventional escalation risks rapid escalation to nuclear alerts, international emergency diplomacy, broad sanctions, and economic catastrophe for the whole region. Global powers - the U.S., China, and Russia would be dragged in diplomatically if not materially. The humanitarian and refugee crises would be enormous, trade would collapse, and long-term instability across Central and South Asia would spike. RAND-style analysis of escalation dynamics shows that wars between nuclear-armed neighbors generate disproportionate regional and global crises. But this shouldn't happen , either of the countries should back off. \n\nBackups and allies in an extreme scenario would matter only for as long as they\u2019re politically willing to be seen as complicit. Russia can offer diplomatic cover and some military cooperation, Israel can provide intelligence and political support, and Iran might stay pragmatic publicly. But any state giving overt military help risks sanctions, global isolation, and a messy long-term payoff. In short: alliances matter, but the reputational and economic costs of an all\u2011out war are enormous.\n\nBottom line: the smart move is coercion-with-restraint. Make Pakistan fear the cost of holding PoJK while convincing the rest of the world it\u2019s a human-rights and governance issue, not naked aggression.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ny3b8x/i_think_we_can_reclaim_pok_diplomatically/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ARR outstanding review (not reviewer) recognition", "summary": "Hi all!\n\nI wanted to ask if any of y'all recall this website that lists the name of reviewers and the number of \"outstanding/helpful reviews\" they got - I think this was for EMNLP 2024, and iirc you could also search any reviewer's name and it'll show how many of the reviews (back then I think each had to do 4 reviews for each paper you have your name on) got that helpful review stamp.

Resolve subjects with decisions + rationale + action items\n4. Handle pre-implementation tasks (refactoring, setup)\n5. /flow-implement\\_start - Now code with clarity\n\nEverything lives in a\u00a0[PLAN.md](\u00a0\\- context never lost.\n\nExample: Adding user authentication? Brainstorm session vs JWT, password hashing, rate limiting. Make decisions with reasoning. Realize your database layer needs updating first? Document it, fix it, then implement auth properly\n\nThe difference:\n\nBefore: AI jumps into code \u2192 realize architecture is wrong \u2192 refactor hell  \nor: You plan for 5 hours -&gt; AI Jumps into code -&gt; ai loses context/starts a new session -&gt; AI goes bananas making stuff up even though you didn't agree on it -&gt; 40 minutes later you've got 40 new files you've no idea what to do with.\n\nAfter: Brainstorm architecture (sessions vs JWT?) \u2192 Document decisions with WHY \u2192 Spot refactoring needs BEFORE coding \u2192 Implement cleanly in small iterations with full context \u2192 Anyone can pick up where you left off -&gt; loop again with the next iteration/task until the feature is done.\n\nIt is Free/Open Source (MIT License).  \nit is a Single file (bash script, no dependencies).  \nIt creates 18 slash commands for Claude Code.  \nBorn from real usage (distilled from building a complex game engine feature).\n\nHonest take: Only works with Claude Code right now.  \nCan feel heavy for simple features. But for complex stuff where architecture matters? Game changer for keeping AI focused.\n\nAnd while it works mainly with Claude Code, the slash commands are just convenience - the real power is the methodology. You can use it WITHOUT slash commands, just by referencing the framework and maintaining your\u00a0[PLAN.md](\u00a0file. The file is made WITH the AI, not BY the AI. You're in control.\n\nInspired by frustrations with Spec-Kit/Taskmaster - different purpose than both, fills a gap I kept hitting.\n\nGitHub:\u00a0[\n\nor Install:\n\n    curl -O \n    chmod +x flow.sh &amp;&amp; ./flow.sh\n\nFeedback welcome!", "link": "https://github.com/khgs2411/flow", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
