Taking advantage, Japan has been carving out Manchuria, Northern China, for itself, with its occupying Kwantung Army.*  \n\n*Yet the Japanese wanted a Chinese puppet to preserve the illusion of Manchu self-determination - and who better than the pliable former Chinese emperor, Pu Yi, himself a Manchu?* \n\n*The occupying Japanese kept the former Chinese emperor from actual executive rule, keeping close watch on him. After a year as Pu Yi serving as Japanese Manchuria's chief executive, it was time for the Japanese to make good their promise to make him emperor. Yet there's a bit of protocol to overcome..*\n\nIn October, 1933... the new commander of the Kwantung Army, Hishikari, informed me that the Japanese government was now prepared to recognize me as the \u201cEmperor of the Manchukuo Imperial State.\u201d \n\nAs soon as I received this news I was so happy that all the flowers in my heart burst into full blossom. My first thought was that I must have a set of imperial dragon robes to wear. \n\nThese robes were brought to Manchuria from Peking where they had been in the keeping of one of the High Consorts, but the Kwantung Army informed me that since Japan was recognizing me as \u201cEmperor of Manchukuo\u201d and not as the Great Ch\u2019ing Emperor, I could not wear the dragon robes of the Ch\u2019ing Dynasty at my coronation. \n\nI was told to wear the dress uniform of a Grand Marshal of the Land, Sea and Air Forces of Manchukuo. \u201cHow can this be?\u201d I asked Cheng Hsiao-hsu (Pu Yi's prime minister).  \n\n\u201cI am the descendant of the ruling Aisin-Gioro clan. How can I ignore my ancestral regulations? All the Manchu nobility from Peking will come to see me crowned. What will I look like if I wear a Western-style uniform when I ascend the throne?\u201d\n\n(BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATIONS HERE)\n\nThis time the Kwantung Army agreed to let me wear my dragon robes when I paid tribute to heaven. \n\nOn the early morning of March 1, 1934, at the Apricot Flower Village in the suburbs of Changchun, on an earthern \u201cAltar of Heaven\u201d that had been piled up for the occasion, I wore the dragon robes and performed the ancient ritual of announcing my ascension to heaven. Later, on my return to the city, I changed into a marshal\u2019s uniform and went through the actual ceremony of my ascension to the throne.\n\nFrom *The Last Manchu: The Autobiography of Henry Pu Yi, Last Emperor of China*", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1cwda90/the_japanese_want_to_crown_the_last_chinese/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "2700-Year-Old Necropolis Discovered in Italy", "summary": "", "link": "https://ulukayin.org/2700-year-old-necropolis-discovered-in-italy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How the Nile has changed course over the past 5,000 years", "summary": "\nThis map shows how the course of the Nile river in Egypt has changed over the past 5,000 years.
