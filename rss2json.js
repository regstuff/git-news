But the ouster triggered more violence. Police went on strike and mobs rampaged across the country until a new [interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus]( was sworn in. \n\n###What is the interim government focused on?\n\nSince he was sworn in, Yunus [declared that his key tasks would be to restore peace]( and law and order, fight corruption, and prepare for new elections.\n\nHis Cabinet, which includes two student leaders who spearheaded the protests, has fixed its sights on overhauling and reforming Bangladesh\u2019s institutions, from its courts and police to the Election Commission. To do this, it\u2019s also seeking support from the United Nations Development Program. \n\nThe 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who pioneered microcredit to help impoverished people, especially women, asked for patience in an address to the nation. \n\n###What is the mood in Bangladesh? \n\nUnrest persists. Garment workers demanding better wages have forced about 100 factories to shut down and tensions are simmering, with lingering but widespread anger against Hasina and her Awami League. \n\nHasina, now in self-imposed exile, is facing murder charges in more than 100 cases. Key officials perceived as close to her resigned after mass protests.\n\nMany cases have also been registered against those associated with Hasina, her party or her government \u2014 from former ministers and judges to journalists and even a prominent cricket player. They\u2019ve been attacked, stopped from leaving the country and even jailed. Rights groups have also condemned these lump charges. \n\n###What about the students?\n\nWithin a week of unseating Hasina, [the students who drove her out were directing traffic]( in the capital, Dhaka.\n\nSome schools and universities have since reopened, including Dhaka University, which became the epicenter for the protests against Hasina. But things are not back to normal yet.\n\nMany heads of educational institutions have been forced to resign and in some cases, even though classes have formally restarted, few students are attending them. \n\n###What\u2019s next?\n\nThere is a sense that normalcy is slowly returning \u2014 Dhaka\u2019s streets are no longer a battleground between security forces and students. Internet is back on and a [nationwide curfew with a shoot-on-sight order]( has been lifted. \n\nWith much of the violence eased, shops, banks, hotels and restaurants are open, and police \u2014 who went on strike over fears for their own safety \u2014 are back at work.\n\nHowever, their morale is low. Officers are less visible on the streets and seemingly unwilling to tackle disturbances as their crackdown remains fresh in the people's minds.\n\nDozens of police were killed during the uprising, their stations torched and looted.\n\nAnother challenge is restoring the economy, which was disrupted by the weekslong shutdown during the uprising, sending prices of food and commodities soaring.\n\nThe biggest question is: When will the new elections be held?\n\nSome experts say the interim government doesn\u2019t have the mandate to enact major reforms and that it should focus on building consensus among political parties on reforms \u2014 and schedule the polls.

My parents were the inaugural homeowners in the 1960s, the 1st owners.  \n\n\n\n  \nWithin this neighborhood, the streets are named after distinguished military figures from England, spanning various eras from the American Revolution to World War II.

Frankford Ave. aka The King's Highway  was built by #King George II from 1682 to the late 1790's. [ - Those dates were all before The American #Revolution and Civil War, so regardless of the construction date of Grant Ave, I would still say the name Grant Ave. has absolutely nothing at all to do with Ulysses S. Grant.  \n  \nWe also have Portis Rd.  which is a combination of 2 words = La Porte + Paris = Portis -  [ - La Porte was named Intendant of the Civil List (Minister of the Royal Household) in December 1790 which gave him direct control of the large sums of #money that were considered the private wealth of the King of France and so not subject to public audit.  \n  \nAcross the street from my home is Durand Road.  Durand was the name of the fake ID they gave to the King of France during the #French Revolution when the King of #France and his family tried to escape with Barron Batz. See p24 hosted on the University of Chicago's website: [ - More on Barron Batz can be found in your local library, or here: [ - Keep in mind, Louis XVI's grandfather Louis XIV had 30 children.  \n  \nWhen my parents moved in, the area was all farmlands.  Directly across the street from us at 1855 Melmar Road 19006 was the country home of Nicholas Biddle w/ 33 Rooms, &amp; 9 Bathrooms.  Though, there was nothing in between us except empty fields, there house was about 1,000 feet away. [ - He was the President of the Second Bank of the United States.

At the bottom of the hill is Huntingdon Valley aka Lower Moreland. Bryn Athyn, and #Hollywood, PA are at the top of the valley.  \n  \nOn the other side of the valley, at the top of that hill, is Abington, PA.

Built in 1640 it frequented visitors such as:  John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and even George Washington slept here.  The school located on the grounds, has now relocated as the Valley Forge Military Academy.

They were a 20th-century metal fabricator, a major supplier of body components to the automobile industry, and a manufacturer of stainless steel passenger rail cars, airframes, missile and space vehicles, and various defense products. [ - During WW2, they switched production from rail cars to war heads &amp; various Military Equipment.  During their tenor, they left behind contaminated land, from PCB's oil leakage, and Radioactive Waste.  Though, I had the radioactive reports 5 years ago before covid, which described the radioactivity levels, stretching as far south as Bustleton Road, via an underground creak, that crosses Red Line Rd just about 100ft north of Bustleton Ave, I do not have those links anymore, ...maybe on an old computer.   \n  \nI did recently find the reports where the NCR, The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff has terminated the license held by the Budd Company for another facility in Philadelphia, which may have occurred at both locations, as this location, which consisted of 75 acres was their main manufacturing facility, and the other may have been primarily used for offices, mailing address, and smaller manufacturing. [ -   \n  \nThe Budd Company operated a hot cell facility in Philadelphia from l956 through l967 to manufacture sealed sources for use in industrial radiography. (A hot cell is a heavily shielded enclosure in which radioactive materials are handled by persons using remote manipulators, such as mechanical arms, and viewed through shielded windows or periscopes.) A small amount of unsealed cesium-137 was also used for a brief time at the facility.  \n  \nIn addition, we also have Laramie Road.  I always wondered what the meaning of Laramie meant, as I have seen roads all over the world with the same name, such as in Canada.    \n  \nThe Laramie Mountains in Black Hills / Paha Sapa, USA was one of the largest Uranium mining sites in the USA.

I bought my 1st home in 2004, in the 19115, When they got old &amp; sick, I had to move back in w/ them &amp; keep my home vacant.  We wanted to prevent them from going into a nursing home, and also having the nursing home take away their home. We had nurses, round the clock for 24 hours. I was not embarrassed living with my parents.  I actually enjoyed it very much.  We would eat dinner together every day.  We never argued.  My whole life I was never yelled at.  They were a lot older than me, and as their age progressed, things became tough.  I had to cook for them 3 meals a day, and do everything for them... because I didn't want to put them in a nursing home.  One time, my vegan diet gave my father low iron, low hemoglobin (which requires a blood transfusion to fix immediately), it makes you weak, and you can't move.... So, I had to sleep on the floor next to him for a month. I didn't know about the Nutrition Tracking Meal Diary Cell Phone Free App called [www.cronometer.com](www.cronometer.com) at that time.

The financial assistance was crucial for the American colonists in their fight against British rule. Here are the details of how the money was distributed:  \n  \nFinancial Agreements: In February 1778, France and the United States signed the Treaty of Alliance, formally allying France with the American colonists. As part of this agreement, France pledged its support, including financial aid, to the United States.  \n  \nLoans: France provided substantial loans to the United States to fund their war efforts. The most significant loan came in 1778 when the French government arranged a loan of 2 million livres (a French currency) from the French banking house of Le Couteulx et Cie. This initial loan was followed by additional loans, including a total of 10 million livres in 1779 and 24 million livres in 1780.  \n  \nSupplies and Military Aid: In addition to financial assistance, France also provided military supplies and aid to the American colonists. The French Navy played a crucial role in the war by assisting in naval blockades and engaging in key battles, such as the Battle of Yorktown in 1781, which was a decisive victory for the Americans. The French military support included troops, warships, weapons, and ammunition.  \n  \nBenjamin Franklin's Role: Benjamin Franklin, the American envoy to France, played a significant role in negotiating and securing French support. He worked closely with the French government to secure financial aid and other resources for the American cause. Franklin's diplomacy and influence were instrumental in obtaining French assistance.  \n  \nDistribution of Funds: The funds received from France were primarily managed by the Continental Congress, the governing body of the American colonies during the Revolutionary War. Congress used the funds to pay for various war-related expenses, such as purchasing supplies, equipping troops, and maintaining military operations. Some funds were also used to pay off existing debts.  \n  \nIt is important to note that while Louis XVI and France's support was crucial for the American cause, the financial aid alone did not guarantee victory in the war. The American colonists faced numerous challenges throughout the conflict, and the outcome of the war was determined by a combination of factors, including military strategy, perseverance, and the support of other nations such as Spain and the Netherlands.  \n  \n\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34  \n  \n\u26a1 Family Relationships of France &amp; England    \n  \nLouis XVI's wife, Marie Antoinette, and King George III's wife, Queen Charlotte, were sisters-in-law as they both came from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine through their mother, Maria Theresa. This made Louis XVI and King George III brothers-in-law by marriage.  \n  \nIn addition, there were also related by blood by former ancestors.  \n  \nThe British and French royal families have a long history of intermarriage, resulting in blood connections between the two dynasties. Here are some key relationships that link the British and French royal families:  \n  \nThe House of Stuart and the House of Bourbon: One significant connection between the two royal families was through the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, a member of the Stuart dynasty, to Francis II of France, who belonged to the House of Valois-Bourbon. Their son, James VI of Scotland (later James I of England and Ireland), became the first monarch of the Stuart dynasty to rule over England and Scotland, effectively uniting the crowns from 1567 to 1625.  \n  \nThe House of Hanover and the House of Bourbon: The Hanoverian dynasty in Britain began with the accession of George I in 1714. The Hanoverians were related to the French Bourbon dynasty through Sophia of Hanover, whose mother was Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James VI and I. Sophia's uncle, Charles I of England and Scotland, married Henrietta Maria of France, a member of the House of Bourbon. Therefore, there was a blood connection between the Hanoverians and Bourbons through the Stuart lineage.  \n  \nThe House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the House of Orl\u00e9ans: In the 19th century, the British royal family, known as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later renamed the House of Windsor), had a connection to the French royal family through Queen Victoria. In 1840, Victoria married Prince Albert, who was a member of the German noble House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Their daughter, Princess Victoria, married Prince Louis of Battenberg, whose mother was a member of the House of Orl\u00e9ans, a branch of the French royal family.  \n  \nEdward III and Isabella of France: Edward III of England, who reigned from 1327 to 1377, was married to Philippa of Hainault. However, a significant blood connection between the British and French royal families came through Edward III's mother, Isabella of France. Isabella was the daughter of King Philip IV of France, making Edward III a grandson of a French king.  \n  \nThese are only a few examples of how the British and French royal families were related.   \n  \nWhile these connections highlight the historical ties between the British, The Royal Family, and French royal families, it is important to note that they represent a small portion of the complex web of intermarriages among European royal houses throughout history. The relationships between the two dynasties were often influenced by political considerations, diplomatic alliances, and the desire to strengthen familial connections among European monarchies.  \n  \nMatt Falcone - [  \n215-888-8080  \n[MF@LaserLightShow.ORG](mailto:MF@LaserLightShow.ORG)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1fank6p/maps_of_history_the_house_of_orleans_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "All Newborns in IL to get testing for rare genetic disorder thanks to suburban family, early life detection allows for minimal impact later in life", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/all-illinois-newborns-to-be-screened-for-genetic-disorder-thanks-to-oswego-family/3538266/?amp=1&amp;os=io..&amp;ref=app", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Asteroid burns up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere over Philippines", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/science/asteroid-strike-philippines-luzon-island/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Video footage appears to show Russians killing surrendering Ukrainian soldiers", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/06/europe/video-russia-surrendering-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-intl-cmd/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Missing 3-Year-Old Wisconsin Boy Found in 100-Acre Cornfield: See the Video", "summary": "", "link": "https://people.com/missing-wisconsin-boy-found-in-100-acre-cornfield-8706347", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
