Recognition means having heard a word or phrase before and understanding its meaning.\n\nI need this for a couple of things.\n\n- I'm building a pun generator to crack jokes like Jimmy Carr. Puns flop hard if people don't recognize the starting words or phrases.\n\n- I want to level up my British vocab. I'd rather learn stuff most Brits know than random obscure bits.\n\nWhile my focus is on British English, a dataset like this could also work for general English.\n\nI'm thinking of using language models to evaluate millions of words and phrases.\n\nHere's exactly what I'm looking for:\n\n- All the titles from Wiktionary should be in there so we've got all the basic language covered.\n\n- All the titles from Wikipedia need to be included too for all the cultural stuff.\n\n- Each word and phrase needs a score, like \"80% of Brits know this.\"\n\n- The prompt needs a benchmark word to normalize scores across multiple evaluation runs by adjusting everything else proportionally if the benchmark's score changes.\n\n- The language model needs to give the same output for the same input every time so results can be verified before any model updates change the recognizability scores.\n\n- It should get updated every year to keep up with language shifts like \"Brexit.\"\n\n- If I build this myself, I want to keep the total compute cost under $1,000 per year.\n\nRegular frequency lists just don't cut it:\n\n- They miss rare words people still know. \"Pellucid\" is just a rare word by itself, while \"ungooglable\" comes from \"Google\" which everyone knows.\n\n- With single words, it's doable but complicated. You need to count across all forms like \"knock,\" \"knocks,\" \"knocked,\" and \"knocking.\"\n\n- Phrases are trickier. With the phrase \"knock up\", you need to count across all the different objects like \"knock my flatmate up,\" and \"knock her up.\" She has a pun in the oven.\n\nI'm curious if there's a smarter way to do it.
