LLM-based reranking kicks in only when needed (when candidates exceed 50% of retrieval limit), which keeps costs down while maintaining quality.\n\n**Background consolidation**\n\nMemory operations happen after responses complete, so there's no blocking. The LLM analyzes context and generates CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE operations that get validated before execution.\n\n**Skip detection**\n\nTwo-stage filtering prevents unnecessary processing:\n\n* Regex patterns catch technical content immediately (code, logs, commands, URLs)\n* Semantic classification identifies instructions, calculations, translations, and grammar requests\n\nThis alone eliminates most non-personal messages before any expensive operations run.\n\n**Caching strategy**\n\nThree separate caches (embeddings, retrieval results, memory lookups) with LRU eviction. Each user gets isolated storage, and cache invalidation happens automatically after memory operations.\n\n**Status emissions**\n\nThe system emits progress messages during operations (retrieval progress, consolidation status, operation counts) so users know what's happening without verbose logging.\n\n# Configuration\n\nDefault settings work out of the box, but everything's adjustable through valves, more through constants in the code.\n\n    model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite (LLM for consolidation/reranking)\n    embedding_model: gte-multilingual-base (sentence transformer)\n    max_memories_returned: 10 (context injection limit)\n    semantic_retrieval_threshold: 0.5 (minimum similarity)\n    enable_llm_reranking: true (smart reranking toggle)\n    llm_reranking_trigger_multiplier: 0.5 (when to activate LLM)\n\n# Memory quality controls\n\nThe consolidation prompt enforces specific rules:\n\n* Only store significant facts with lasting relevance\n* Capture temporal information (dates, transitions, history)\n* Enrich entities with descriptive context\n* Combine related facts into cohesive memories\n* Convert superseded facts to past tense with date ranges\n\nThis prevents memory bloat from trivial details while maintaining rich, contextual information.\n\n# How it works\n\n**Inlet (during chat):**\n\n1. Check skip conditions\n2. Retrieve relevant memories via semantic search\n3. Apply LLM reranking if candidate count is high\n4. Inject memories into context\n\n**Outlet (after response):**\n\n1. Launch background consolidation task\n2. Collect candidate memories (relaxed threshold)\n3. Generate operations via LLM\n4. Execute validated operations\n5.

Naturally, that means fewer tokens are used.\n\nExample:  \nEnglish: Rewrite the paragraph concisely, keep a professional tone, and include exactly one actionable next step at the end. (23 Tokens)\n\nSpanish: Reescribe conciso, tono profesional, y a\u00f1ade un \u00fanico siguiente paso. (16 Tokens)\n\nThis could be a significant shift as the world might move toward using other languages besides English to prompt LLMs for optimisation on that front.\n\nUse cases could include internal routing of large agents or tool calls, where using a more compact language could help optimize the context window and prompts to instruct the LLM more efficiently.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure where this will lead, but think of it like programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python, each has its own features but ultimately serves to instruct machines.
