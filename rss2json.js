My research aims to create a 3D model of the site, mapping features up to 6 meters in depth using electromagnetic wave and electrical resistivity responses (non-invasive methods).\n\nA few days ago, I had the opportunity to meet researchers from EFEO (\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient) who visited our site. During our conversation, one of them\u2014a fellow Indonesian\u2014shared that he had originally majored in English Literature before pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Archaeology at SOAS University of London. This opened a jar of hope for me, as I\u2019ve been obsessed with archaeology since childhood.\n\nNow that I know such a path is possible, I\u2019m seriously considering pursuing a master\u2019s degree abroad. However, the universities I\u2019m interested in\u2014Leiden University (Netherlands), Lund University (Sweden), and Heidelberg University (Germany)\u2014require a background in an archaeology-related bachelor\u2019s degree (BA). This raises a few concerns:\n\n1.How difficult would it be for someone with my background (BEng) to transition into archaeology at these institutions?\n\n2. Would my thesis be enough to strengthen my application?\n\n3. To what extent does my home country\u2019s academic and political landscape influence my chances of acceptance?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any insights or advice on this.
