However, I\u2019m facing some issues:\n\n* I access it via **URL and API Key**, which works well, but it still relies on my computer running Docker, which is not ideal for mobile use.\n* Data is temporarily stored on the phone, and when connected to my home network, it syncs with the database on my computer, but this process is not smooth.\n\nMy goal is to **package Open Web UI into a native mobile app** with the following requirements:\n\n* **Native mobile app**: Users can access Open Web UI directly on their phones without a browser.\n* **Data sync**: Data is only stored locally on the phone, and when connected to the home network, it syncs with the database on the computer, with updates reflected in real time.\n* **Avoid Docker**: No longer rely on Docker running on the computer, but package the entire system into a native app, simplifying the user experience.\n\nI asked ChatGPT, and it responded:\n\n&gt;\n\nMy questions for the community:\n\n1. **How** can we migrate Open Web UI into a **native app** while ensuring **local server sync**?\n2. Are there alternatives to **Docker deployment** that avoid the need for running Docker on a computer to provide services?\n3. How can we handle **data sync** and **API calls** while avoiding permission and platform-specific issues (iOS/Android)?\n4. How can we ensure this solution is **user-friendly** for **non-technical users**, making it **plug-and-play**?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts, feasibility insights, and experiences with similar implementations!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1mzm5i3/open_web_ui_native_mobile_app_how_to_replace/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "VET - The Open Source Snyk Alternative", "summary": "vet is an open source **next-gen software composition analysis** tool with **malicious package detection**.
