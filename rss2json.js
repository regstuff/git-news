But they have now all been withdrawn, in large part due to the threat of losing European funds.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday this week, councillors in the county of \u0141a\u0144cut in southeast Poland held an extraordinary session with just one item on the agenda: whether to retain or repeal a so-called \u201ccharter of family rights\u201d they had adopted in 2019. A majority of 13 out of the 18 council members voted to repeal it.\n\nIn a\u00a0[statement](\u00a0issued afterwards, the local authorities made clear that the decision had been made for financial reasons: due to the charter being in place, the county\u2019s only medical centre is set to miss out on 750,000 zloty (\u20ac175,600) in EU funds.\n\n\u201cThe \\[council\\] is of the view that the over 80,000-strong community of \u0141a\u0144cut county cannot be deprived of benefits resulting from participation in many programmes and grants,\u201d they wrote.

Some specifically declared their regions to be \u201cfree from LGBT ideology\u201d, but most were the so-called \u201ccharters of family rights\u201d, which do not mention the term \u201cLGBT\u201d specifically.\n\nInstead, they express support for marriage as being exclusively between a man and a woman and pledge to \u201cprotect children from moral corruption\u201d (language\u00a0[often used as part of anti-LGBT rhetoric](\n\nAfter repealing its charter of family rights, \u0141a\u0144cut council maintained that it had \u201cnot contained any provisions discriminating against any group of people or individuals\u201d. It hit out at the \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d criticism the resolution had faced.\n\n\u201cIt shows that the people or groups criticising the resolution in question probably did not even familiarise themselves with its entire contents,\u201d wrote the local authority.\n\n\n\nHowever, the LGBT rights activists behind the creation of an online \u201cAtlas of Hate\u201d that has mapped Poland\u2019s anti-LGBT resolutions told broadcaster TVN of their \u201crelief and satisfaction\u201d at \u0141a\u0144cut\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThanks to the efforts of many people, groups and communities, over a hundred discriminatory anti-LGBT resolutions and family charters have disappeared from Poland,\u201d said Paulina Paj\u0105k. \u201cThese resolutions were an extreme manifestation of systemic discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very glad that this stage is coming to an end,\u201d added Jakub Gawron. \u201cBut that does not change the fact that these resolutions should not have been passed at all.\u201d\n\nGawron also noted the important role the EU had played in bringing about the repeal of all the resolutions by prohibiting financing of projects involving local authorities that adopt discriminatory resolutions.\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, the European Commission\u00a0[launched legal proceedings against Poland](\u00a0due to its anti-LGBT resolutions, which it argued \u201cmay violate EU law regarding non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation\u201d.\n\nSoon after, Brussels\u00a0[\u201cput on hold\u201d funding for Polish regions](\u00a0that had passed such resolutions, who were informed that \u201cdeclaring LGBTIQ-free/unwelcome territories\u2026constitutes an action that is against the values set out in the Treaty on European Union\u201d.\n\nThe EEA and Norway Grants programme, which is separate from the EU and provides funds to Polish local authorities, also\u00a0[announced that it would not finance projects](\u00a0run by places that have passed anti-LGBT+ resolutions.\n\n\n\nMost of the resolutions were passed with the support of the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which led Poland\u2019s national government at the time.\n\nDuring PiS\u2019s time in power, it led a\u00a0[vociferous campaign](\u00a0against what it called \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d and \u201cgender ideology\u201d.
