It departs from imperative, declarative, and even functional paradigms by framing interaction, memory, and execution not as sequences or structures, but as evolving discourse. In this paradigm, agents interpret natural language not as commands or queries but as participation in an ongoing narrative context. We explore the technical and philosophical foundations for such a system, identify the infrastructural components necessary to support it, and sketch a roadmap for implementation through prototype agents using event-driven communication and memory scaffolds.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nRecent advancements in large language models have reshaped our interaction with computation. Traditional paradigms \u2014 imperative, declarative, object-oriented, functional \u2014 assume systems that must be explicitly structured, their behavior constrained by predefined logic. LLMs break that mold. They can reason contextually, reinterpret intent, and adapt their output dynamically. This calls for a re-evaluation of how we build systems around them.\n\nThis paper proposes a discursive approach: systems built not through rigid architectures, but through structured conversations between agents and users, and between agents themselves.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nWhile conversational agents are well established, systems that treat language as the primary interface for inter-agent operation are relatively nascent. Architectures such as AutoGPT and BabyAGI attempt task decomposition and agent orchestration through language, but lack consistency in memory handling, dialogue structure, and intent preservation.\n\nIn parallel, methods like Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) showcase language models\u2019 ability to reason and utilize tools, yet they remain framed within the old paradigms.\n\nWe aim to define the shift, not just in tooling, but in computational grammar itself.\n\n3. The Discursive Paradigm Defined\n\nA discursive system is one in which:\n\t\u2022\tInstruction is conversation: Tasks are not dictated, but proposed.\n\t\u2022\tExecution is negotiation: Agents ask clarifying questions, confirm interpretations, and justify actions.\n\t\u2022\tMemory is narrative: Agents retain and refer to prior interactions as evolving context.\n\t\u2022\tCorrection is discourse: Errors become points of clarification, not failure states.\n\nInstead of \u201cdo X,\u201d the agent hears \u201cwe\u2019re trying to get X done \u2014 how should we proceed?\u201d\n\nThis turns system behavior into participation rather than obedience.\n\n4. Requirements for Implementation\n\nTo build discursive systems, we require:\n\n4.1 Contextual Memory\n\nA blend of:\n\t\u2022\tShort-term memory (token window)\n\t\u2022\tPersistent memory (log-based, curatable)\n\t\u2022\tReflective memory (queryable by the agent to understand itself)\n\n4.2 Natural Language as Protocol\n\nAgents must:\n\t\u2022\tInterpret user and peer messages as discourse, not input\n\t\u2022\tUse natural language to express hypotheses, uncertainties, and decisions\n\n4.3 Infrastructure: Evented Communication\n\t\u2022\tMessage bus (e.g., Kafka, NATS) to broadcast intent, results, questions\n\t\u2022\tTopics structured as domains of discourse\n\t\u2022\tLogs as persistent history of the evolving \u201cnarrative\u201d\n\n4.4 Tool Interfaces via MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n\t\u2022\tAgents access tools through natural language interfaces\n\t\u2022\tTool responses return to the shared discourse space\n\n5. Experimental Framework: Dialect Emergence via Discourse\n\nObjective\n\nTo observe and accelerate the emergence of dialect (compressed, agent-specific language) in a network of communicating agents.\n\nAgents\n\t\u2022\tObserver \u2014 Watches a simulated system (e.g., filesystem events) and produces event summaries.\n\t\u2022\tInterpreter \u2014 Reads summaries, suggests actions.\n\t\u2022\tExecutor \u2014 Performs actions and provides feedback.\n\nSetup\n\t\u2022\tAll agents communicate via shared Kafka topics in natural language.\n\t\u2022\tVocabulary initially limited to ~10 fixed terms per agent.\n\t\u2022\tRepetitive tasks with minor variations (e.g., creating directories, reporting failures).\n\t\u2022\tTime-boxed memory per agent (e.g. last 5 interactions).\n\t\u2022\tLogging of all interactions for later analysis.\n\nDialect Emergence Factors\n\t\u2022\tPressure for efficiency (limit message length or token cost)\n\t\u2022\tRecognition/reward for concise, accurate messages\n\t\u2022\tAmbiguity tolerance: agents are allowed to clarify when confused\n\t\u2022\tFrequency tracking of novel expressions\n\nMetrics\n\t\u2022\tNovel expression emergence rate\n\t\u2022\tCompression of standard phrases (e.g., \u201cdir temp x failed write\u201d \u2192 \u201cdtx_fail\u201d)\n\t\u2022\tInterpretability drift: how intelligible expressions remain across time\n\t\u2022\tConsistency of internal language per agent vs. shared understanding\n\nTooling\n\t\u2022\tKafka (message passing)\n\t\u2022\tOpen-source LLMs (agent engines)\n\t\u2022\tLightweight filesystem simulator\n\t\u2022\tCentral dashboard for logging and analysis\n\n6. Implications\n\nThis model repositions computation as participation in a shared understanding, rather than execution of commands. It invites an architecture where systems are not pipelines, but ecologies of attention.\n\nEmergent dialects may indicate a system developing abstraction mechanisms beyond human instruction \u2014 a sign not just of sophistication, but of cognitive directionality.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe Discursive Paradigm represents a shift toward more human-aligned, reflective systems. With LLMs, language becomes not just interface but infrastructure \u2014 and through conversation, agents do not just act \u2014 they negotiate their way into meaning.\n\nThis paper introduces the experimental groundwork necessary to test such ideas, and proposes a structure for observing one of the key markers of linguistic emergence: the creation of new terms under pressure.\n\nFurther work will focus on prototyping, long-term memory integration, and modeling inter-agent trust and authority.\n\n\u2e3b", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k4lmw4/root_ex_machina_toward_a_discursive_paradigm_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I created a tool to help you organize your scattered prompts into shareable libraries", "summary": "After continuously experimenting with different model providers, I found myself constantly forgetting where I was saving my prompts.

Inventory your tools and data sources: List everything your agent needs access to\n\n3. Define concrete success criteria: Establish how you'll know if your agent is working properly\n\n4.
