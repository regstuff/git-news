Since I have been writing about beer on my blog, I realized that beer was one of the first manufactured products, one of the earliest types of taxation and salaries. Right up until World War 1, both the U.S. and England raised over 20% of the state revenue from beer tax alone. But the other big contributions of beer brewing that often go unnoticed is to the world economy and [**science**](\n\n## 1. Money. It's a hit.\n\nGiven the staggering 192 billion liters of [**beer** ]( worldwide in 2022, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to assume that someone, somewhere is making a significant profit. While it might seem logical to think that brewing companies are the main beneficiaries, the truth is more complex. Revenue flows through the entire supply chain, encompassing all the products and services provided to the brewing companies, as well as those directed toward consumers.\n\n## 2. Jobs For Everyone!\n\nThe substantial gross domestic product generated by the global brewing industry does more than just translate into economic figures; it drives significant employment. Estimates from 2019 indicate that the industry supports about 23 million jobs [**worldwide**]( This is more than the entire workforce of [**Canada**]( which stands at an estimated 20.4 million, and is on par with Italy's employed population of approximately 23.7 million. This highlights not only the economic impact of the brewing industry but its vital role in job creation globally.\n\n## 3. Fighting the Germs!\n\nIf you are reading this, you've already heard a thousand times that water was unsafe in ancient times, so naturally people of all times have preferred some alcohol in their drink to water full of nasty germs! Well, that may be a bit exaggerated (making beer is a LOT of work!) [**beer** ]( have certainly been a preference in any large-scale human settlement.\n\n**Let's dive into this a bit.** One of the lesser-known benefits of the brewing process is its inherent ability to inhibit microbial spoilage, thanks to a combination of factors. These include the elevated temperatures during [**wort** ]( the antimicrobial properties of hops, the dominance of yeast during fermentation that outcompetes other microbes, as well as the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide and alcohol, and the acidic nature of wort and beer.\n\nTogether, these elements help purify the water used in brewing. For example, with moderate alcohol levels (over 4% ABV), pathogens like E.coli and Salmonella are unable to thrive in beer. This purifying effect has been utilized for centuries to provide a safe, drinkable alternative to water, which may otherwise have dubious purity.\n\n## 4. T-Student Method : a key method for clinical trials\n\nNow you are thinking: come on, there is no way beer ever saved someone from cancer. Alcohol - a natural poison - certainly never *saved* anybody. But the scientific methods for quality control bled over science all over the world. Here is an example: When testing new medicines, it's really important to figure out if the drug actually works differently compared to a dummy pill, known as a placebo, given to another group. The go-to method for making this comparison is something called the Student\u2019s T-test. And here's a fun fact: this method didn't come from a lab or a medical study; it actually came from the Guinness Brewing Company!\n\n## 5. Water Safety\n\nDuring the 1870s, France faced issues with its wine and beer\u2014not due to poor quality, but because the products spoiled quickly, a problem we'd now refer to as poor shelf flavor stability. This issue significantly impacted their ability to be transported to export markets, resulting in considerable financial losses. To address this, France called upon the esteemed Louis Pasteur.\n\nPasteur was ideally suited for the challenge, bringing with him his recently developed germ theory. He demonstrated, contrary to the prevailing beliefs of the time, that food and beverages spoiled and fermented due to contamination with germs (bacteria and yeast), which were invisible to the naked eye, and not because of any 'spontaneous' reaction.\n\n## 6. Hop against Cancer\n\nWhere would we be without [**hops**]( Well, for one thing, we might still be in the Middle Ages. The widespread use of hops to impart bitterness and aroma in brewing only began to take hold in the 13th century. Beyond their role in brewing, however, hops have also opened the door to a potential cancer treatment.   \n\n\n[**Xanthohumol**]( (XN), a component found in female hop cones, has been researched over the past 20 years as a potential cancer treatment. Initially discovered in 1913 by Power and his team who were studying hops for their brewing qualities, XN is now extracted using CO2, a method preferred for its efficiency. The anti-cancer potential of XN lies in its ability to induce apoptosis, a programmed cell death process that cancer cells can often bypass. Despite its promising effects in inhibiting cancer cell growth, XN has a drawback: it metabolizes into 8-PN, a phytoestrogen that might stimulate the growth of some cancerous tumors. Recent studies, however, are exploring synthesized derivatives of XN that could induce apoptosis without converting to 8-PN, offering hope for safer cancer treatment options.\n\n# 7. Yeast against aging?  \n\nYeast, traditionally used in brewing and baking, has only been intentionally utilized for fermentation since the 19th century, after significant discoveries by scientists like Pasteur and Hansen. These researchers not only identified yeast as the key fermenting agent but also [**isolated**]( specific beneficial strains, enhancing brewing techniques. Beyond its brewing role, for the last 50 years, yeast has served as a critical model organism in studying human aging, thanks to its well-understood molecular structure and genetic processes. The sequencing of its genome in 1996 has proven especially valuable, as many genetic insights apply directly to human cells. Additionally, yeast's simplicity, rapid growth, and short lifespan make it an ideal subject for fast-paced genetic experiments in aging research, contributing to significant scientific advancements.
