The man was a legendary drinker and spent a copious amount of time partying with companions during his great expedition to the East.\n\nProfessor John Maxwell O\u2019Brien of Queen\u2019s College, City University, New York, [concluded]( that Alexander frequently turned to the bottle to dilute his feelings of inferiority and anxiety. This is the only historian I\u2019ve found who refers to Alexander as an alcoholic: classical authors tend to want to defend Alexander the Great by saying that there is no definitive proof. On the other hand, you have to give Caesar what he deserves. In Macedonia, everyone drank wine, especially at banquets in the capital, Pella.\n\nAfter hunting and training, the banquet is a veritable institution. It\u2019s not a 5 \u00e0 7 like we poor moderns. A proper banquet can last three days. It\u2019s an eloquence contest, an important morale-boosting party, a kind of carnival where people say things they wouldn\u2019t otherwise say, AND it\u2019s also a drinking party. Being drunk is not only allowed, it\u2019s encouraged. In fact, in the eyes of this macho bunch, the problem isn\u2019t so much being drunk as looking drunk.\n\n# A Fatal Drunken Fight\n\nAn evening of drinking ended tragically when Alexander shot through and through one of his generals, Cleitos. Cleitos was one of Alexander\u2019s closest and most loyal officers, often referred to as Cleitos the Black because of his dark skin.\n\nThe incident took place at a banquet in Samarkand, Sogdiana (now Uzbekistan). Alexander and his generals were celebrating their recent victories in the region. The atmosphere was festive and the alcohol flowed freely. Over the course of the evening, the men began to discuss Alexander\u2019s achievements and the importance of his command.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, Cleitos criticized some of Alexander\u2019s decisions, notably his tendency to adopt Persian customs, which had been frowned upon by some Macedonians.\n\nThe discussion quickly degenerated into a violent argument. Cleitos accused Alexander of favoring the Persians at the expense of his fellow Macedonians. In return, Alexander, intoxicated and irritated by the criticism, allegedly threw a javelin at Cleitos. The javelin mortally wounded him, killing him instantly.\n\n# The worst party in History\n\nHowever, the most shocking story is that of the funeral of his friend Calanus, an Indian sage who had accompanied the army for two years. On his death, Alexander the Great [organized]( contest \u201cto determine who could drink the greatest quantity of unmixed wine\u201d. According to Chares of Mytilene, 35 people died before midnight, and a further six from various complications in the days that followed.\n\nThe winner himself did not survive more than four days after the event. Promachos, who drank an impressive 13 liters of wine, received the prize. The wine was [Macedonian]( which means it was a strong spirit. For his efforts, Promachos received the prize, only to die three days later, also of alcohol poisoning. This means that perhaps all the competitors in the drinking festival at Calanus\u2019 funeral are dead.\n\n# How did Alexander the Great Die?\n\nOne evening in June, after drinking an entire amphora of undiluted wine, the so-called \u201cchalice of Heracles\u201d (over 5 liters of pure wine), Alexander suffered severe back pain. A sharp pain, as if a spear had pierced him, followed by nausea. Soon afterward, feeling better, he started drinking again. After a day of enforced rest and a cold-water bath to help cope with the fever that had taken hold of him in the meantime, Alexander attended a [symposium]( the Mediacs and got drunk in an attempt to quench his infernal thirst.\n\nIn the days that followed, with his temperature rising, he attempted to perform his royal duties, but on the 24th of the month of Desio (in the Macedonian calendar, this corresponds roughly to June 9), his condition worsened and he was bedridden. The following day, he first lost the ability to speak, then his consciousness, until the 28th of Desio, and finally died in the evening.\n\nAlexander the Great\u2019s death triggered typical reactions to the loss of a celebrity. People wept and shaved their heads, while the most devoted admirers starved themselves to death, at least according to the sources that have come down to us, all of which are likely to exaggerate the event for political reasons.\n\nAlexander, a brilliant general, a wise leader and at times [magnanimous]( towards his subjects and enemies alike, was a superstar of the Ancient World. However, his swift and tumultuous life was overshadowed by self-destruction, a sad reality shared by many celebrities throughout history. The world thus said farewell to Alexander the Great, an icon of antiquity marked by his self-destructive nature.\n\nMore on [Hoppy History](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1bo4yy7/did_alexander_the_great_die_of_bingedrinking/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ecuador's youngest mayor Brigitte Garc\u00eda shot dead", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68655323", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can an \u2708\ufe0f be flown by just one \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2708\ufe0f?

For example I got the sentence \"Kenntnisse von Vertriebsprinzipien, -prozessen, -verfahren und -tools\" and want to turn it into \"Kenntnisse von Vertriebsprinzipien, Vertriebsprozessen, Vertriebsverfahren und Vertriebstools\".\n\nMy eventual goal is to build a skilltree out of a list of 484 skills and their descriptions, but before turning the words into vectors I'm trying to \"standardize\" them as much as possible.\n\nThis example comes from the skill \"Strategische Vertriebsplanung\". That's also just a portion of the skill, I want to split it down into sections at a later point in time. The full description is \"Kenntnisse von Vertriebsprinzipien, -prozessen, -verfahren und -tools; F\u00e4higkeit, zukunftsorientierte Vertriebspl\u00e4ne zu entwickeln sowie Gesch\u00e4ftsstrategien zu unterst\u00fctzen, die das Verst\u00e4ndnis von neu entstehenden wie auch bereits vorhandenen Gesch\u00e4ftschancen und M\u00e4rkten widerspiegeln.\"\n\nSo far I built a Java program which makes a GATE corpus of the skills with the skillname as the document name and the skill description as the document content. The pipeline I made so far (which I'll probably heavily modify in the future) utilizes a unicode tokenizer, sentence splitter, tree tagger with a lemmatizer, gazetteer for the stopwords and a plugin for removing tokens according to the features of annotations (it takes the type, feature and a regular expression for the feature value and removes everything with said value).\n\nSo currently I got a corpus with Lemma and POS annotations, removed stopwords and removed punctuation (I used my removal plugin with the Lookup annotations made by the gazetter and POS-tags with the regex \"\\\\\\\\$.+\" for that).\n\nMy current problem is that the POS-tags are not that great. For example in the aforementioned sentence \"Vertriebsprinzipien\" gets \"NN\", \"prozessen\" gets \"ADJD\", \"verfahren\" gets \"VVFIN\" and \"tools\" \"NN\". The TreeTagger uses the STTS.\n\nThat's why I want to modify the sentence like this and maybe use a RNN-Tagger or something else later.\n\nSo far I tried to use regular expressions, a POS+Lemma based approach, syllable tokens and ngrams. Apart from GATE I tried approaches with nltk, spaCy and syllapy.\n\nHow can I rebuild the sentence like this?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1bo7svi/rebuilding_german_compound_words/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Between 70-45,000 years ago, the Persian Plateau served as a hub for humans after their initial dispersal from Africa", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46161-7?utm_campaign=website&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=nautilus-newsletter", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Neo-Nazi who inspired Edward Norton\u2019s \u2018American History X\u2019 skinhead is now an observant Jew thanks to DNA discovery", "summary": "Can't think of anything more uplifting.", "link": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/neo-nazi-who-inspired-edward-norton-s-american-history-x-skinhead-is-now-an-observant-jew-thanks-to-dna-discovery/ar-BB1kxLvq", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France will soon be able to deliver 78 Caesar howitzers to Ukraine and will boost its supply of shells to meet Kyiv's urgent needs for ammunition to fight Russia's full-scale invasion", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/france-soon-deliver-78-howitzers-153152837.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why BlackRock\u2019s C.E.O.
