Both of them deny wrongdoing.\n\nThe development is the latest move by the current authorities to investigate the use of Pegasus under PiS, which has been accused of unlawfully purchasing the spyware and of employing it spy on political opponents rather than genuine criminal suspects.\n\nOn Wednesday, prosecutors announced charges against Piotr Pogonowski, who headed the Internal Security Agency (ABW) from 2016 to 2022, and Maciej Materka, who led the Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) from 2018 to 2022.\n\nBoth of them are accused of failing to fulfil their duties by allowing the use of Pegasus despite knowing that it did not have the required security accreditation and without verifying whether the system ensured the proper security classification of information processed by it.\n\nThis meant that they failed to ensure the proper conduct of operational and reconnaissance activities, as required by law, as well as the protection of classified information. Their actions were thereby \u201cto the detriment of the public interest\u201d, say prosecutors.\n\nIf found guilty of abusing their powers, each of the suspects could face up to three years in prison.\n\nIn a statement on social media, Materka denied the accusations against him and said that, as head of the SKW, \u201cit was my duty to provide officers with the necessary and best possible tools for the performance of their statutory tasks\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll operational activities conducted during my leadership at the SKW were undertaken solely on the basis of legally required decisions and court approvals,\u201d he added. Pogonski likewise issued a statement saying that the ABW under his leadership \u201calways complied with legal regulations\u201d.\n\nPogonski also aimed a shot at the current government, saying that, when he had led the agency, \u201cthe effectiveness of the security services was very high \u2013 for example, there were no shopping malls on fire, no train tracks being blown up, etc\u201d.\n\nThat was a reference to a series of incidents of Russian sabotage, including an\u00a0[arson attack on Warsaw\u2019s biggest shopping centre](\u00a0and\u00a0[sabotage of a rail line]( that have taken place in Poland since the current government replaced PiS in December 2023.\n\nThe PiS government, which approved the purchase of Pegasus in 2017, argued that it was a necessary tool to fight crime and ensure national security. But critics noted that it was used to\u00a0[surveil PiS\u2019s political opponents](\n\nSince replacing PiS in office, the current government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, has pledged to hold to account any officials involved in crimes relating to Pegasus.\n\nIn 2024, the justice minister announced that\u00a0[almost 600 people](\u00a0were targeted for surveillance using Pegasus, including some political\u00a0[opponents of PiS.](\u00a0Last year, Tusk himself\u00a0[revealed](\u00a0that his wife and daughter had been among those caught up in the surveillance.\n\nLast October, a former PiS deputy justice minister was\u00a0[indicted](\u00a0over his role in the alleged illegal purchase of Pegasus from its Israeli manufacturer. Days later, a former deputy head of the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA) was\u00a0[charged](\u00a0with unlawfully sharing material obtained using Pegasus.\n\n[**Olivier Sorgho**](\n\nOlivier Sorgho is senior editor at Notes from Poland, covering politics, business and society.
