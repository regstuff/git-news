But the government\u00a0[made them optional](\u00a0following a backlash from the Catholic church and conservative politicians, who criticised elements relating to sex education and gender.\n\nMany individual cities and regions have already released data on how many children have signed up for the subject, but on Friday the education ministry released the first full nationwide figures on participation.\n\nThey showed that 30% of all eligible pupils had signed up for the classes, which begin in the fourth grade of primary school.\n\nThe highest attendance was in primary schools (40.36%). By contrast, it was much lower in general secondary schools (10.08%), technical schools (7.78%), vocational schools (14.40%) and art schools (18.33%).\n\nAttendance is stronger in Poland\u2019s more liberal western provinces \u2013 with the highest figures in Wielkopolska (38.59%), Lubusz (38.31%) and Kuyavia-Pomerania (37.26%) \u2013 and weaker in the more conservative east, with the lowest figures in Podkarpackie\u00a0(17.19%), Podlaskie (21.53%) and Lublin (21.72%) provinces.\n\nAmong cities, Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski in western Poland reported the highest attendance at 35.66%, while Rzesz\u00f3w in the east reported the lowest at 14.49%.\n\nHowever, the subject that health education replaced, called education for family life (WD\u017b), which\u00a0[included elements of sex education]( was also only attended by a minority of pupils. Indeed, attendance at health education seems higher than it was for WD\u017b.\n\nIn 2022, attendance of WD\u017b in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland\u2019s third-largest city, was 32% in primary schools and 6% in secondary schools, reported broadcaster TVN at the time. Now, in the same city, 56% of primary school pupils and 8% in secondary schools have signed up for health education, according to\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*.\n\nLikewise, in the city of Szczecin, WD\u017b classes were attended by roughly 40% of primary school pupils and less than 5% of secondary school pupils in 2022, reported Radio Szczecin. Now, attendance of health education is 56% in primary schools and 11% in secondary schools, according to news website Interia.\n\nThe education ministry has appealed to parents to sign their children up for health education, saying that it helps\u00a0equip young people \u201cwith reliable knowledge and practical skills and attitudes that enable them to make informed health decisions and promote a healthy lifestyle\u201d.\n\nHowever, Poland\u2019s influential Catholic church has\u00a0[expressed opposition](\u00a0to the new subject, claiming that it includes elements that are \u201canti-family\u201d, \u201cgender destabilising\u201d and will \u201cmorally corrupt children\u201d. It appealed to parents not to allow their children to attend.\n\nThe right-wing opposition has also criticised health education, including opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki. In September, he\u00a0[revealed](\u00a0that he and his wife had decided to opt their teenage son out of the classes, which Nawrocki said \u201csmuggle ideology into schools\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, education ministry Barbara Nowacka condemned the \u201clies and manipulations\u201d about the subject that she said had been spread by the church and right-wing politicians. She reiterated her hope that the subject could in future be made compulsory\n\n[Studies](\u00a0and\u00a0[official data](\u00a0in recent years have pointed to a deterioration in the mental health of children and adolescents in Poland, including a growing number of suicide attempts.\n\nAfter the ministry published data on attendance of health education, student organisation Akcja Uczniowska renewed calls to make the subject compulsory.\n\nIts founder, high school student Pawe\u0142 Mrozek, lamented that \u201chealth education was politicised from the outset\u201d, not only by the opposition but also by government-aligned presidential candidate Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski during his campaign for this year\u2019s election, which\u00a0he lost to Nawrocki.\n\n\u201cRafa\u0142 Trzaskowski and his team decided to go all in to win the votes of conservative voters. Schoolchildren fell victim to this gamble. It is time to take responsibility for this, apologise and roll up our sleeves so that the fate of health education in the new school year is more optimistic, i.e. compulsory,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/15/less-than-third-of-polish-schoolchildren-join-new-health-classes-after-conservative-backlash/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mutirao: Brazil's Indigenous answer to the climate crisis", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/mutirao-the-brazilian-indigenous-concept-that-could-change-climate-talks/a-74734652", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Argentina: 'Huge' explosions rock industrial complex \u2013 DW \u2013 11/15/2025", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/argentina-huge-explosions-rock-industrial-complex/a-74756361", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Zelensky meets with Mitsotakis in Athens today, protests banned in the Greek capital", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.slobodenpecat.mk/en/zelenski-deneska-vo-atina-na-sredba-so-micotakis-zabraneti-protestite-vo-grchkata-prestolnina/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Abuse of \"zombie cigarettes\" on rise in southern Japan", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/64969", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Your Party in fresh trans row", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/11/16/your-party-in-fresh-trans-row-corbyn-zultana/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
