They include documents relating to protections granted by a series of popes, the oldest of which was issued by\u00a0Pope Innocent III to the Teutonic Order in 1215.\n\nOthers are signed by Polish kings, including a 1349 document in which Casimir III the Great marked the border with the Teutonic Order. Another, from 1422, is a copy of the Treaty of Melno, which ended a war the Teutonic Knights had fought against Poland and Lithuania.\n\nUntil the 18th century, the documents were stored in Wawel Castle in Krak\u00f3w, the seat of Polish kings and the country\u2019s former capital. Subsequently, they were transferred to Warsaw, where by the 20th century they were held in the Central Archives of Historical Records (AGAD).\n\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939, the collection became subject to the mass looting of valuable Polish historical and cultural collections carried out by the occupiers.\n\nThe parchments were formally handed over to Nazi Germany in December 1940 and transferred to\u00a0the Prussian State Archives in K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad in Russia) in January 1941. Later, they were moved to the Prussian Secret State Archives in Berlin.\n\nPoland first made efforts to secure their return in 1948, three years after the end of the war. Those were unsuccessful, as were further attempts in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nFinally, in 2022, Poland submitted a comprehensive restitution request for the first time, including documentation relating to the looting. Last year, the Polish government\u00a0[renewed its push](\u00a0for the documents to be returned.\n\nFinally, today, amid bilateral talks in Berlin between the Polish and German governments, culture minister\u00a0Marta Cienkowska announced that the parchments would be returned, calling it \u201ca historic day\u201d.\n\nShe also revealed that the head of a 14th-century sculpture of Saint James the Elder, which was stolen from Malbork Castle in Poland in 1957 and purchased for the collection of the Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg, will be handed back to Poland.\n\nSpeaking to the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily, Cienkowska called today\u2019s restitution decision \u201cthe most important since 1989\u201d.\n\nShe said that it was the current government\u2019s move to \u201crepair relations with our neighbours\u201d, which were often strained under the former Law and Justice (PiS) administration, \u201cthat has finally allowed us not only to return to dialogue but also to shift to an offensive on restitution\u201d.\n\nThe brutal Nazi-German occupation of Poland from 1939 to 1945 resulted in the deaths of millions of Polish citizens, the destruction of Polish cities, and also the looting and destruction of hundreds of thousands of artistic, historical and scientific items held in Polish collections.\n\nMany of them remain unaccounted for, with the culture ministry\u2019s\u00a0[public database](\u00a0of works it has identified as missing still containing around 70,000 items.\n\nWhen such objects are identified \u2013 for example, in the collections of museums, archives and galleries, or when they come up for sale at auction \u2013 the Polish government seeks their return.\n\nHowever, Poland has often expressed frustration at the difficulty of restituting items from Germany. In 2022, it\u00a0[appealed to UNESCO](\u00a0for help on the issue.\n\nToday,\u00a0Cienkowska said that she had received \u201ca guarantee\u201d from her German counterpart, Wolfram Weimer, \u201cthat the processing of our \\[restitution\\] applications will be expedited\u201d.\n\nAmong the looted items Poland is currently seeking the return of are historical documents held at the Berlin State Library and a\u00a0[ring](\u00a0that belonged to a 16th-century Polish king, Sigismund I the Old.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/01/germany-agrees-to-return-medieval-documents-looted-by-the-nazis-to-poland/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Report says world's biggest arms producers increased revenue by 5.9% last year to record level", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/global-arms-sales-2024-sipri-ukraine-gaza-3bd387ecc7523004140d2fcaa681ae0e", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish city \u015awidnica seeks to begin recognising foreign same-sex marriages following EU ruling", "summary": "\u015awidnica has become the first Polish city to announce that it intends to begin entering same-sex marriages concluded abroad into the official state registry, in line with a ruling issued last week by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) requiring Poland to recognise such unions.\n\nHowever, the city\u2019s mayor admits that they cannot do so until the national government updates the registry system, which currently only recognises marriages between a man and a woman. The digital affairs ministry says it will soon complete an assessment of how this can be done, but political hurdles remain.\n\nOn 25 November, the CJEU\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0on a case brought by two Polish men who had married in Germany but found their efforts to have their union recognised in Poland rejected by the registry office and courts because Poland\u2019s constitution refers to marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\nThe CJEU deemed that this infringed the freedom to move and reside within the EU as well as the right to respect for private and family life. It ordered Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe government has\u00a0[said that it will comply](\u00a0with the ruling, but needs time to work on implementation.\n\nHowever, on Friday, the mayor of \u015awidnica, a city of 55,000 in southwestern Poland, announced that they want to begin transcribing marriage certificates of same-sex couples into the Polish registry even before the government acts.\n\n\u201cSwidnica is a beautiful, open city that rescues people from various oppressions and solves various problems,\u201d Beata Moskal-S\u0142aniewska told broadcaster Tok FM. This year, her city held its first ever Diversity Day, which included local LGBT+ groups.\n\n\u201cFor same-sex couples, a marriage transcription \\[into the Polish registry\\] is not just a formality, but also a sense of security, the fulfilment of dreams and recognition of their relationship in a fully civilised manner,\u201d she added.\n\nThe mayor admitted, though, that \u201cthere is just one problem\u201d. When entering the names of couples into the digital registry, their PESELs \u2013 Polish identification numbers \u2013 are required. But those numbers identify a person as male or female.\n\n\u201cIf we enter a PESEL number in the \u2018female\u2019 field that the system recognises as male, it simply won\u2019t let the entry through,\u201d\u00a0Moskal-S\u0142aniewska\u00a0told news website OKO.press. And, currently, marriages can only be entered into the system if they are between a man and a woman.\n\nThe mayor said that she would meet with digital affairs minister Krzysztof Gawkowski in an attempt to resolve the issue. Both politicians hail from The Left (Lewica), which is part of Poland\u2019s ruling coalition.\n\nAsked by Tok FM about the issue on Friday, deputy digital affairs minister Dariusz Standerski said that they were already \u201ccarrying out analyses on how to implement this judgment in accordance with the CJEU\u2019s line\u201d and \u201cwill have the results in the coming days\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of a week, two weeks at most,\u201d he added. \u201cWe certainly won\u2019t delay it. Because the case is important\u2026 And we pay attention to what the EU courts say and abide by those rulings.\u201d\n\nHowever, Standerski also noted that the state IT systems \u201coperate within the boundaries and on the basis of the law\u201d. So, \u201cto change something in the system, you first need to change something in the law\u201d. He said that any solution would have to be coordinated with the interior and foreign ministries.\n\nSome have argued that the CJEU\u2019s ruling will be difficult to implement because Poland\u2019s constitution defines marriage as being between a man and a woman. Others, however, say that it does not preclude the recognition of same-sex marriages.\n\nArticle 18 of the constitution states: \u201cMarriage, being a union of a man and a woman, as well as the family, motherhood and parenthood, shall be placed under the protection and care of the Republic of Poland\u201d.\n\nThe issue is highly politically charged, with many in Poland opposed both to the recognition of same-sex marriages and the idea that this can be imposed on the country by the EU.\n\nWhile The Left is a strong supporter of LGBT+ rights, including recognising same-sex relationships, more conservative elements of the ruling coalition, especially the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), are likely to be less enthusiastic about complying with the CJEU\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine trying to create regulations that would implement a judgement that doesn\u2019t fully respect the provisions of the constitution,\u201d said energy minister Mi\u0142osz Motyka, a member of PSL, quoted by the Interia news website.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk, leader of the centrist Civic Coalition (KO) party, has so far been non-committal on how his government will respond to the CJEU ruling.\n\nAt a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he said that \u201cwe will, of course, respect the verdicts and judgements of European courts\u201d. But he added that \u201cthe EU cannot impose anything on us on this issue\u201d and \u201cwherever matters must be decided by the nation state and national law, we will adhere to this principle\u201d.\n\nThe issue is also complicated by the fact that any legislative change must be approved by President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party and is ardently opposed to the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nToday, PiS deputy leader and former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki condemned the CJEU ruling. \u201cPoland cannot be a puppet in the hands of CJEU judges,\u201d he declared, quoted by the\u00a0*Do Rzeczy*\u00a0weekly.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely do not consent to Polish law being changed in any way as a result of this CJEU ruling,\u201d Morawiecki continued. \u201cLet us defend Polish families, defend Polish children, defend Polish traditions against any external interference. Sovereignty is supreme in Polish law. I would die for sovereignty.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is also possible that the government could find non-legislative ways to implement the ruling, thereby avoiding the need for the issue to go through parliament and meet an almost-certain veto from Nawrocki.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/01/polish-city-seeks-to-begin-recognising-foreign-same-sex-marriages-following-eu-ruling/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why Iran is making surprising overtures to America", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/11/27/why-iran-is-making-surprising-overtures-to-america", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shock in Cameroon as 74-year-old opposition firebrand dies in detention", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9204y4w5o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cameroon Opposition leader Tchiroma Bakary flees to Gambia after contested election", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cameroon-opposition-leader-tchiroma-bakary-flees-to-gambia-after-contested-election/article70317304.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane dies in detention", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/12/cameroonian-opposition-figure-anicet-ekane-dies-in-detention/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jihadists execute aid worker abducted in Nigeria", "summary": "&gt;\u201cThe armed group holding captive an employee of Action Against Hunger (ACF), two drivers and three health ministry personnel, have executed a hostage,\u201d the Paris-based organisation said in a statement.\n\n&gt;The announcement of the latest execution comes after the army last week shut down ACF offices in northeast Nigeria, accusing the organisation of supplying \u201cfood and drugs\u201d to the jihadists.\n\nImagine having both the Jihadists and the Government's military both accusing you of supporting the other side.", "link": "http://www.oyibosonline.com/jihadists-execute-aid-worker-abducted-in-nigeria/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UN envoy Albanese accused of justifying violence against journalists", "summary": "", "link": "https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/12/in-italy-un-envoy-albanese-accused-of-justifying-violence-against-journalists/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
