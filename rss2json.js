Only one couple would rent to him in 1939: Gus and Emma Thompson, one of the few Black families that owned a home in Coronado. After Gus \u2014 a former enslaved person \u2014 died, Emma sold the house to Dong.\n\nTo the Dongs, the Thompsons\u2019 decision \u2014 an unprompted gesture of solidarity across two families\u2019 experiences of discrimination in the United States \u2014 paved the way for their American Dream. And it deserved a response, even decades later.\n\nThe Dongs are now selling their Coronado home and donating about two-thirds of the proceeds \u2014 likely to be around $5 million \u2014 to a resource center for Black students at San Diego State University, which they asked to rename in honor of Gus and Emma Thompson.\n\n\u2026Coronado\u2019s history was marked \u2014 as it was in neighborhoods across the country \u2014 by the emergence of racially restrictive housing covenants that forbade homes from being sold or leased to minorities in the early 20th century. Among the few Black families that remained in Coronado were Gus and Emma Thompson, entrepreneurs who had purchased land in the 1890s and built a home in the city before the racist policies took hold.\n\n\u2026Lloyd Dong Sr., a second-generation Chinese American from Bakersfield, Calif., looked for a home to rent in Coronado so he could avoid the long commute back to San Diego each night. He was rejected at every turn, struggling in the face of both the city\u2019s housing covenants and the national swell of anti-Asian sentiment that followed the Immigration Act of 1924, which cut off Asian immigration into the United States.\n\nIn Dong, the Thompsons saw another person of color trying to find a foothold in Coronado. They opened their doors.\n\nRon Dong was a toddler at the time and said he doesn\u2019t remember much about the Thompsons. But their modest three-bedroom house on a leafy street near the center of Coronado, which the Dongs began renting in 1939 before buying from the Thompsons in 1955, brought Ron and his siblings a comfortable childhood in the affluent town...\n\nThe Thompsons \u2018enabled the Dong family to survive and thrive\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2026Decades later, as California and other states grapple with the question of whether and how current generations of Black Americans should be compensated for past racial injustices, they saw an opportunity to pay their gift forward\u2026\n\n\u2018You know, there\u2019s a big thing about reparations now,\u201d Janice Dong said. \u201cThis is a personal reparation. \u2026 It isn\u2019t any big governmental thing.
