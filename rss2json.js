I am definitely dead set on pursuing archaeology, but the academic part of it is most appealing to me. I want to be a professor ultimately. In other subjects, it would be normal and expected to jump straight in to a masters or PhD program. However, with archaeology's uniqueness as a profession I've heard of people taking many different paths to get to where they are. I've talked to quite a few grad students, who mostly tell me they did CRM work before going to grad school or are currently doing it while attending school. Many professors did not, but tell me it's not a bad idea to get professional experience because academia is hard to get in to.\n\nMy main gripes with CRM is that 1. I don't have a car and don't want a car, and 2. I'm not particularly interested in American indigenous archaeology. \n\nI want to hear more opinions on other's experiences with and without CRM experience.
