There's a significant amount to grasp regarding implementation and development practices, ranging from selecting the appropriate AI models for the specific use case to organizing data effectively to obtain the desired insights. While tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex exist to simplify the prototype design process, there has yet to be an accessible, ready-to-use open-source RAG template that incorporates best practices and offers modular support, allowing anyone to quickly and easily utilize it.  \nTrueFoundry has recently introduced a new open-source framework called [Cognita]( which utilizes Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to simplify the transition by providing robust, scalable solutions for deploying AI applications. AI development often begins in experimental environments such as Jupyter notebooks, which are useful for prototyping but not well-suited for production environments. However, Cognita aims to bridge this gap. Developed on top of Langchain and LlamaIndex, Cognita offers a structured and modular approach to AI application development. Each component of the RAG, from data handling to model deployment, is designed to be modular, API-driven, and extendable.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cetz9h/how_to_quickly_build_and_deploy_scalable/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tagging xml", "summary": "I understand there is software designed for producing/editing xml, but I have not shelled out to become familiar with it. I\u2019m looking at situations where you have xml markup of documents and you\u2019d like to tag it up more as an aid to future extraction processes.\n\nOk, so basic regex will do some things but it seems a natural want is to combine regex with xpath. \u201cThis pattern, where it appears in this path, wrap it thus.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a nice thought, but then you ask what happens if the path returns parent elements. Applying regex to tagged material risks the structure, and I\u2019m using xpath to avoid that. From there we could say that a basic editing process limits itself to text nodes.  It seems clear: we dial in on text nodes and then we should be free to tag a pattern we find.\n\nThen however you may need to wrap chunks in a new parent element. You might say this should be available for a single element\u2019s inner or outer content, but maybe also for contiguous siblings. Identifying and grouping contiguous siblings is dicey and, as I understand, versions of xslt after 1.0 enhanced grouping functionality.  If you can group nodes and interpolate tags into text nodes you might be in good shape.  We don\u2019t mix the two, so grouping is for whole nodes only.  A last piece, intuitively, is to \u201cuntag\u201d: throw out a tag but keep the content.\n\nThis gets to the topic of xslt. The main mental hump I see is that it feels clunky. Single responsibility principle?  Modularity? An xslt sheet seems to expect a full script for the whole transform, like an elegant piece of joinery. It may be the most efficient process in the end but that is not necessarily what I need.\n\nI am wondering then what tools are recommended for this kind of process, by those who really focus on it?
