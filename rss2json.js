I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I researched potential job paths, and found out some linguistics experts work in AI (particularly NLP). This sounded super exciting to me, so I managed to find an AI company that was running a grad scheme where they hired promising grads (without requiring CS degrees) for an analytics position, with the promise of moving to another team in the future. I moved to the AI team two years ago, where I've mostly been training intent classification models with Pytorch/HF Transformers, as well as some sentiment analysis stuff. I also have some genAI experience (mostly for machine translation and benchmarking against our 'old school' solutions).\n\nI've been very actively looking for a new job since March and to say I've been struggling is an understatement. I have barely seen any traditional NLP jobs like TTS/STT, text classification etc, and even when I do apply, the market seems so saturated with senior applicants that I get rejection after rejection. The only jobs that recruiters reach out to me about ate 'AI Engineer' kind of positions, and every time I see those I want to disintegrate. I personally really, REALLY dislike working on genAI - I feel like unless you're a researcher working on the algorithms, it's more of a programming job with calling genAI APIs and some prompting. I do not enjoy coding nearly as much as I do working with data, preprocessing datasets, learning about and applying ML techniques, and evaluating models.\n\nI also enjoy research, but nowhere wants to hire someone without a PhD or at the very least a Masters for a research position (and as I'm not a UK national, an ML Masters would cost me 30-40k for a year, which I cannot afford). I've even tried doing some MLOps courses, but didn't particularly enjoy it. I've considered moving to non-language data science (predictive modelling etc), but it's been taking a while upskilling in that area, and recruiters don't seem interested in the fact I have NLP machine learning experience, they want stuff like time series and financial/energy/health data experience.\n\nI just feel so defeated and hopeless. I felt so optimistic 4 years ago, excited for a future when I can shift my linguistics skills into creating AI-driven data insights. Now it feels like my NLP/linguistics background is a curse, as with genAI becoming the new coolest NLP thing, I only seem qualified for the jobs that I hate. I feel like I wasted the past 4 years chasing a doomed dream, and now I'm stuck with skills that no one seems to see as transferrable to other ML/DS jobs. So I guess my question is - is there still any demand for non-genAI NLP jobs? Should I hold onto this dream until the job market improves/genAI hype dies down? Or is traditional NLP dead and I should give up and change careers? I genuinely fell in love with machine learning and don't want to give up but I can't keep going like this anymore. I don't mind having the occasional genAI project, but I'd want the job to only have elements of it at most, not be an 'AI Engineer' or 'Prompt engineer'.\n\n(PS: Yes, I am 100% burnt out.)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1mmubob/nongenai_nlp_jobs_in_the_current_market/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The EU (still) wants to scan your private messages and photos.", "summary": "\n\n\nWould you let the mailman read your letter before you seal it?\n\nThat is exactly what the EU\u2019s \u201cChat Control\u201d would do.
