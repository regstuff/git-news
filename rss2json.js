I won\u2019t stop trying to learn..but I\u2019m struggling. I\u2019d love to be able to see if she\u2019s ok. To thank her, (she keeps giving us food) and to plan family trips together. Also, i think we\u2019re both a little shy. I\u2019m quite techie but am getting old, out of touch. Can anyone help? Maybe recommend a tool we can use to talk together? Without having to rely on my son\u2019s girlfriend, who is off to uni soon?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nagyvp/any_tips_on_tech_to_aid_me_to_converse_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Woman rescued from domestic violence after using hand signal at 7-Eleven", "summary": "", "link": "https://local12.com/news/nation-world/john-palumbi-woman-rescued-from-domestic-violence-after-using-hand-signal-at-7-eleven-cincinnati-dilemma-social-public-health-issue-education-learning-without-bail-nonverbal-communication-methods-suspicious-activity-discreet-law-enforcement-relationships", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mendik Tepe, Believed to Pre-Date G\u00f6beklitepe, Unearthed in \u015eanl\u0131urfa", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.needsomefun.net/mendik-tepe-believed-to-pre-date-gobeklitepe-unearthed-in-sanliurfa/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The meteoric rise of Bahadur Shah attracts the attention of Mughal emperor Humayun.
