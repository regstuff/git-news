However, I'm not sure where to talk about this because I'm mostly interested in the techniques that are less than ethical and I want to only talk about how they work and how to counteract them but not instruct anyone in these techniques.\n\nIt's not neuro-linguistic programming though but a system that combines algorithmic automatisation, stochastics, psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics. Basically, it's structured as a form of \"hacking\" but instead of using software exploits to install agents on servers, it's using psychological exploits to inject stuff into the subconscious processing and then deleting the memory of that moment's awareness. It's also not programming sentences to have an effect but it uses impulses to trigger core instincts that overwrite all higher functions for a short moment and to enlarge that window of opportunity by shooting impulses to basically set the mind into a stun lock that makes it impossible for the target to process anything critically and they jump into blind obedience to the nearest member of the species because that's the safest thing to do in a natural setting when one human suddenly loses their ability to think for whichever reason. This way, just to name one example, people can be made to do specific things until those become their own Automatismus that they execute regularly without still thinking about it. More importantly, this approach can paralyse people at a global scale. I think that it's also being used since at least 2020 to keep people from reacting as we are confronted with all the different ways we thought the world could end coming and going while life prevails. It's very interesting stuff in my opinion, just maybe a bit dangerous to share all too openly?\n\nSo, my primary question is: Does anyone know a space to talk about these advanced techniques with people who can handle that understanding responsibly and who also already have a comparable level of insight?\n\nOtherwise, I guess, another question could be what you consider a sensible line to draw. Like normally, I would draw that line at revealing stuff that can strip people of their free will and do major harm but then, I see these techniques being used on a global scale already, anyways. And not by people who make a very reliable or even just halfway safe impression... Is it just me or is this whole topic really tricky?

It has also called for a new law protecting the rights of Christians, saying they \u201care today the most persecuted social group\u201d.\n\n\u201cCharlie Kirk was a symbolic figure for many young people; he was a representative of young conservatives, fighting for the freedom of speech, religious freedom, freedom of debate, and for that he was murdered,\u201d said PiS MP and former justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro on Wednesday.\n\nZiobro said that Tyler Robinson, who has been charged with killing Kirk, \u201cidentified with LGBT activists\u201d and that PiS \u201cwants to oppose leftist tendencies and demands that, through violence, want to impose their own views\u201d.\n\nZiobro\u2019s party colleague, Dariusz Matecki, announced that they were submitting a request to Prime Minister Donald Tusk \u201cdemanding that we follow the example of the United States and Hungary, and that Poland request the European Union to recognise Antifa as a terrorist organisation\u201d.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump signed an executive order designating Antifa \u2013 a loose and decentralised radical anti-fascist and anti-racist movement \u2013 as a domestic terrorist organisation. He took that action after promising to clamp down on left-wing groups in the wake of Kirk\u2019s murder.\n\nMeanwhile, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the right-wing prime minister of Hungary, said that his country would also seek to \u201cfollow the American example\u201d and designate Antifa a terrorist organisation. The EU has a\u00a0[joint terrorist list](\u00a0of individuals and organisations against whom it applies sanctions and restrictions.\n\nIn Poland,\u00a0[anti-fascist events](\u00a0are often held \u2013 for example, counter-marches organised in response to nationalist events. However, the term \u201cAntifa\u201d itself is not often used by such groups to describe themselves.\n\n\n\nZiobro also announced that PiS would seek to resurrect a proposed law \u201con the defence of Christians\u201d in Poland. The legislation was previously\u00a0[presented to parliament in 2022]( when PiS was in power, and received backing at the time from Ziobro, who was then justice minister.\n\nAmong its provisions were prison sentences of up to two years for anyone who \u201cpublicly insults or ridicules the church, an object of worship, or a place intended for the public performance of religious rites\u201d. The legislation would also have introduced protections from prosecution for speech expressing religious beliefs.\n\nHowever, by the time the bill finally made its way to a parliamentary vote in 2024, PiS had lost power and been replaced by Tusk\u2019s more liberal ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right. The legislation was rejected by the government\u2019s majority in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, PiS MP Micha\u0142 W\u00f3jcik condemned the ruling coalition for \u201cthrowing into the trash a bill that was meant to protect Christians in Poland from attacks\u201d.\n\nMarcin Warcho\u0142, a former PiS justice minister, claimed that \u201cChristians are today the most persecuted social group\u201d and require special protection.
