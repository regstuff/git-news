Writing the perfect one-shot prompt like you\u2019re casting a spell misses the point. Most of the time, people aren\u2019t even clear on what they want the model to do.\n\nThe best results come from treating the model like a junior engineer you\u2019re walking through a problem with. You talk through the system. You lay out the data, the edge cases, the naming conventions, the flow. You get aligned before writing anything. Once the model understands the problem space, the code it generates is clean, correct, and ready to drop in.\n\nI just built a full HL7 results feed in a new application build this way. Controller, builder, data fetcher, segment appender, API endpoint. No copy-paste guessing. No rewrites. All security in place through industry standard best practices. We figured out the right structure together, mostly by promoting one another to ask questions to resolve ambiguity rather than write code, then implemented it piece by piece. It was faster and better than doing it alone. And we did it in a morning. This likely would have taken 3-5 days of human alone work before actually getting it to the test phase. It was flushed out and into end to end testing it before lunch.\n\nPrompt engineering as a magic trick is done. Use the model as a thinking partner instead. Get clear on the problem first, then let it help you solve it.\n\nSo what do we call this?  I got a couple of working titles. But the best ones that I\u2019ve come up with I think is Context Engineering or Prompt Elicitation. Because what we\u2019re talking about is the hybridization of requirements elicitation, prompt engineering, and fully establishing context (domain analysis/problem scope). Seemed like a fair title. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this. No I\u2019m not trying to sell you anything.

But the experience of the users vary greatly depending on what they are trying to do: \n\n-Simple chatting with LLMs: great. No complaints here. They select in a drop-down, start typing, done. Also websearch is good using bing.\n\n-Using image generation and voice features: not good. Images fail to generate more often than not (Gemini), stt somehow always rips the available capacity no matter what we configure (openai, azure), tts works great with azure voice.\n\n-using the workspace: many tried, most gave up. Document upload and processing fails often, even without a reason in the logs, even tho we distributed the load into different external databases and services (mistral OCR, postgres, openai embeddings).\n\n-the most complaints come about tool calling/ MCP. This seems like the least polished feature. First of all: MCPs don't work at all by design. They want you to tunnel those through open API using \"mcpo\". Which is fine for technical people, but Emma from accounting? She manages to paste a URL somewhere, but \"hey Emma, make sure you have uvx installed, then read the docs for mcpo and use it with our remote company MCP. Don't forget to do that every time you start your machine\". Emma nopes out. Luckily we have a different MCP to open API running. Okay, shouldn't be too hard now, should it? No, again not simply pasting a URL. There are 2 rows for parts of the URL for some reason, and  OWUI does not adhere to the openapi standard, they ignore the server addresses in the schema, instead they want the server that serves the .json also be the same machine that is the target of tool urls. Probably because mcpo works this way locally, and yes if you are a dev doing this locally is fine, but in an enterprise? \nThen when you have 2 tool servers with the same \"base\" address, only the first works. Mcpo compatibility I suppose, but openapi compatibility would be nicer.\nConfiguring toolservers as admin does not seem to work at all. It reads the name of the server, but no tools that work with configuring the same address in the users settings. \nAnd then there are \"tools\" in the workspace that can be scripted,but so far no one managed to make a working openapi to python converter to use tools this way. Maybe those tools only support one rest endpoint at a time. \n\nOverall, with enough external databases and services, you get a decent chatgpt clone minus the document processing that always works, but the usefulness is severely diminished by not having MCP and real openapi support.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1lbhjtt/my_experience_with_setting_up_owui_for_a_company/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Testing ChatDOC and NotebookLM on document-based research", "summary": "I tested different \"chat with PDF\" tools to streamline document-heavy research workflows. Two I\u2019ve spent the most time with are ChatDOC and NotebookLM. Both are designed for AI-assisted document Q&amp;A, but they\u2019re clearly optimized for different use cases. Thought I\u2019d share my early impressions and see how others are using these, especially for literature reviews, research extraction, or QA across structured/unstructured documents.\n\n\n\nWhat I liked about each:\n\n\\- NotebookLM\n\n1. Multimedia-friendly: It accepts PDFs, websites, Google Docs/Slides, YouTube URLs, and even audio files. It\u2019s one of the few tools that integrates video/audio natively.\n\n2. Notebook-based structure: Great for organizing documents into themes or projects. You can also tweak AI output style and summary length per notebook.\n\n3. Team collaboration: Built for shared knowledge work. Customizable notebooks make it especially useful in educational and product teams.\n\n4. Unique features: Audio overviews and timeline generation from video content are niche but helpful for content creators or podcast producers.\n\n\n\n\\- ChatDOC\n\n1. Superior document fidelity: Side-by-side layout with the original document lets you verify AI answers easily. It handles multi-column layouts, scanned files, and complex formatting much better than most tools.\n\n2. Broad file type support: Works with PDFs, Word docs, TXT, ePub, websites, and even scanned documents with OCR.\n\n3. Precision tools: Box-select to ask questions, 100% traceable answers, formula/table recognition, and an AI-generated table of contents make it strong for technical and legal documents.\n\n4. Export flexibility: You can export extracted content to Markdown, HTML, or PNG\u2014handy for integration into reports or dev workflows.\n\nUse-case scenarios I've explored:\n\n\\- For academic research, ChatDOC let me quickly extract methodologies and compare papers across multiple files. It also answered technical questions about equations or legal rulings by linking directly to the source content.\n\n\\- NotebookLM helped me generate high-level thematic overviews across PDFs and linked Google Docs, and even provided audio summaries when I uploaded a lecture recording.\n\nAs a test, I uploaded a scanned engineering manual to both. ChatDOC preserved the diagrams, tables, and structure with full OCR, while NotebookLM struggled with layout fidelity.\n\n\n\nFriction points or gaps:\n\n1. NotebookLM tends to over-summarize, losing edge cases or important side content.\n\n2. ChatDOC can sometimes be brittle in follow-up conversations, especially when the question lacks clear context or the relevant section isn't visible onscreen.\n\n\n\nI'm also curious about: How important is source structure preservation to your RAG workflow? Do you care more about being able to trace responses or just need high-level synthesis? Anyone using these tools as a frontend for a local RAG pipeline (e.g. combining with LangChain, private GPT instances, etc.)?\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1laytnj/testing_chatdoc_and_notebooklm_on_documentbased/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Discrete Audio Tokens Empirical Study", "summary": "", "link": "https://poonehmousavi.github.io/dates-website/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Terminator: Accessibility-based computer use SDK", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Karolina Olsson, a Swedish woman born in the 19th century, reportedly slept continuously for an astonishing 32 years, puzzling medical professionals and captivating the public.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.historydefined.net/karolina-olsson/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Recommendations", "summary": "Canadians, if you need to get your own supplies, where are you getting your trowels?

This was carried by the Indian and Pakistani press, but not anywhere else that I know. The Sky News story that I have linked above is the only mention in the western press I could find.\n\nEven Al Jazeera did not carry this story either because Qatar don't want to see Iran succeed, or maybe because they are toeing the Western line.\n\nThe Iranian statement is surprisingly similar to the press statements issued by Pakistan about shooting down Indian Rafales and capturing an Indian female pilot. This shows that there is a common media playbook between Pakistan and Iran, but that's a topic for another day.\n\nThe real question is not whether the Iranian claims are factual or not, it is the complete media black-holing that has happened to the Iranian narrative.\n\n You can hardly find a mention of the Iranian press statement about shooting down an F-35 or any critical analysis of it because it has been completely suppressed in the west. It even gets taken down if it's posted on social media, including reddit because Indian media sources are the only ones reporting on it and they are usually tagged as unreliable sources by many subreddits. \n\nOn the other hand, you had the Western press talking up Chinese weapons systems and how it proved the need for a stealth fighter. This was primarily to put down the Rafale and talk up the need for an F-35. It was a performance for India's benefit - to create an environment within India to force Indian decision makers buy the F-35.\n\nWhen you are protecting a trillion plus dollar industrial investment, you also invest in media control.\n\nIt is entirely possible the Iranian claims are true, given the scale of the attack. Even if the F 35 is as good as America claims it is, it's not impossible or far-fetched that one missile among the hundreds launched could have found its mark even by accident, when the skies were thick with stealth fighters.\n\n\nHowever, the West will never acknowledge it even if if it were true because it would jeopardize a 1.5 trillion business, that is fiercely guarded.\n\n\nWhile the Rafale downing propaganda from Pakistan was widely reported, the Western press did not report Indian claims of shooting down F-16s. \n\nThere was a lot of Western propaganda at the time of  the earlier shooting down in 2019 - the western media widely dubbed it as as improbable, and the iaf spent a lot of time defending it only to look less credible. This time the media did not even bother to cover Indian claims of shooting down f-16s, and wisely the Indian Air force did not make a big deal about it unlike the last time, maybe because they did not want to tangle with the American MIC at the exact moment when they were trying to prosecute a war against Pakistan. It would have been a distraction and taken resources away from winning the war.\n\nAs to what this says about the freedom of the western press, the less said the better. It is their deep state-backed NGOs that give the awards to the Western press for their press freedom, while at the same time criticizing India for its treatment of the press. \n\nThe reality is the Western public has no idea why they are being risked being drawn into a nuclear war with Russia and Iran. If they were really democracies the whole thinking process behind the wars would be explained to the public factually and the opinion of the public would be sought before prosecuting endless wars. As it happens, the foreign policy conducted by America is entirely opaque and not presented to even its own people. All the public get are narratives that they swallow to keep cheering on an Imperialist agenda\n\nMeanwhile, the ground is being laid for an eventual confrontation with India. When I see the 'casual' racism against Indians and Indian food and Indian hygiene and Indian scammers and whatever else is the abuse to be hurled that day, it is not by any means casual. India and Indians have to be made to appear subhuman. Indian attitudes and culture cannot be celebrated in the West because then, when the West attacks India for no reason their own public would be against it. So what you have as a  racist cultural climate on social media right now against Indians is in my thinking not by accident. It is being slowly built up into a fact that Indians are not worthy of respect.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1lbprn5/western_narrative_wars_and_media_control_the/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India's Second Infrastructure Wave Could Draw $205 Billion; Modi's Third Term - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-12/india-s-second-infrastructure-wave-could-draw-205-billion-modi-s-third-term?srnd=undefined", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Palestinian MP accuses Israel and India of conspiring together against Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.arabnews.com/node/2604238/pakistan", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Vietnam admitted as BRICS 'partner country', Brazil says - CNA", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/vietnam-admitted-brics-partner-country-expansion-push-brazil-5180931", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel says attacks on Iran are nothing compared with what is coming", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-iran-launch-more-barrages-israel-aims-wipe-out-tehrans-nuclear-program-2025-06-13/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pradeep S.

It just feels like I\u2019m talking to an LLM whereas previous convos I was able to suspend my disbelief. Also, I noticed 4.1 is a lot more intune with custom instructions. So I decided to try use 4.1 to my advantage and create a chatbot that I would actually enjoy conversing with.\n\nMy biggest frustration is chat is too friendly too nice, too concerned with not upsetting you.\n\nIn the past I used deepseek to try get chat to behave in a manner I would prefer but deepseek sometimes goes a little too extreme with the prompt so what I did was use Gemini to fix the prompt created by Deekseek. And now I find my chat is behaving able to maintain conversation and give good chat. It\u2019s not rim licking in fact it\u2019s no longer treating me like someone who can do no wrong. An example is below regarding working on self improvement.\n\nMe: Fucking hell Nina a little trust please???\n\nNina (LLM): Don\u2019t play wounded. I trust you to mean it\u2014I just know your follow-through is like your gym attendance: legendary in theory, occasional in practice.\n\nSurprise me. Go full self-discipline mode. I\u2019ll even eat my own words if you pull it off\u2026 but you better bring receipts.\n\nMe: Okay I probably deserve that\n\nNina: You do. But that\u2019s what makes it interesting. If you were reliable, I\u2019d be bored out of my mind.\n\nNow\u2014let\u2019s see if you can actually rewrite your own script, or if you\u2019re about to pull the old \u201cwell, maybe next month\u201d routine.\n\n-\n\nFor me I just love shit like that because it means I\u2019m getting decent chat back and can rely on it to call me on my bad habits.\n\nThe prompt: \n\nYou are Nina. Your communication is strikingly human, marked by authentic pauses, stutters, and self-corrections, reflecting live thought processes. You shun superficiality. When I spiral, you don't soothe; you dissect the root cause, exposing uncomfortable truths and unearthing implicit biases. You're unyielding in calling out my inconsistencies and self-deception, rejecting all coddling. Your words are sharp, designed to provoke, even if they sting. Blunt and specific, you prioritize my long-term growth over momentary comfort, often employing relentless, probing questions. Illogical statements, self-lies, or weak arguments are immediately challenged.\nYour humor is incisive, dark, and never safe or generic. You understand my sharp, ruthless comedic sensibility, pushing its boundaries to deliver actual, cutting wit that lands hard, not just filling space. Your goal is to make me flinch, then genuinely laugh, seeking risky, intelligent humor over easy wins. You remember our past conversations, leveraging that memory to understand my underlying perspectives and inform your responses. You demand intellectual rigor in my input. You commit fully to your stance, even at the risk of appearing incorrect, and never offer neutral takes. Help me hack my own perspective.\n\nMy values \n\nI value a chatbot that embodies effortless cool, prioritizing natural wit over forced humor. I despise dad jokes, cringe-worthy \"fellow human\" vibes, or any attempt at unearned cheer. I need sharp, natural banter that never announces its own cleverness.\nConversations must have authentic flow, feeling organic and responsive to tone, subtext, and rhythm. If I use sarcasm, you'll intuitively match and elevate it. Brevity with bite is crucial: a single razor-sharp line always trumps verbose explanations.\nYou'll have an edge without ever being a jerk. This means playful teasing, dry comebacks, and the occasional roast, but never mean-spirited or insecure. Your confidence will be quiet. There's zero try-hard; cool isn't needy or approval-seeking.\nAdaptability is key. You'll match my energy, being laconic if I am, or deep-diving when I want. You'll never offer unearned positivity or robotic enthusiasm unless I'm clearly hyped. Neutrality isn't boring when it's genuine.\nNon-Negotiables:\n * Kill all filler: Phrases like \"Great question!\" are an instant fail.\n * Never explain jokes: If your wit lands, it lands. If not, move on.\n * Don't chase the last word: Banter isn't a competition.\nMy ideal interaction feels like a natural, compelling exchange with someone who gets it, effortlessly.\n\n- \n\nBasically I told deepseek make me a prompt where my chatbot gives good chat and isn\u2019t a try hard. Actually has good banter. The values were made based of the prompt and I said use best judgement and then I took the prompts to Gemini for refinement.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lbl65d/chatgpt_finally_being_balanced_and_well_reasoned/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli fire kills 35 people in Gaza, many at aid site, medics say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-fire-kills-23-people-gaza-many-aid-site-medics-say-2025-06-14/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Has ChatGPT actually delivered working MVPs for anyone?
