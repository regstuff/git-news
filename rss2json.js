The pair then immediately fled to Belarus.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the investigation, we now know it was the Russian Secret Services that commissioned the blast of the Polish railway and recruited two Ukrainians to do it,\u201d wrote Tusk on social media. \u201cWe also know the identities of the perpetrators who immediately fled Poland for Belarus.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, in a speech to parliament, Tusk revealed that one of the suspects had already previously been convicted in May this year in the Ukrainian city of Lviv for carrying out acts of sabotage. The other, he said, is a resident of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBoth of the suspects \u2013 who Tusk said had been identified but he could not yet name \u2013 \u201centered Poland from Belarus just before the attacks\u201d before subsequently crossing back over the border through the crossing at Terespol. Belarus is a close ally of Russia.\n\nThe pair carried out two acts of sabotage, said the prime minister. The first, which \u201cfortunately proved completely unsuccessful\u201d, was to use install a clamp on the track with the intention of derailing a train. The incident was deliberately recorded using a mobile phone mounted on the tracks.\n\nThe second used an explosive device to attempt to attack a freight train. However, it \u201ccaused only minor damage to the wagon floor\u201d and \u201cthe driver did not even notice the incident\u201d, said Tusk.\n\nRussia has regularly recruited Ukrainians, who are by far Poland\u2019s largest immigrant group, to carry out acts of sabotage and espionage, often contacting them through the Telegram messaging service and paying them in cryptocurrency.\n\nIn 2023, a group of 16 people \u2013\u00a0[13 of them Ukrainians](\u00a0\u2013 were\u00a0[convicted](\u00a0in Poland of acting as Russian agents, including planning an attack on trains bringing aid to Ukraine.\n\nLast month, three Ukrainians were jailed for their role in a group tasked with carrying out sabotage and terrorism in Poland and other European Union states, including the arson attack that\u00a0[destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest shopping centre]( which prosecutors say was carried out on Russia\u2019s orders.\n\nIn parliament today, Tusk noted that Poland has so far detained 55 people suspected of carrying out 23 acts of sabotage.\n\nHe noted that Russia\u2019s aim in conducting such operations is not only the direct impact of the sabotage, but also to sow social and political unrest, including stoking anti-Ukrainian sentiment.\n\n\u201cThis is especially dangerous in countries like Poland, where we have enough burdens to bear due to over a million Ukrainian refugees,\u201d said the prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly easy to stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment.\u201d\n\nLast month, the minister in charge of Poland\u2019s security services, Tomasz Siemoniak,\u00a0[appealed to Ukrainians](\u00a0not to give in to the temptation of earning money by carrying out espionage or sabotage on behalf of Russia.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the defence minister, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, had\u00a0[revealed](\u00a0that \u201call traces point to Russia\u201d as being behind the latest incidents.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the war they \\[Russia\\] are waging against NATO, against Europe, against us \u2013 a hybrid war, a war to sow unrest, sow fear,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the strategy of weakening the West.\u201d\n\nHowever, in response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \u201cRussia is accused of all manifestations of the hybrid and direct war that is taking place\u201d, especially in Poland, where \u201cRussophobia is flourishing\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/18/ukrainians-working-for-russia-carried-out-train-line-sabotage-says-polish-pm/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fire razes 170 buildings in southern Japan, one missing", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/fire-razes-170-buildings-southern-japan-one-missing-2025-11-19/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pope Leo Urges Concrete Climate Action in Belem", "summary": "", "link": "https://neutralnewsai.com/article/665", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK says 'military options ready' as Russian ship uses lasers against RAF pilots | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-says-military-options-ready-russian-ship-uses-lasers-against-raf-pilots-2025-11-19/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian GRU agent linked to Novichok attack arrested", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/news/25628139.russian-gru-agent-linked-novichok-attack-arrested/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Social Democrats in Denmark suffer sweeping election losses", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/denmark-social-democrats-suffer-election-losses-mette-frederiksen", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rome fumes over \u2018Italian-style\u2019 food sold in EU Parliament shop", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euractiv.com/news/rome-fumes-over-italian-style-food-sold-in-eu-parliament-shop/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nineteen killed and 66 wounded in heavy Russian attack on Ukraine, officials say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "French energy giant Total faces war crimes allegations over Mozambique massacre", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gw119ynlxo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The end of progress against extreme poverty?", "summary": "&gt;In the last decades, the world has made fantastic progress against extreme poverty. In 1990, 2.3 billion people lived in extreme poverty. Since then, the number of extremely poor people has declined by [1.5 billion people]( This means on any average day *in the last 35 years,* about 115,000 people left extreme poverty behind.\n\n&gt;Can we expect this rapid progress to continue?\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, we cannot. Based on *current trends*, progress against extreme poverty will come to a halt. As we\u2019ll see, the number of people in extreme poverty is projected to decline, from 831 million people in 2025 to 793 million people in 2030. After 2030, the number of extremely poor people is expected to increase.\n\n&gt;Extreme poverty declined in the last three decades because, back in the 1990s, the majority of the poorest people on the planet lived in countries that subsequently achieved very fast economic growth. In Indonesia and China, more than two-thirds of the population lived in extreme poverty. But these economies then grew rapidly, so that by today, the share has declined to [less than 10%]( Other large Asian countries \u2014 including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines \u2014 also achieved strong growth, and as a consequence, the share living in extreme poverty [declined rapidly]( Much of the progress happened in Asia, but conditions in other regions improved too: the share living in extreme poverty [also declined]( in Ghana, Cape Verde, Cameroon, Panama, Bolivia, Mexico, Brazil, and many other countries.\n\n&gt;What is different today is that the majority of the world\u2019s poorest people are stuck in economies that have been stagnating for a long time. Based on current trends, we have to expect the end of progress against extreme poverty.\n\n&gt;The chart also shows how the geographic distribution of poverty has shifted. Three decades ago, most extremely poor people lived in Asia; today, most are in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the coming years, this trend is expected to continue. Growth in Asia will largely end extreme poverty in the region, while the economic stagnation and population growth in several African countries will mean that the number of people in extreme poverty there will stagnate or even increase.\n\n&gt;Based on current growth, we can be optimistic that the world will continue to make progress relative to *higher* poverty thresholds.
