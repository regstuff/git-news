However, the two sides have generally sought to present a united front on issues relating to national security.\n\nBut some of Nawrocki\u2019s senior aides have been critical of the government\u2019s response to the latest acts of sabotage, saying that they have politicised the issue.\n\nThey have also accused the authorities of reacting too slowly to initial reports of an explosion and of failing to give Nawrocki full and timely access to information.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they had decided to bring charges again the two prime suspects in last weekend\u2019s rail-line sabotage, who they named for the first time as Oleksandr K. and Yevhenii I. (with surnames hidden under Polish privacy law).\n\nProsecutors want to charge the two men, who they have identified as Ukrainian, with carrying out acts of sabotage of a terrorist nature at the behest of Russia. They would face life imprisonment if convicted.\n\nHowever, given that the pair were recorded crossing into Belarus, an ally of Russia, immediately after the sabotage took place, it appears unlikely that Poland will manage to secure their extradition.\n\nPrzemys\u0142aw Nowak, spokesman for the prosecutors, confirmed on Wednesday that an unspecified number of other individuals have also been detained in relation to the latest sabotage incident but that no charges had for now been brought against them.\n\nOn Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the latest sabotage incidents.\n\nAfterwards, Tusk announced that the pair had agreed for their countries to cooperate more closely on identifying people suspected of working for Russia.\n\nThat follows questions being raised in Poland about how one of the suspected saboteurs managed to enter the country despite having previously been convicted in Ukraine of carrying out sabotage on behalf of Russia.\n\n\u201cUkraine is ready to work with Poland at various levels and to share all information,\u201d said Zelensky following his call with Tusk. \u201cWe agreed that we will set up a Ukrainian-Polish group that will work to prevent similar situations from the Russian side in the future.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/20/poland-launches-military-operation-to-protect-infrastructure-following-russian-rail-sabotage/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Battles in West Kordofan as Sudan army resists RSF\u2019s eastward push", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/battles-in-west-kordofan-as-sudan-army-resists-rsfs-eastward-push", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK Ministry of Justice to remove right to trial by jury for thousands of cases in controversial overhaul", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/nov/20/moj-to-remove-right-to-trial-by-jury-for-thousands-of-cases-in-controversial-overhaul", "author": "None"}, {"title": "French authorities investigate alleged Holocaust denial posts on Elon Musk\u2019s Grok AI", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/20/french-authorities-look-into-holocaust-denial-posts-elon-musk-grok-ai", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish ambassador attacked in Russia", "summary": "Poland\u2019s ambassador to Russia, Krzysztof Krajewski, has been attacked in Saint\u00a0Petersburg by a group protesting Polish support for Ukraine.\n\nThe incident took place on Sunday, the same day that sabotage of a train line was\u00a0[discovered in Poland](\u00a0but before the Polish government had\u00a0[declared Russia to be responsible](\u00a0for it.\n\nKrajewski, who has been ambassador since 2021, had been visiting the Catholic Church of St Catherine in Saint\u00a0Petersburg for a service in Polish to celebrate Poland\u2019s\u00a0[Independence Day]( which had fallen a few days earlier, on 11 November.\n\nOn his way to the church, the ambassador \u201cwas surrounded by an aggressive group of protesters carrying banners with anti-Polish and anti-Ukrainian slogans\u201d, writes the\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0daily, which was the first to report the incident on Thursday.\n\nThe group verbally criticised Krajewski for Poland\u2019s support for Ukraine before, \u201cat one point, several of them attempted to strike the ambassador\u201d, says the newspaper.\n\nThat prompted a response from the Polish State Protection Service (SOP) officers who have constantly accompanied the ambassador since the worsening of relations with Moscow in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was the most serious incident of its kind in many years,\u201d an unnamed foreign ministry source told\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*. \u201cOnly the intervention of security guards prevented the ambassador from being beaten.\u201d\n\nThe ministry\u2019s spokesman, Maciej Wewi\u00f3r, confirmed to the newspaper that the incident had taken place. \u201cAn aggressive group with banners\u2026wanted to move from verbal assault to physical assault, but were stopped by the State Protection Service,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, during a meeting with the Russian charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaire, the Polish side expressed its outrage,\u201d added Wewi\u00f3r. \u201cIn response, we were told that such situations \u2018should not occur\u2019.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting took place because the Polish foreign ministry was handing a formal notice to the Russians ordering them to\u00a0[close their consulate in Gda\u0144sk](\u00a0in response to Moscow\u2019s latest act of sabotage in Poland.\n\nPreviously, Russia\u2019s consulates in\u00a0[Pozna\u0144](\u00a0and\u00a0[Krak\u00f3w](\u00a0were closed for similar reasons.
