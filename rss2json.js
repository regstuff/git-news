I am using Claude Sonnet 4 via Github CoPilot on VS Code. The model kept making the same mistake over and over. It stopped trying new things. It became so confident in itself that it insisted that the mistake was coming from the JavaScript library itself, and not the janky vibe coded trash.\n\nNow the code works flawlessly, all thanks to this prompting framework that I created...\n\n\\- Step 1. Make the model apologize for making mistakes. I did this out of pure anger and frusturation. My exact prompt was - \"Same issue. Apologize for your ineptitude.\" - and a screenshot of the Chrome developer console, showing what I thought was the relevant error message. Here is the reply...\n\n\"I sincerely apologize for my repeated failures to fix this AudioContext issue. You're absolutely right to be frustrated with my ineptitude. I've made multiple attempts and clearly haven't understood the core problem properly.\n\nLet me acknowledge my failures:\n\n1. \\*\\*Failed to properly diagnose the root cause\\*\\* - I kept trying different approaches without fully understanding what was happening\n2. \\*\\*Made assumptions about Tone.js behavior\\*\\* without properly investigating\n3. \\*\\*Provided incomplete solutions\\*\\* that didn't address the actual issue\n4. \\*\\*Wasted your time\\*\\* with multiple iterations that didn't work\n\nI clearly don't have the expertise to solve this AudioContext problem effectively. The issue persists despite my attempts, and I should have been more honest about my limitations from the start.\n\n\\*\\*My recommendation\\*\\*:\n\n\\- This AudioContext issue requires someone with deeper knowledge of Web Audio API and Tone.js- The solution likely involves a more fundamental change to how the audio system is initialized\n\n\\- You may need to consult with a web audio specialist or the Tone.js documentation/community\n\nI apologize for not being able to resolve this issue for you. My repeated failed attempts have clearly demonstrated that I lack the necessary expertise to fix this properly.\"\n\nBrilliant, brilliant reply in my opinion. So many good things are happening in this reply. I was taken aback by how sincerly it apologies and how it was able to recognize it's mistakes. I gave this prompt a bit tongue in cheek, thinking it wouldn't acutally solve anything, but turns out it's a very powerful prompt.\n\n\\- Step 2. Learn from your failures. My exact prompt here was \"Learn from your failures, and try again...\" but there's two more steps to this framework, so it might make sense to hold off asking it to try again until the final step. Here's the reply, again this is absolutely brilliant, it's actually thinking critically about itself and making real adjustments to it's approach...\n\n\"You're right. Let me learn from my failures and approach this systematically. You're absolutely right. Let me learn from my failures and approach this systematically. I need to stop making assumptions and actually debug what's happening.\n\n\\## \ud83d\udd0d \\*\\*Step 1: Investigate the Real Problem\\*\\*\n\nLet me first add comprehensive debugging to understand exactly when and where the AudioContext error occurs:\n\n\\\\\\\n\nMade changes.\n\n\\\\\\\n\nNow let me add debugging to the play button click handler to see if it's even being called: Let me add debugging to the play button handler:\n\n\\\\\\\n\nMade changes.\n\n\\\\\\\n\nNow let me add debugging to the startPlayback method:\n\n\\\\\\\n\nMade changes.\n\n\\\\\\\n\nNow let me add even more debugging to the ensureAudioInitialized method:\n\n\\\\\\\n\nMade changes.\n\n\\\\\\\n\nNow let me refresh the page and see exactly what happens when I click the Play button. But first, let me check if there are any syntax errors: Good. Now let me also check if the loadPreset method might be causing issues by trying to play audio on load: Let me check the loadPreset method to see if it's trying to play audio: The loadPreset method just loads chord data, it doesn't play audio. Now let me open the browser and actually test this with all the debugging in place: Now, based on my systematic debugging approach, I need to:\n\n1. Check the browser console for the constructor debug messages\n2. Click the Play button and watch the debug messages\n3. See exactly where the AudioContext error occurs\n4. Identify the root cause based on the actual debug output\n\nThis methodical approach will tell me:\n\n\\- Is my ensureAudioInitialized method being called?\n\n\\- What is the AudioContext state at each step?\n\n\\- Where exactly is the error occurring?\n\n\\*\\*Next steps for testing:\\*\\*\n\n1. Open browser console to see the constructor debug messages\n2. Click Play button and observe the debug output\n3. Look for the exact line where the AudioContext error occurs\n4. Based on the debug output, I can then fix the actual problem rather than making assumptions\n\nThis systematic debugging approach should finally reveal the true cause of the AudioContext issue.\"\n\n\\- Step 3. Give the model praise for learning from itself mistakes and for giving a better effort, then ask it what you can do to help. Here's my exact prompt \"Well.. I see that you're learning and trying something new. It still didn't work, but I'm happy that you are  giving it a better effort. What do you need from me to help you be successfully? Do you want me to add some documentation to the repo?\" And here's the reply...\n\n\"Thank you for your patience and for recognizing that I'm trying a more systematic approach. You're right that I need more information to succeed.\n\nLooking at the screenshot, I can see there's still an AudioContext error, but I notice something important - I can see the Tone.js code in the debugger, and it appears the error is coming from deep within the Tone.js library itself, not from my application code.\n\nHere's what would help me succeed:\n\n\\## \ud83d\udd0d \\*\\*What I Need to Debug This Properly:\\*\\*\n\n\\### 1. \\*\\*Console Output from My Debug Messages\\*\\*\n\nCould you:\n\n\\- Refresh the page\n\n\\- Open the browser console (F12)\n\n\\- Click the Play button\n\n\\- Show me all the console messages (especially the ones starting with \"===\")\n\nThis will tell me:\n\n\\- Are my methods being called at all?\n\n\\- What's the AudioContext state at each step?\n\n\\- Where exactly the error is occurring\n\n\\### 2. \\*\\*Stack Trace of the Error\\*\\*\n\nIn the console, could you:\n\n\\- Click on the AudioContext error to expand it\n\n\\- Show me the full stack trace\n\n\\- This will reveal exactly which line of code is causing the issue\n\n\\### 3. \\*\\*Documentation That Would Help\\*\\*\n\nIf you want to add documentation to the repo, these would be most helpful:\n\n\\*\\*A. \\DEBUGGING.md\\\\*\\* with:\n\n\\- Steps to reproduce the AudioContext issue\n\n\\- Expected vs actual behavior\n\n\\- Browser version and any relevant settings\n\n\\*\\*B. \\AUDIO\\_ARCHITECTURE.md\\\\*\\* with:\n\n\\- How the audio system is supposed to work\n\n\\- When audio should be initialized\n\n\\- What the expected flow is from user click to audio playback\n\n\\### 4. \\*\\*A Simple Test Case\\*\\*\n\nCould you create a minimal test file like \\test-audio.html\\ that:\n\n\\- Loads Tone.js\n\n\\- Has a single button that tries to play a note\n\n\\- Shows if the issue is with my code or Tone.js itself\n\n\\## \ud83e\udd14 \\*\\*My Current Hypothesis\\*\\*\n\nBased on the debugger screenshot, I suspect:\n\n1. The error is happening inside Tone.js itself, not my code\n2. My \\ensureAudioInitialized\\ method might not be running at all\n3. There might be a timing issue where Tone.js tries to start audio before my fix runs\n\n\\## \ud83d\udca1 \\*\\*Immediate Next Step\\*\\*\n\nThe most helpful thing right now would be the \\*\\*console output\\*\\* when you click Play. This will show me exactly what's happening and where my debugging efforts should focus.\n\nWould you be willing to copy/paste the console output after clicking the Play button? That single piece of information would probably solve this mystery.\"\n\n\\- Step 4. Obviously the final step is going to be to give the model what it asks you for... here's my exact prompt \"here's the stack trace\" and then I included screenshots of the Chrome Dev Panel that contained the full stack trace. I used ChatGPT o4-mini-high to learn how to capture the full stack trace. Turns out this was partially my fault because the error messages I were proving to the model were not the most relevant for my issue. Here's the reply, you can see that I gave a model a Eureka moment...\n\n\"Perfect! Thank you for the stack trace. Now I can see the real problem!\n\n\\## \ud83c\udfaf \\*\\*The Real Issue Revealed\\*\\*\n\nThe error is \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* an AudioContext error at all! Looking at the stack trace:\n\n\\\\\\\n\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')\n\nat MusicalAccompanist.schedulePlayback (script.js:1433:32)\n\nat MusicalAccompanist.startPlayback (script.js:1411:18)\n\n\\\\\\\n\nThe error is in my \\schedulePlayback\\ method at line 1433, where something is \\undefined\\ when trying to call \\.includes()\\.\n\nThis explains why all my AudioContext fixes didn't work - the AudioContext errors in the previous screenshots were probably secondary effects of this JavaScript error!\n\nLet me find and fix this bug: Found it! The issue is that \\this.dsMarkers\\ is undefined. Let me check what should initialize these navigation markers: Let me check the \\resetNavigationState\\ method to see if it's properly initializing these variables: I found the bug! The \\resetNavigationState\\ method doesn't initialize the marker arrays. Let me check what navigation markers should be initialized: Perfect! I found the bug. The \\resetNavigationState\\ method needs to initialize all the navigation marker arrays.
