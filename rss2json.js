In other word, if you remove the adjective, the sentence of the meaning remains the same.\n\nFor example, given the sentence \n\n&gt;I am thrilled, and tremendously excited.\n\nI would like to modify the sentence to be something like\n\n&gt;I am excited.\n\nOr \n\n&gt;I am thrilled.\n\nBut, I don't want to modify a sentence like:\n\n&gt;It identifies ill-mannered buyers\n\nIf I were just removing all adjectives, I would remove the word ill-mannered. However, in my opinion, ill-mannered is essential to the meaning of the sentence.\n\nI know about nonrestrictive adjectie clauses, but those are required to be seperated by commas, which is not the only case I'm interested in. So I have 2 questions: \n\n* Is there a (linguistic?) term for what I'm looking for?\n* Can I identify these sorts of \"unnecessary\" adjectives using a rule-based system (ie. looking the parts of speech in a constituent tree), or is this better handled by a language model of some sort?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1dfiku7/identifying_unnecessary_adjectives/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Supreme Court rejects bid to restrict access to abortion pill", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rejects-bid-restrict-access-abortion-pill-rcna151308", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sifu is an application that provides insights into every version of your dependencies to keep them updated", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/majidsajadi/sifu", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Free contraception helps Finland reduce teenage abortions by 66%", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/free-contraception-helps-finland-reduce-teenage-abortions-by-66-2024-06-03/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Crime has got out of hand\u2019: the young Germans disaffected with the political mainstream", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/14/young-germans-afd-european-elections", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018The gangs never used to kill children, now they do\u2019: how cocaine created Argentina\u2019s first narcocity", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/13/argentina-rosario-drug-trade-cocaine", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ikea\u2019s boss solved the Swedish retailer\u2019s global \u2018unhappy worker\u2019 crisis by raising salaries, introducing flexible working and subsidizing childcare", "summary": "", "link": "https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/11/ikeas-boss-solved-swedish-retailers-global-unhappy-worker-crisis-raising-salaries-introducing-flexible-working-subsidized-childcare/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "60% of Ukrainians believe Russian goal in war is destruction of Ukrainian identity", "summary": "", "link": "https://gwaramedia.com/en/60-of-ukrainians-believe-that-russia-s-main-goal-in-war-is-genocide-and-destruction-of-nation/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Stanley Cup Final: Florida Panthers take 3-0 series lead", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Stanley Cup Final: Florida Panthers take 3-0 series lead</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDYvMTMvc3BvcnQvZmxvcmlkYS1wYW50aGVycy1lZG1vbnRvbi1vaWxlcnMtc3RhbmxleS1jdXAtZmluYWwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-06-14", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 Trevor Lawrence tied for highest-paid player in NFL after signing record extension, reports say", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 Trevor Lawrence tied for highest-paid player in NFL after signing record extension, reports say</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDYvMTMvc3BvcnQvamFja3NvbnZpbGxlLWphZ3VhcnMtdHJldm9yLWxhd3JlbmNlLWV4dGVuc2lvbi1uZmwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-06-14", "author": "None"}]}}};
