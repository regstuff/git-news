Been seeing lots of great CRM-related posts recently, and wanted to ask you all a relevant question that I feel hasn't totally been covered yet. \n\nI'm a 21 year old Old World Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Studies BA student about to enter my senior year. I go to a great program for Mediterranean arch and have relevant coursework, with a good portion being in languages or art historical archaeology though with a fair amount in more traditionally archaeological interpretation, especially on the Maya and the prehistoric Mediterranean. I have planned for a long time to pursue a PhD in Near Eastern Archaeology and a lot of my coursework reflects that, but I'm now considering doing at least a few years in CRM based on what people have told me. Specifically, I would love to try a full-time job before I decide on a PhD, I want more field experience (especially survey) before proceeding, and my girlfriend (who's from the Southwest) and I would want to try to live there for a couple of years, and there's obviously a fair amount of CRM work in AZ/NM/TX.\n\nMainly, I wanted to ask about how feasible it is to get work in CRM with an Old World Arch. degree and field experience in a non-field school project in the Mediterranean. I've got good classroom experience and will have worked three seasons on a research excavation project through my university. The problem is, of course, that much of that coursework is more art historical/old world archaeological (they haven't offered really any coursework relevant to American archaeology, other than historical archaeology of the region my school is in) and the project I work on is, from what I can tell, pretty different from CRM work. It's an open-air, layer-by-layer excavation that moves at a relatively slow pace but recovers a good amount of material -- very different from the efficiency-based spits of CRM and no survey experience whatsoever.\n\nAm I screwed? Do I need to do an American field school before putting myself on the market? Also, I have an option to pick up an Anthro major for just two more courses (intro to socio-cultural and a senior seminar) -- would that make a direct difference in marketability? Finally, are there any courses I should try to take?
