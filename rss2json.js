So I built a JSON-based system to give them persistent memory. It actually seems to work.**\n\nEvery time I opened a new session with ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor, I had to start from scratch: what the project was, who it was for, the tech stack, goals, edge cases \u2014 the whole thing. It felt like working with an intern who had no long-term memory.\n\nSo I started experimenting. Instead of dumping a wall of text into the prompt window, I created a set of structured JSON files that broke the project down into reusable chunks: things like project_metadata.json (goals, tone, industry), technical_context.json (stack, endpoints, architecture), user_personas.json, strategic_context.json, and a context_index.json that acts like a table of contents and ingestion guide.\n\nOnce I had the files, I\u2019d add them to the project files of whatever model I was working with and told it to ingest them at the start of a session and treat them as persistent reference. This works great with the project files feature in Chatgpt and Claude. I'd set a rule, something like: \u201cThese files contain all relevant context for this project. Ingest and refer to them for future responses.\u201d\n\nThe results were pretty wild. I instantly recognized that the output seemed faster, more concise and just over all way better. So I asked some diagnostic questions to the LLMs:\n\n*\u201cHow has your understanding of this project improved on a scale of 0\u2013100? Please assess your contextual awareness, operational efficiency, and ability to provide relevant recommendations.\u201d*\n\nstuff like that. Claude and GPT-4o both self-assessed an 85\u201395% increase in comprehension when I asked them to rate contextual awareness. Cursor went further and estimated that token usage could drop by 50% or more due to reduced repetition.\n\nBut what stood out the most was the shift in tone \u2014 instead of just answering my questions, the models started anticipating needs, suggesting architecture changes, and flagging issues I hadn\u2019t even considered. Most importantly whenever a chat window got sluggish or stopped working (happens with long prompts \\*sigh\\*), boom new window, use the files for context, and it's like I never skipped a beat. I also created some cursor rules to check the context bundle and update it after major changes so the entire context bundle is pushed into my git repo when I'm done with a branch. Always up to date\n\nThe full write-up (with file examples and a step-by-step breakdown) is here if you want to dive deeper:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [\n\nCurious if others are doing something similar. Has anyone else tried a structured approach like this to carry context between sessions? Would love to hear how you\u2019re tackling persistent memory, especially if you\u2019ve found other lightweight solutions that don\u2019t involve fine-tuning or vector databases. Also would love if anyone is open to trying this system and see if they are getting the same results.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m0ik3q/stop_repeating_yourself_how_i_use_context/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "We built an open tool to compare voice APIs in real time", "summary": "We recently built [Soniox Compare]( a tool that lets you test real-time voice AI systems side by side.\n\nYou can simply speak into your mic in desired language or stream an audio file instead of your voice.\n\nThe same audio is sent to multiple providers (Soniox, Google, OpenAI, etc) and their outputs appear live, side by side.\n\nWe built this because evaluating speech APIs is surprisingly tedious.
