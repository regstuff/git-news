Concept Visual Map\n\nInspired by a project from the Faculty of Arts at Charles University, which created an interactive map of Europe and the Middle East featuring locations mentioned in Czech travelogues written before 1900. Clicking on a place shows a list of books that mention it, along with the exact excerpts from each book describing that location.\n\nI want to automate and expand this idea with AI, include English and other languages, and integrate fictional worlds, scientific literature, abstract concepts, and various phenomena. The goal is to analyze how different people describe for example:\n\n* Fictional places like Minas Tirith or Mordor and how these descriptions evolve over time\n* The first meeting of two characters and how it is written in different contexts.\n* In scientific literature: how cells, species, or physical phenomena were described at different times and in different parts of the world.\n\nIdeally, the data should also be exportable in format that is easy to conver to cluster graphs for further analysis.\n\nFor fictional worlds/travelogues, the process could work like this:\n\n* Use curl (or another method) to extract keyword-based text snippets.\n* Have AI determine the most relevant excerpts.\n* Let AI/deterministic algoritm or combination of both (promt generrated by deterministic algoritm) assign tags (where on map excerpts belong + additonal metadata) form processed text.\n* Connect the processed text (and possibly images) with an interactive map.\n\nThe system should link to a database of books and texts, automatically processing them into an interactive map.\n\nAI Approach:\n\nI hope to use OpenAI\u2019s API, but I also want the option to run local models (such as MistralAI) and choose from various commercial AI APIs.\n\nBonus Feature: Distributed Collaboration\n\nThe system should allow contributors to download a dataset, process it on their local machine, and send results back to the server hosting the interactive map.\n\nThe design should ensure:\n\n* Contributors cannot modify the assigned dataset, only process it.\n\n1. One Offline Frontend for all/most Open-Source TTS Models\n\nThis is essentially a TTS audiobook/podcast maker with a strong focus on user customization. Inspired by Murf AI\u2019s interface, the idea is to provide a fully offline solution using open-source models.\n\nTarget models: Bark, Coqui, eSpeak NG,+ Microsoft AI TTS, and others. Key Features:\n\n* Custom Voice Profiles: Users can create profiles for each AI voice (trained voice models working alongside the main TTS model).\n* AI Voice \"chat like conversations\": The UI should enable conversations between AI voices, allowing users to simulate voice acting and switch profiles dynamically.\n* Audio Export: Users should be able to play generated speech or send it directly to Audacity (or ideally, create a plugin for Audacity, FL Studio, DaVinci Resolve...).\n* Regeneration Consistency: Ability to regenerate any text with the same or eddited settings easily at any time.\n\nI aim for a clean, professional UI, similar to Murf AI or Eleven Labs.\n\nMain Challenges &amp; What I have to  Learn:\n\nI struggle with most of this features I described above in both projects but for thise I even have no idea where I should start:\n\n* How to properly connect frontend and backend for the TTS tool?\n* How to integrate extracted text and tags into an interactive map?\n\nSo what technologies/languages/frameworks should I learn before starting? If possible, could someone break these projects into smaller, manageable steps I could work on while learning?\n\nWould love any advice or resources that could help!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1iyvftb/what_should_i_learn_to_build_these_two_projects/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "When she was 23, Rosemary Kennedy, the sister of JFK and RFK, had a forced lobotomy arranged by her father.

This event is designed to encourage innovation and collaboration in the Information Extraction field, focusing on software mentions in scholarly articles.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Task Overview:**\n\nSoftware plays an essential role in scientific research and is considered one of the crucial entity types in scholarly documents. However, the software is usually not cited formally in academic documents, resulting in various informal software mentions. Automatic identification and disambiguation of software mentions, related attributes, and the purpose of software mentions contributes to the better understanding, accessibility, and reproducibility of research but is a challenging task.\n\nThis competition invites participants to develop a system that detects software mentions and their attributes as named entities from scholarly texts and classifies the relationships between these entity pairs.
