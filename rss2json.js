Maybe I\u2019m using the wrong template. I\u2019m not sure.\n\nI also adjusted the PARAMETERS, here is mine:\n\n&gt;PARAMETER stop \"&lt;|start\\_header\\_id|&gt;\"\n\n&gt;PARAMETER stop \"&lt;|end\\_header\\_id|&gt;\"\n\n&gt;PARAMETER stop \"&lt;|eot\\_id|&gt;\"\n\n&gt;PARAMETER stop \"&lt;|eom\\_id|&gt;\"\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;PARAMETER seed 42\n\n&gt;PARAMETER temperature 0\n\n&gt;PARAMETER top\\_k 1\n\n&gt;PARAMETER top\\_p 1\n\n&gt;PARAMETER num\\_predict 22\n\n&gt;PARAMETER repeat\\_penalty 1.35\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\\# Soft identity stop (note the leading space):\n\n&gt;PARAMETER stop \" I am \\[xyz\\], an AI model created by \\[abc\\] Labs in Australia.\"\n\nIf anyone knows why this is happening or if it\u2019s truly a template issue, please help. I followed everything in the Unsloth documentation, but there might be something I missed.\n\nThank you.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1oei799/how_to_load_a_fine_tuned_model_to_ollama_nothing/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "William Patrick Hitler, Hitler's nephew, moved to the United States and joined the Navy in 1939 and penned an article titled \"Why I Hate My Uncle.\"", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/plkj3ykqq1xf1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Autistic man axed by Waitrose after working for free for four years offered paid job at Asda", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/autistic-man-waitrose-job-asda-32735845", "author": "None"}, {"title": "German soldier shot by police during training exercise", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/german-solider-police-shooting-training-exercise-bavaria/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "mRNA COVID vaccines may be helping some cancer patients fight tumors, researchers say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/mrna-covid-vaccines-may-be-helping-some-cancer-patients-fight-tumors-researchers-say", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Has anyone got Code Interpreter working with the Gemini Pipeline function?", "summary": "I just get the code within the code interpreter tags.
