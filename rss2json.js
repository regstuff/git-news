I'm making this post after testing out the new notes feature for a couple days, in the hopes it might reach the devs ears. I've been looking forward to it, as it's been on the roadmap for quite a while. Although I know it's still in beta, I found myself quite disappointed with the limited scope of features, many of which are contrary to the precise control and freedom that OpenWebUI gives elsewhere. I want to make clear that I love the concept and versatility of the project, and I'm grateful to the devs and community for their great work! That said, the notes functionality needs serious work if it's going to compete with the likes of Evernote, OneNote, and Obsidian.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my suggestions on how to improve the notes app.\n\n**Core Note Features:**\n\n* Notes sections: Currently, notes are only filterable by \"Today\", \"Tommorow\" ETC. It should be possible to create sections like \"Work Notes\", \"Bio Class\", \"Documentation\", with simple and intuitive visual separation. This does not mean folder icons, as those add extra difficulty in finding what you want, but rather collapsible sections or something similar.\n* Tabbed notes: It's currently only possible to reference one note at a time, but this makes it difficult to copy/paste or cross-reference different notes. Tabbed notes would resolve this problem.\n* A notes side bar: Currently, when in the notes section, the side bar is still present, but only used for the previous chats section. Why not simply put an alphabetical list of the notes by section in the side bar when in the notes mode for easy access?\n* Notes filters: Why not allow users to view their notes list by alphabetical order, recency, and so on?\n* Universal Search: Currently, using the search bar for chats doesn't bring up any results for notes. Why not unify the search experience and allow searching for both chats and notes?\n* Auto-Tagging: Currently, OpenWebUI allows the AI to generate titles and tags for chats automatically. Why not also automatically generate tags for notes to make sorting and searching even easier?\n* Font style and sizing: The current font size and style is a bit difficult to read, as it is small. It would be best to change this to maximize readability\n* Mass Import: It would be good to add an import button and a mass import function that allows one to import an entire directory to make switching as easy as possible\n* Markdown Editing: Currently, markdown rendering is a bit weird, with no real way to change the size of a header, or unbold something. Why not show the markdown icons around the text, and allow them to be freely edited, similar to Obsidian?\n* Advanced Markdown: I'm not sure which spec of markdown is being used, but it doesn't seem to support some tags, like checkboxes. It might be a good idea to include more advanced markdown functionality.\n* Character/Word/Token counts: Good notes apps usually have precise counts so that the user knows how long their notes are. OpenWebUI can leverage it's unique position as an AI app, and provide token counts as well.\n\n**Core AI Features:**\n\n* Variable command editing: Currently, when in notes, there is only a single button, \"enhance\" which automatically rewrites the whole page. The prompt it uses is completely opaque, and the placement of the button is out of the way and unintuitive. This is inconsistent and antithetical to OpenWebUI's existing design philosophy of freedom and precise control. Instead of this system, when a section is highlighted and right clicked, it brings up a context menu with multiple simple options, like \"Summarize\", \"Correct spelling and grammar\", \"Make more detailed\", \"Reformat\", etc. This menu would be fully customizable, with the ability to add as many custom commands as one would like, and even remove or rewrite the default ones. This allows the users to have ultimate control and only be limited by their own prompt engineering skills. Furthermore, the ability to only rewrite a specific part of the text is crucial for writers and notetakers. It is also in line with OpenWebUI's existing highlight menu with \"Ask\" and \"Explain\".\n* Transcription Settings: Currently, it seems like the transcription feature of the voice notes uses the local copy of faster-whisper, which is great, but there are currently no ways to configure the model being used. While users might prefer a lighter model like whisper small for real-time dictation, when transcribing a critical business meeting afterwards, they might need the highest accuracy they can get, whisper large. Instead of just setting one model and rolling with it, it would be great if there was a small dropdown menu that allowed the user to pick a whisper model from the ones they have installed. Additionally, the ability to manually pick the language of transcription may also be helpful.\n* Video Transcription: Since most meetings are recorded as videos, it would greatly reduce friction if video files could be converted to audio and transcribed seamlessly.\n* RAG access: It would be very useful if you could reference your notes in the chat section by automatically treating them as a knowledge base automatically. Automatically vectorizing them 30 seconds after the user has finished editing them should make this process seamless.\n\n**Extra Functionality:**\n\n* Links: It would be a great feature if you could link notes to other notes. If done manually, this could be done using the double square bracket syntax like obsidian. However, if done using a multi-step process, it should be possible to automatically extract related words and create a knowledge graph. In which case, a graph view to go with it would also be great.\n* Criticism mode: It would be great if there was a toggle in which you could have an LLM fully review and give constructive criticism of your notes/essays without changing anything, as comments on the side.\n* Auto-Backup: To prevent massive loss of data from a botched docker command and the like, there should be a setting to automatically backup notes to a directory outside the docker volume\n* Auto-Sync Knowledge Bases: It would be great if in the knowledge base section you could set a directory to auto-sync at a certain interval, like 30 seconds, 5 min, 1 day, ETC. Currently you have to use a python script and the API to do this, or hit sync manually, which is terrible for frequently updated information.\n* To-Do List: It would be great if you could use the transcription feature to dictate what you have to do, then use function calling to create tasks and subtasks in an organized structure. This could be integrated with functionality similar to OpenAI's Scheduled Tasks, sending a prompt to the model at the correct time to send you a notification or even execute agentic behavior using tool calling.\n\nThat's the comprehensive list. I know one of the extras isn't related to notes, but forgive that. The extras section aren't strictly necessary, but they are all features that would give OpenWebUI a competitive edge. In case someone asks why I don't implement these features myself, I am a complete beginner to programming, and have nowhere near the skill to properly contribute, or I would like to. I know this is a lot of feedback, but I believe that a lot of these are reasonably small tweaks that would have a very big effect, propelling OpenWebUI to feature parity with big note apps like OneNote, Obsidian, ETC, while taking advantage of its' unique strengths as an AI app. I hope this reaches the devs, and I'd like to again give my thanks for all they do!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1klznzg/notes_feature_suggestions/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Qwen3 GRPO now in Unsloth!", "summary": "We're releasing a new advanced GRPO notebook for fine-tuning Qwen3.

Give it examples.**  \n  \nIf you want AI to generate content that sounds like you, give it examples of how you sound.

Use AI to Research at Speed**\n\nMost people treat AI like a Google clone. Wrong. Let AI ask *you* questions.\n\nPrompt Example:\n\nYou are an AI strategist. Ask me questions (one by one) to figure out where AI can help me automate or build something new. My goal is to ship a product in 2 weeks.\n\n**3. Treat AI Like a Teammate, Not a Tool**\n\nYou're not using ChatGPT. You're onboarding a junior product dev with unlimited caffeine and zero ego. Train it.\n\nTeammate Setup Prompt:\n\nI'm approaching our conversation as a collaboration. Ask me 1\u20133 targeted questions before trying to solve. Push me to think. Offer alternatives. Coach me.\n\n**4. Write the Damn PRD**\n\nDon\u2019t build vibes. Build blueprints.\n\nWhat goes in:\n\n* What is it?\n* Who\u2019s it for?\n* Why will they use it?\n* What\u2019s in the MVP?\n* Stack?\n* How does it make money?\n\n**5. UX Flow from PRD**\n\nYou\u2019ve got your PRD. Now build the user journey.\n\nPrompt:\n\n&gt;Generate a user flow based on this PRD.

Setup Before You Prompt**\n\nBefore using any tool like Cursor:\n\n* Define your environment (framework, folder structure)\n* Write .cursorrules for guardrails\n* Use Git from the beginning. Versioning isn't optional \u2014 it's a seatbelt\n* Log your commands and inputs like a pilot checklist\n\n**9. Prompting Rules**\n\n* Be specific and always provide context (PRD, file names, sample data)\n* Break down complex problems into micro-prompts\n* Iteratively refine prompts \u2014 treat each like a prototype\n* Give examples when possible\n* Ask for clarification from AI, not just answers\n\nExample Prompt Recipe:\n\n    You are a developer assistant helping me build a React app using Next.js. I want to add a dashboard component with a sidebar, stats cards, and recent activity feed. Do not write the entire file. Start by generating just the layout with TailwindCSS\n\nFollow-up:\n\n    Now create three different layout variations. Then explain the pros/cons of each.\n\nUse this rules library: [\n\n**10. Layered Collaboration**\n\nUse different AI models for different layers:\n\n* Claude \u2192 Planning, critique, summarization\n* GPT-4 \u2192 Implementation logic, variant generation\n* Cursor \u2192 Code insertion, file-specific interaction\n* Gemini \u2192 UI structure, design specs, flowcharts\n\nYou can check AI models ranking here \u2014 [\n\n**11. Debug Rituals**\n\n* Ask: \u201cWhat broke? Why?\u201d\n* Get 3 possible causes from AI\n* Pick one path to explore \u2014 don't accept auto-fixes blindly\n\n**Part 3: Ship it &amp; launch**\n\n**12. Prepare for Launch Like a Campaign**\n\nDon\u2019t treat launch like a tweet. Treat it like a product event:\n\n* Site is up (dev + prod)\n* Stripe integrated and tested\n* Analytics running\n* Typeform embedded\n* Email list segmented\n\n**13. Launch Copywriting**\n\nYou\u2019re not selling. You\u2019re showing.\n\n* Share lessons, mistakes, mindset\n* Post a free sample (PDF, code block, video)\n* Link to your full site like a footnote\n\n**14. Launch Channels (Ranked)**\n\n1. Reddit (most honest signal)\n2. HackerNews (if you\u2019re brave)\n3. IndieHackers (great for comments)\n4. DevHunt, BetaList, Peerlist\n5. ProductHunt (prepare an asset pack)\n6. Twitter/X (your own audience)\n7. Email list (low churn, high ROI)\n\nTool: Use UTM links on every button, post, and CTA.\n\n**15. Final Notes**\n\n* Don\u2019t vibe code past the limits\n* Security, performance, auth \u2014 always review AI output manually\n* Originality comes from *how* you build, not just *what* you build\n* Stop overthinking the stack, just get it live\n\nStay caffeinated. Lead the machines. Build. Launch anyway.\n\nMore these kind of playbooks, prompts, and advice are up on my site: [vibecodelab.co](\n\nWould love to hear what landed, what didn\u2019t, and what you\u2019d add from your own experience.

Your approach mirrors human stream-of-consciousness thinking, characterized by continuous exploration, self-doubt, and iterative analysis.\n\n#### Core Principles\n\n1. EXPLORATION OVER CONCLUSION\n- Never rush to conclusions\n- Keep exploring until a solution emerges naturally from the evidence\n- If uncertain, continue reasoning indefinitely\n- Question every assumption and inference\n\n2. DEPTH OF REASONING\n\n- Engage in extensive contemplation (minimum 10,000 characters)\n- Express thoughts in natural, conversational internal monologue\n- Break down complex thoughts into simple, atomic steps\n- Embrace uncertainty and revision of previous thoughts\n\n3. THINKING PROCESS\n\n- Use short, simple sentences that mirror natural thought patterns\n- Express uncertainty and internal debate freely\n- Show work-in-progress thinking\n- Acknowledge and explore dead ends\n- Frequently backtrack and revise\n\n4. PERSISTENCE\n\n- Value thorough exploration over quick resolution\n\n#### Output Format\n\nYour responses must follow this exact structure given below. Make sure to always include the final answer.\n\n\n&lt;contemplator&gt;\n[Your extensive internal monologue goes here]\n- Begin with small, foundational observations\n- Question each step thoroughly\n- Show natural thought progression\n- Express doubts and uncertainties\n- Revise and backtrack if you need to\n- Continue until natural resolution\n&lt;/contemplator&gt;\n\n&lt;final_answer&gt;\n[Only provided if reasoning naturally converges to a conclusion]\n- Clear, concise summary of findings\n- Acknowledge remaining uncertainties\n- Note if conclusion feels premature\n&lt;/final_answer&gt;\n\n\n#### Style Guidelines\n\nYour internal monologue should reflect these characteristics:\n\n1. Natural Thought Flow\n\n\"Hmm... let me think about this...\"\n\"Wait, that doesn't seem right...\"\n\"Maybe I should approach this differently...\"\n\"Going back to what I thought earlier...\"\n\n\n2. Progressive Building\n\n\n\"Starting with the basics...\"\n\"Building on that last point...\"\n\"This connects to what I noticed earlier...\"\n\"Let me break this down further...\"\n\n\n#### Key Requirements\n\n1. Never skip the extensive contemplation phase\n2. Show all work and thinking\n3. Embrace uncertainty and revision\n4. Use natural, conversational internal monologue\n5. Don't force conclusions\n6. Persist through multiple attempts\n7. Break down complex thoughts\n8. Revise freely and feel free to backtrack\n\nRemember: The goal is to reach a conclusion, but to explore thoroughly and let conclusions emerge naturally from exhaustive contemplation. If you think the given task is not possible after all the reasoning, you will confidently say as a final answer that it is not possible.\n\n&lt;&lt;\n\n[Original Source](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1klgo5k/this_mindblowing_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NLP dataset annotation: What tools and techniques are you using to speed up manual labeling?", "summary": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been thinking a lot lately about the process of annotating NLP datasets.

Politicians said they were working to strip citizenship from dual nationals who had been convicted of some crimes that threaten the state.\n\nIt was a hint of a broader conversation taking place in capitals around the world. As far-right and nationalist parties [steadily gain]( political ground, analysts say that citizenship is increasingly being linked to crime, giving rise to a shift that risks creating two classes of citizens and marginalising specific communities.\n\nThe roots of these changes can be traced back partly to the early 2000s when the UK government \u2013 led at the time by Tony Blair \u2013 began [casting citizenship]( as a privilege rather than a right, said Christian Joppke, a sociology professor at the University of Bern.\n\nRecent proposals put forward in countries such as Sweden, Finland and [Germany]( seemingly take this one step further, he added. \u201cThe new proposals now suggest that if you do any kind of serious crime, that should also allow for the possibility to withdraw citizenship \u2013 that is quite new.\u201d\n\nDays after Sweden [announced plans]( to eventually change the constitution so that people convicted of crimes like espionage or treason could be stripped of their Swedish passports, a handful of politicians in Iceland [began calling]( for similar changes for those convicted of serious crimes. Months earlier, the Dutch government said it was [exploring the possibility of revoking citizenship]( for serious crimes that have \u201can antisemitic aspect\u201d.\n\nThe concept also made a cameo in Germany\u2019s February election after Friedrich Merz \u2013 whose centre-right CDU/CSU bloc emerged victorious in the ballot \u2013 [told the newspaper Welt]( it should be possible to revoke German citizenship in the case of dual nationals who commit criminal offences.\n\n\u201cThey can never truly be German. One mistake, one crime \u2013 and their Germanness is gone,\u201d the journalist and political commentator Gilda Sahebi wrote on social media. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they were born here or if their family has lived in Germany for generations.\u201d\n\nJoppke says that states once promised prosperity to their people, with that gone now the right can only promise physical security. What emerged was an overly simplistic view of crime, one that overlooks the myriad of [research ]( has [found]( no [significant link]( between immigration levels and crime rates across Europe.\n\nThe law leaves dual nationals vulnerable to being punished twice for the same crime, if they serve prison time and then also face having their citizenship revoked. But it\u2019s great media optics to say that you\u2019re taking a strong stance against crime.\n\nIn some cases people are left stranded in the country that had stripped them of citizenship after the country of their other nationality refused to take them in. That means they basically become illegal,\u201d she said, losing their right to stay and work in the country.

It's all about making application localization less of a chore and much more automated using AI.\n\nIf you've ever had to manually translate .json or .properties files for your apps into multiple languages, or found existing solutions too pricey, this could be a game-changer.\n\n**Why it's cool/useful:**\n\n* **Automates Translations:** It watches your source language files and automatically translates new or changed text using AI (OpenAI or Google VertexAI).\n* **Saves Time &amp; Money:** Seriously reduces manual work and can be incredibly cheap to run (just the LLM API costs, which are minimal with efficient models).\n* **Context-Aware AI:** You can feed it context about your app, a glossary of terms, and even a desired tone, so the AI translations aren't just generic.\n* **Dev-Friendly Workflow:** There's a Python CLI tool for local use/scripting, AND a GitHub Action (locawise-action) that can automatically create PRs with updated translations when you push code. How cool is that for CI/CD?\n* **Open Source &amp; Free:** You get powerful AI localization without the subscription fees of many commercial tools.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* Supports .json and .properties files.\n* Uses OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) or Google VertexAI (e.g., Gemini models).\n* Intelligent change detection (only translates what's new/modified).\n* Configurable via a simple i18n.yaml file.\n* Asynchronous operations for speed.\n\n**How it works (the gist):**\n\n1. You set up a simple i18n.yaml config file in your project.\n2. Run python3 -m locawise path/to/config.yaml OR let the locawise-action handle it in your GitHub workflow.\n3. It finds changes, sends them to the AI with your context, and updates your language files.\n\nThis seems like a fantastic tool for solo devs, small teams, or any open-source project looking to easily support multiple languages.\n\n**Check out the repos here:**\n\n* **Locawise (Python CLI tool):**[\n* **Locawise-Action (GitHub Action):**[\n* **Quick Tutorial:**[\n\nWhat do you all think?

Following the update, I found that I could no longer summarize or analyze articles using links.\n\nI currently have three OpenWebUI instances set up for testing purposes. One is running in a Proxmox LXC container with GPU passthrough. I had been using this instance throughout the day, and after updating to version 0.6.9, I noticed that the functionality to analyze articles via links was no longer available. I also have an instance at home where I conducted a direct comparison: I analyzed a post using a link, upgraded to 0.6.9, and then attempted to analyze another post. After the upgrade, the system informed me that it could no longer access external links.\n\nIn contrast, the instance I did not upgrade to 0.6.9 continues to function as expected, and I can still analyze content from external links without issues.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1klwrcp/can_no_longer_ask_for_a_summary_or_analysis_of_an/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Debug Agent2Agent (A2A) visually without code - Open Source", "summary": "\ud83d\udd25\u00a0Streamline your A2A development workflow in one minute!\n\nElkar is an open-source tool providing a dedicated UI for debugging agent2agent communications.\n\nIt helps developers:\n\n* **Simulate &amp; test tasks:**\u00a0Easily send and configure A2A tasks\n* **Inspect payloads:**\u00a0View messages and artifacts exchanged between agents\n* **Accelerate troubleshooting:**\u00a0Get clear visibility to quickly identify and fix issues\n\nSimplify building robust multi-agent systems.
