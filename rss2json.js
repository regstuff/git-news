It exhaustively considers all possible cases and correctly identifies the allowed values of kkk as 0, 1, and 3.\n* **Score:** 7 out of 7 (full marks)\n* **Justification:** The solution first handles the case n=3n = 3n=3 and proves that only k=0,1,3k = 0, 1, 3k=0,1,3 are possible. It then generalizes this via induction for arbitrary nnn, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions. It successfully constructs configurations that yield exactly 0, 1, or 3 sunny lines while logically proving that no other values are possible. Thus, under the official IMO marking scheme, this complete and rigorous reasoning merits a full score.\n\n# Problem 2\n\n* **Accuracy Assessment:** The solution is fully correct. It rigorously proves that the given line is tangent to a circle by defining multiple auxiliary points and proving key geometric claims.\n* **Score:** 7 out of 7 (full marks)\n* **Justification:** The solution deduces relationships such as CE\u2225ADCE \\\\parallel ADCE\u2225AD and DF\u2225ACDF \\\\parallel ACDF\u2225AC, constructs point TTT to demonstrate tangency, and considers the role of the foot HHH from triangle PMNPMNPMN. All necessary geometric lemmas (such as parallel angle properties and incenter/excenter behaviors) are properly applied to reach the conclusion. The logical flow is tight, with no gaps or unjustified leaps. Therefore, this solution should be awarded full marks.\n\n# Problem 3\n\n* **Accuracy Assessment:** The solution is perfectly correct. It rigorously analyzes constraints implied by the function's definition and correctly identifies the minimal constant c=4c = 4c=4.\n* **Score:** 7 out of 7 (full marks)\n* **Justification:** The solution shows that for all bonza functions, f(n)\u22644nf(n) \\\\leq 4nf(n)\u22644n, establishing c=4c = 4c=4 as an upper bound. It then constructs a specific function (e.g., with f(4)=16f(4) = 16f(4)=16) to demonstrate that this bound is tight and that any smaller value would violate the conditions. It uses key properties such as odd primes being forced to map to 1, and limits on powers of 2 in the range of f(n)f(n)f(n). With precise arguments and no missing steps, this complete solution fully satisfies IMO criteria and deserves a full score.\n\n# Problem 4\n\n* **Accuracy Assessment:** This is a complete and correct solution. It precisely characterizes all valid initial values a1a\\_1a1\u200b of the infinite sequence satisfying the given condition, namely values of the form a1=12e\u22c56\u22c5\u2113a\\_1 = 12\\^e \\\\cdot 6 \\\\cdot \\\\ella1\u200b=12e\u22c56\u22c5\u2113 where gcd\u2061(\u2113,10)=1\\\\gcd(\\\\ell, 10) = 1gcd(\u2113,10)=1, and proves that other forms are invalid.\n* **Score:** 7 out of 7 (full marks)\n* **Justification:** The solution proves both necessity and sufficiency. It shows that only initial values of the stated form yield sequences where each term has at most two distinct positive divisors. For example, it analyzes modulo behavior to exclude numbers not divisible by 2 or 3. Any a1a\\_1a1\u200b that includes disallowed prime factors eventually generates a term with at least three distinct divisors, violating the problem's condition. The reasoning is complete and precise, with no omissions, qualifying it for full credit.\n\n# Problem 5\n\n* **Accuracy Assessment:** The solution is entirely correct. It thoroughly analyzes both players\u2019 strategies and correctly determines the critical threshold \u03bb=12\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\u03bb=2\u200b1\u200b, showing that Alice wins when \u03bb&gt;12\\\\lambda &gt; \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\u03bb&gt;2\u200b1\u200b, while Bazza wins when \u03bb&lt;12\\\\lambda &lt; \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\u03bb&lt;2\u200b1\u200b. It also accounts for the boundary case.\n* **Score:** 7 out of 7 (full marks)\n* **Justification:** The solution provides concrete strategies for both players depending on the value of \u03bb\\\\lambda\u03bb. For \u03bb\u226512\\\\lambda \\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\u03bb\u22652\u200b1\u200b, Alice avoids defeat by consistently choosing 0 and can eventually block Bazza. For \u03bb&gt;12\\\\lambda &gt; \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\u03bb&gt;2\u200b1\u200b, she ensures victory. Conversely, for \u03bb\u226412\\\\lambda \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\u03bb\u22642\u200b1\u200b, Bazza has a strategy to indefinitely continue the game, guaranteeing his win. The solution carefully analyzes the boundary case where neither player can force a win. As it covers all cases without error, it merits full marks.\n\n# Total Score and Medal Estimate\n\n**Total Score:** 35 points (out of a maximum of 42, as only Problems 1\u20135 are evaluated)\n\n**Predicted Medal:** Gold Medal \ud83e\udd47 \u2013 According to typical IMO cutoffs, a gold medal is usually awarded for scores of 35 and above. Therefore, with a score of 35, this student is projected to receive a gold medal. (Official IMO 2025 medal cutoffs were: Gold \u2265 35, Silver \u2265 28, Bronze \u2265 19.)\n\n\n\n\n\n Contact : [lemoaxtoria@gmail.com](mailto:lemoaxtoria@gmail.com)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1maute6/ive_brought_a_verifiable_prompt_for_imo_2025_i/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prompt pour cr\u00e9er une IA qui voit ton avenir (et t\u2019aide \u00e0 ne pas le foirer) \u2013 ChatGPT", "summary": "voila une IA qui anticipe les cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles de tes d\u00e9cisions, mois par mois, sans flou artistique ni bullshit de coach.  \nTu veux d\u00e9m\u00e9nager ?
