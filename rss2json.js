What are my alternatives? (Emergency! please advise)", "summary": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m a queer student from India, and I\u2019m currently at a difficult academic and personal crossroads. I\u2019ve recently been offered admission to the MA in Computational Linguistics program at The English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad, for the 2025\u20132026 session. While the opportunity felt like a major step forward, I\u2019m beginning to second guess the long term value of this path, especially given my goals and circumstances.\n\nMy Background:\n\n\u2022 I hold a BA in English Literature, with sufficient credits in Linguistics.\n\n\u2022 I would have majored in Linguistics, but the university I attended simply did not have the infrastructure or faculty to offer it as a standalone major.\n\n\u2022 I come from a low-income background with no financial or emotional support from family. I\u2019ve been living independently and have limited means.\n\n\u2022 I am queer, and it\u2019s critical for me to find an academic/professional future that allows me to eventually move abroad; both for better career opportunities and to live more openly and safely.\n\nThe Program at EFLU:\n\n\u2022 EFLU is well known in India for language studies, but the Computational Linguistics department reportedly has just two faculty members; one experienced but overloaded, and another with questionable subject expertise.\n\n\u2022 The program appears theoretically sound, but lacks substantial technical training, especially in programming, machine learning, or real-world NLP tools.\n\n\u2022 The degree is an MA, not an MSc, and may not offer much in terms of practical coding experience or portfolio development.\n\nI am passionate about CompLing, but I\u2019m concerned this program will not give me the skills, exposure, or credibility needed to pursue higher studies or work abroad; especially in competitive NLP programs or roles. While I\u2019m willing to self learn (coding, GitHub, MOOCs, etc.), I don\u2019t know if that alone will compensate for institutional limitations.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nQuestions I\u2019m Hoping to Get Guidance On:\n\nA. EFLU and Similar Programs\n\n\u2022 Is an MA in CompLing from a theoretically strong but technically limited institution like EFLU still worth it?\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019ve studied here or know people who have: How was the placement, skill-building, or research exposure?\n\n\u2022How important is faculty support in the early stages of a career in CL/NLP?\n\n\u2022Would self-learning and building an external portfolio make up for a weak institutional base?\n\n\u2022Do Indian programs like this still carry any brand value internationally, or is the degree essentially a formality?\n\n\u2022If you\u2019re in academia/industry, would you consider hiring or admitting someone with a literature + self-taught NLP background but limited formal technical training?\n\nB. Transitioning from Non-Tech Backgrounds\n\nFor those who entered NLP/CL from humanities backgrounds:\n\n\u2022 What helped you bridge the gap?\n\u2022 Was a formal CS degree always required, or did projects/certifications do the trick?\n\u2022 How did you gain credibility with international grad schools or employers?\n\nC. Alternative Paths; Would These Be Better?\n\n\u2022Should I skip the program and spend the next 12\u201315 months building a strong tech portfolio (Python, NLP, GitHub, Kaggle, online certs), and apply to better-funded MSc/MA programs abroad in 2026 (e.g., Erasmus Mundus, DAAD, Australia, etc.)?\n\t\n\u2022I also have the option to do a fourth year under the FYUGP system, converting my BA into a BA (Hons) in English Literature, which would buy me more time to study and plan. Would this be a smarter detour if I\u2019m aiming for funded international options?\n\n\u2022Or should I still go ahead with EFLU, attend the classes, self-study rigorously on the side, and try for good outcomes anyway?\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhat Matters to Me:\n\n\u2022A future where I can work and live abroad without hiding who I am.\n\n\u2022A program that provides technical rigor, either through institutional support or the flexibility to build it myself.\n\n\u2022Not wasting time or money on a degree that won\u2019t actually move me forward.\n\n\u2022Mental health: I\u2019ve lived independently for 3 years, and hostel life in a conservative setup is hard for someone queer.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nAny experiences, insights, or blunt advice; even criticism; would help me enormously right now. I just don\u2019t want to make a move that closes more doors than it opens.\n\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1lrfd92/queer_student_from_india_pursuing_an_ma_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nanonets OCR, THUDM GLM-4 bug fixes + DeepSeek Chimera v2", "summary": "Hey guys!
