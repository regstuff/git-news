Kashmir - namely that the situation is out of control, governance failure, army failure etc. I have analyzed that in some detail in a previous blog post on Kashmir, including being critical   \nof policy decisions and lapses in governance and concluded that the insurgency is under control and unsustainable for Pakistan (not India).   \nTo the best of my knowledge however, while militancy in Pakistan is reported, the mainstream media has NOT done a simple comparison of data between Kashmir and militancy affected parts of Pak, so I did it.\n\nIn summary, Pak is far worse. Not just in the numbers killed, but the effectiveness of the  \nPak army in controlling it (kill ratios). Even though they don't face state sponsored terrorism. I also point out discrepancies in numbers from Pak.  \nEven Karachi lost more people from terrorism than Kashmir.\n\nThe point is not to say, \\they are worse off than us', but validates a post I made earlier, that financial compulsions and the need to have a large portion of the Pak army on counter insurgency had led the Pak army to agree to a ceasefire on the LOC in Jan 21, at a time when the Indian army was under pressure from China in Ladakh and militant groups needed the Pak army to revive terrorism in Kashmir after the abrogation of article 370.  \nDespite insurgency in Pakistan not being state sponsored, their losses are far worse and  \ntheir army more stretched in fighting it. \n\n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1hj1clk/pakistans_terrorism_problem/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Boardgame.io: an engine for creating turn-based games using JavaScript (github.com/boardgameio)", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/boardgameio/boardgame.io", "author": "None"}, {"title": "U\u0405 lifts $10m bounty on HTS leader after talks in Syrian capital - In face-to-face meeting, Ahmed al-Sharaa gave assurances IS would not be allowed to operate in Syria, U\u0405 official says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/us-lifts-10m-bounty-on-hts-leader-ahmed-al-sharaa-syria-talks", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Taylor Swift Donates $250,000 to Kansas City Educational Center", "summary": "", "link": "https://globalbenefit.co.uk/taylor-swift-donates-250000-to-kansas-city-educational-center/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Could the '08 Mumbai Attack Have Been Prevented?
