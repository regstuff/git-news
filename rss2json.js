It is both challenging and rewarding. What will it bring to mankind if machines replaces these bright idealists? I thought the idea behind AI was that it would help us achieve efficiency gains by taking over tedious, repetitive tasks from us so that we would have more time for creative tasks. That's the way I use AI, and I find it useful in that respect.
