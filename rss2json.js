Over time, they\u2019ve created an overwhelming number of segments. Segments, as the name suggests, allow analysts to break down large datasets based on specific characteristics. For example, a segment might be titled:\n\n\u201cNortheast Region - Grill Sales - December/November\u201d\n\nThis title would be followed by the logic defining how the segmentation occurs.\n\nThe issue is that there\u2019s no standard naming convention for these segments. Using the example above, someone else might name a similar segment:\n\u201cBBQ Sales for Northeast - November/December Delivery\u201d\n\nMy goal is to identify segments with similar titles and group them effectively.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve Done So Far:\n\t1.\tStandardized Terminology:\n\t\u2022\tReplaced synonyms (e.g., changing \u201cBBQ\u201d to \u201cGrill\u201d).\n\t\u2022\tLowercased all text and removed special characters for consistency.\n\t2.\tUsed a Sentence Transformer:\n\t\u2022\tApplied the Multilingual BERT (MBERT) model to analyze and compare\n\nHowever I am stuck, I assumed the sentence transformer would be able to create embedding based on similar meaning, however the perfect matches are literally only ones that are word for word matching\u2026does anyone have any suggestions?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1h8fg3o/is_a_sentence_transformer_the_right_approach_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spain to enshrine gay marriage and abortion rights into its constitution so 'they cannot be undone in the future' ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2024/12/06/spain-to-enshrine-gay-marriage-and-abortion-rights-into-its-constitution-so-they-cannot-be-undone-in-the-future/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia's 'meat-grinder' tactics bring battlefield success - but at horrendous cost", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ewneynypwo.amp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin lauds Modi\u2019s \u2018India First\u2019 policy, says Russia will invest in India", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/putin-modi-russia-investment-make-in-india-9708431/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yoon apologizes over declaring martial law ahead of impeachment vote", "summary": "", "link": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-12-07/national/politics/Yoon-apologizes-over-declaring-martial-law-ahead-of-impeachment-vote/2195047", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'Israel is a key ally in our national security,' India's foreign minister says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.jpost.com/international/article-832142", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u0421hinese Fishing Vessel Hijacked by Pirates in Somali Waters", "summary": "", "link": "https://us500.com/news/articles/2024-12/chinese-vessel-hijacked", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Georgian PM vows to 'eradicate liberal fascism' amid crackdown on pro-EU protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241205-georgian-pm-vows-to-eradicate-opposition-amid-pro-eu-protests", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is getting a master\u2019s in archaeology in Europe worth it?", "summary": "I have a BA in philology and no experience with archaeology.
