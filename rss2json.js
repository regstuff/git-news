This is really expensive and consumes lots of capital without generating new capital. That is fine when young people greatly outnumbers old people, but once that reality is reversed, the wheels fall off.\n\nFrom 2000 until 2023\u00a0[per capita healthcare costs in Germany went up by 180%](\u00a0while\u00a0[GDP grew by 130%](\u00a0in the same period. And the German population grew by about 1 million people in that span of  time, which should have helped to dilute the cost per capita of the healthcare. And I am talking just about healthcare costs, not pensions. And healthcare costs are expected to increase by a lot more as the population ages while GDP is expected to stay stagnant.\n\n# [German welfare state 'can no longer be financed' \u2014 Merz](\n\nIt was a matter of time. The inverted demographic pyramid, the anemic economic growth over the past several years and the fact that the US can no longer be counted as a security guarantor made the current model unsustainable. Of course the AfD blames the issue on immigrants and promises that once the \"brownies\" are kicked out, the German Welfare State will be \"great again\".\n\nThis same scenario is playing across all of Europe.\n\nMost people, governments and institutions are OK with the notion of a gradual and controlled population decline. What is alarming people is the pace of the decline we are witnessing and its impact of the composition of the demographic pyramid. When birthrates fall off a cliff, as we are seeing now, we end up with a massively large old population that needs to be supported by an ever declining young population. We don't know how to run a society with more retirees than working people, or with more sickly people than healthy ones. In the entire history of humanity, this scenario has never happened.
