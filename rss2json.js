But this is not about religion. This is about three politically fragile states trying to stay relevant by backing each other\u2019s delusions.\n\nEach member of this so-called brotherhood is a case study in democratic decay. Pakistan is a military puppet show. Turkey is a strongman state where dissent has been criminalised. Azerbaijan is a thinly veiled monarchy ruled by the same family for decades. None of them has a functioning democratic system or a credible reputation internationally.\n\nWhat unites them is failure. They feed their populations a steady diet of nationalism to cover up domestic incompetence. Pakistan talks endlessly about Kashmir while its economy collapses. Turkey talks about Islamic unity while jailing journalists. Azerbaijan waves war flags to distract from corruption and repression.\n\nTogether, they manufacture theatre. They conduct joint military drills, issue coordinated statements and celebrate each other\u2019s pet causes. Turkey cheers Pakistan on Kashmir. Pakistan refuses to recognise Armenia. Azerbaijan returns the favour at international forums. This is not strategy. It is mutual self-delusion.\n\nBut there is a more serious dimension. China quietly benefits from this toxic triangle. These three provide a soft buffer that helps Beijing undermine India\u2019s influence, obstruct international consensus, and insert pressure points across South and Central Asia. The longer this alliance appears united, the easier it is for China to play behind the curtain.\n\nThis so-called trinity is not inevitable. It can be challenged. With firm regional partnerships, tighter diplomatic messaging, and public exposure of their hypocrisy, their fragile posturing can be punctured. India, along with its allies, needs to stop treating them as noisy irritants and start showing them as the hollow actors they are.\n\nThis is not a coalition of strength. It is a confederation of crutches.
