Official accounts from the Indian [Ministry of External Affairs]( (MEA) and the [Indian Embassy in Phnom Penh]( continue to place the start of these ties in 1952, even though Cambodia was still under French colonial control until November 9, 1953, and even though the late respected scholar Dr. D.R. SarDesai in his seminal work on Indo-Indochinese relations firmly dates the formal recognition to December 31, 1954, one day after the purported abrogation of the Pau Agreements (1950).\n\n**The Discrepancy and Its Roots**\n\nSarDesai\u2019s research in,\u00a0*Indian Foreign Policy in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, 1947\u20131964*, indicates that India did not extend formal diplomatic recognition to Cambodia until **31 December 1954**, one day after the \u201cPau Agreements\u201d were purportedly abrogated. It is likely in the context of that day that Jawaharlal Nehru\u2014publicly committed to the process of decolonization\u2014would not have recognized Cambodia prior to that date since the country was still legally tied to France. Yet, official MEA statements and even celebratory events, such as the June 21, 2022 event in Phnom Penh marking the so-called 70th anniversary from 1952, fail to explain why India would have recognized Cambodia before it was independent.\n\nThe mismatch raises uncomfortable questions:\n\n* Did anyone in the MEA verify these dates, or are such pronouncements made without consulting the national archives?\n* If the archives were indeed consulted, why is the well-documented 1954 recognition date, attested by SarDesai and corroborated by Cambodia\u2019s political trajectory, ignored? Why wasn't there any additional context provided.\n\n[Jawaharlal Nehru meets Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former king at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh \\(October 1954\\)](\n\n**The Realpolitik Angle: French India and Nehru\u2019s Balancing Act**\n\nA plausible explanation emerges when one looks at the broader colonial context. At the time, France still held five enclaves in India (Pondicherry, Chandernagore, Karikal, Mah\u00e9, and Yanam), with negotiations for their handover dragging on from 1947 until November 1, 1954. France feared that relinquishing its Indian possessions too early would embolden decolonization movements in its more valuable colonies in Indochina.\n\n* **Procrastination**: France systematically delayed transferring the enclaves from 1947 until\u00a0*after*\u00a0the July 21, 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina. This delay was largely driven by strategic considerations, as the French enclaves in India served as leverage and logistical staging grounds to maintain their colonial influence over the more valuable territories in Indochina.\n* **Shift in French Position**: The French defeat in Indochina made them more amenable to abandoning their enclaves in India, culminating in an agreement in September 1954 to consult with elected representatives of French India on the question of transfer of territory.\n* **Transfer of Power**: On October 18, 1954, French India\u2019s elected representatives approved merger with India. The formal handover took place on November 1, 1954, effectively the same day Nehru returned from Cambodia.\n\nBy not recognizing Cambodia prematurely, Nehru was likely engaging in a careful balancing act: publicly championing anti-colonialism while quietly avoiding a diplomatic standoff with France, which still held territory in India. Recognizing Cambodia while French forces remained entrenched both in Indochina and on Indian soil would have jeopardized delicate negotiations over Pondicherry and the other French enclaves.\n\n**The Pau Agreements: Abrogation or Irrelevance?**\n\nSarDesai maintains that India recognized Cambodia immediately after the abrogation of the Pau Agreements, i.e., on December 31, 1954. Yet other sources do not explicitly reference any \u201cformal\u201d abrogation date. The Pau Agreements might simply have become\u00a0irrelevant after the July 21, 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina. It is possible that the\u00a0French themselves\u00a0considered the agreements abrogated by December, whereas available academic archives that I have looked into are silent on a specific date.\n\nRegardless, SarDesai\u2019s account\u2014backed by the logic of post-Geneva decolonization\u2014makes it unlikely that India would have extended diplomatic recognition in 1952, when Cambodia was still a French protectorate.\n\n**The MEA\u2019s Present-Day Oversight**\n\nDespite this evidence, the MEA and the Indian Embassy continue to cite 1952 as the official start of Indo-Cambodian ties. At a grand ceremony in June 2022, [dignitaries unveiled a commemorative logo and repeated the 1952 narrative]( The former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Rajkumar Ranjan Singh, was also present. No context was provided regarding French colonial presence in Cambodia or India\u2019s own vulnerability to French pressure at the time. Nor is there an official explanation for why Nehru or any other senior official only visited Cambodia in late 1954\u2014if, in fact, diplomatic ties had existed since 1952.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder whether these essential archival records are languishing in government vaults\u2014unexamined, neglected, or possibly lost\u2014or if they were never maintained at the MEA at all and removed by former officials?  Equally plausible is the possibility that the MEA, whether out of sheer convenience or the sluggish grind of bureaucracy, simply couldn\u2019t be bothered to correct this laughably wrong date, betraying the disdain they truly harbor for this diplomatic tie.\n\n**A Quick Refresher**: In 1970, a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Cambodia ousted Prince Norodom Sihanouk, replacing him with a pro-American regime led by General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. From 1975 to 1979, Cambodia endured the genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge, a Maoist regime backed by China, during which approximately 2 million people perished. In 1979, Vietnamese forces overthrew the Khmer Rouge, establishing a new regime. By 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Paris Peace Agreements were signed, with India playing a significant role in peacekeeping efforts. A new constitution was adopted in 1993, paving the way for a civil government and Cambodia\u2019s gradual recovery.\n\nNeedless to say, Cambodia lost much of its historical state records during these years of turmoil, further complicating its efforts to rebuild and reclaim its past.\n\n**Recent Ambassadorial Notes and Unfinished Business**\n\nEven recent developments hint at a lack of consistent engagement. Outgoing Ambassador Devyani Khobragade, in her farewell meeting with Cambodia\u2019s Senate President Hun Sen, described her four-year stint as \u201c[successful]( citing improved connectivity (direct flights between Phnom Penh and New Delhi) and cooperation on various fronts. Yet, observers of the diplomatic ties might remain unconvinced, pointing to unresolved issues like [large-scale human trafficking and cyber scams]( that proliferated during her tenure.\n\nHer successor, Joint Secretary [Bawitlung Vanlalvawna]( now inherits a relationship that\u2014on paper\u2014spans 70-plus years yet is riddled with inaccuracies about its official inception date. At a deeper level, however, many Cambodian officials still recall that India was one of the very few non-communist states to recognize the Heng Samrin regime in the 1980s, demonstrating New Delhi\u2019s capacity for both principled and pragmatic engagement.\n\n**Reclaiming Historical Accuracy**\n\nFor all practical purposes, the\u00a070th anniversary\u00a0of India\u2019s diplomatic relations with Cambodia should occur on\u00a0December 31, 2024, not 2022. If the MEA seeks to demonstrate genuine respect for Cambodia and its Southeast Asian partners\u2014particularly those with which it shares civilizational ties\u2014it should address these discrepancies head-on.\n\nIndia\u2019s cautious stance in the early 1950s was a calculated decision made under Nehru\u2019s watch, reflecting the\u00a0realpolitik\u00a0of French colonial enclaves in India and the complexities of Indochina\u2019s decolonization. Today, however, continuing to cite 1952 without context suggests not so much a grand design as\u00a0bureaucratic neglect\u2014an irony that does no favors to India\u2019s stated objective of deepening ties with Cambodia and the broader region.\n\n**A Call for Historical Clarity**\n\nIn the end, a definitive understanding of when India truly extended diplomatic recognition to Cambodia ought to be more than a bureaucratic footnote. It is a reminder that India\u2019s relationship with Southeast Asia\u2014especially with nations sharing ancient civilizational ties\u2014deserves better than cursory references to dubious \u201c1952\u201d origins. A thorough re-examination of archival material, combined with an honest acknowledgment of the reasons that shaped Nehru\u2019s decisions, is long overdue.\n\nSarDesai, D. R. (1968).\u00a0*Indian foreign policy in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, 1947\u20131964*. University of California Press, pp. 64\u201365.\n\n&gt;On the diplomatic plane, the Indian efforts were, however, hampered in the beginning by a lack of any diplomatic representation in Phnom Penh or Vientiane. At the time of the Geneva Conference, none of the Associated States of Indochina had been recognized by India, although the existing consular representation in Saigon and Hanoi was continued. With the Geneva settlement granting independence to Cambodia, the latter had expected immediate recogition from India, which would help Cambodia secure recognition from other Asian and African countries.\u00a0Such expectation was belied, and the Cambodian delegation to the preliminary conference of the ICC in New Delhi in August, 1954, openly expressed its resentment in the matter. The delegation regretted that India had forgotten that Cambodia \"belonged to the great Indian civilization.\"\u00a0The delay in Indian recognition was caused by some legal quibbling in the External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi, where the view prevailed that until the quadripartite Pau Agreements of 1950,\u00a0limiting the economic and financial independence of the Indochinese states, were abrogated, the Indochinese states could not be deemed to have attained complete independence. When Nehru stopped in Phnom Penh on his return journey from China in November, 1954, the Cambodian premier drew the visitor's attention to the absence of diplomatic ties with India. There were profuse references to ancient cultural contacts between India and Cambodia in all the speeches from both sides during the visit. Nehru himself seemed to have been moved considerably by the visual impression of India's cultural impact on the country. Cambodian hospitality, the countryside, and the magnificent monuments at Angkor struck responsive chords in Nehru, who told the Indian troops serving the ICC that \"every blade of grass on either side of the road breathed Indian culture.\"\u00a0**One of the direct results of this visit and the cultural reminders on the occasion was the sudden Indian decision to single out Cambodia from among the Indochinese states for some kind of recognition. Accordingly, B. K. Acharya was sent to Cambodia to head a special mission with the personal rank of minister. Formal recognition of Cambodia and Laos followed on December 31, 1954,\u00a0a day after the Pau Agreements were abrogated.**\u00a0\\[...\\] (emphasis mine)\n\nOther references:\n\n* Yechury, A.

My advisor says that it is okay to work with less data as the duration of the thesis is only 1 year and spending too much time collecting or creating data is not good. I'm fine working with only 15 or 20 video interviews and about 10 transcripts. The bigger problem is WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS? Like I am unable to visualize what the end goal would look like.\n\nAny advice on what can be done and any resources that might help me get a direction are highly appreciated.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1hmwr74/help_regarding_an_ms_thesis_in_nlp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u201cThey buried him among the kings because he had done good toward God and toward his house.\u201d The coffin of the Unknown Warrior, a tribute to British and Commonwealth troops with no known grave, before its interment at Westminster Abbey on November 11, 1920.", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/zm0xp2pjba9e1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India\u2019s cross-border railway network must reflect \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 policy", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/opinion/indias-cross-border-railway-network-reflect-its-neighbourhood-first-policy/2419465/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - evoluteur/react-crud-icons: 67 SVG icons for CRUD applications, packaged as a React component with light &amp; dark themes and tooltip.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/evoluteur/react-crud-icons", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Budget 2025: Can Sitharaman and co help India turn into a semiconductor superpower? - The Economic Times", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2025-can-sitharaman-and-co-help-india-turn-into-a-semiconductor-superpower/articleshow/116679703.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China plans world's largest dam on Brahmaputra: How will it impact India | India News - Times of India", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-plans-worlds-largest-dam-on-brahmaputra-how-will-it-impact-india/articleshow/116682819.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NATO ready to help Finland after cable 'sabotage'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2024/1226/1488168-finland-outages/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh-Pakistan thaw to redraw South Asia's power map", "summary": "", "link": "https://asiatimes.com/2024/12/bangladesh-pakistan-thaw-to-redraw-south-asias-power-map/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New York to fine fossil fuel companies $75 billion under new climate law", "summary": "Make polluters pay, not tax payers.
