The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters\u2019 relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.\n\nIn past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-crackdown-arrests-9de7c65d17920dc43568d3f025fed2cd", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Alexei Navalny died after being poisoned with dart frog toxin, UK and allies say", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/navalny-died-after-being-poisoned-with-dart-frog-toxin-13507402", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Overcrowding in Swiss prisons reaches critical levels", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/various/overcrowding-in-swiss-prisons-reaches-critical-levels/90946709", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hundreds of thousands gather in Munich demanding regime change in Iran amid ongoing protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/2026/02/14/hundreds-of-thousands-gather-in-munich-demanding-regime-change-in-iran-amid-ongoing-protes", "author": "None"}, {"title": "African Union summit clouded by Saudi-UAE rivalry in Horn of Africa", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/african-union-summit-clouded-by-saudi-uae-rivalry-horn-africa-2026-02-14/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish president vetoes law recognising Silesian as regional language in Poland", "summary": "President Karol Nawrocki has vetoed a bill that would have recognised Silesian \u2013 which is spoken by hundreds of thousands of people from the historical area of Silesia in southwest Poland \u2013 as an official regional language.\n\nNawrocki argued that linguists consider Silesian to be a dialect rather than a separate language. He also said that he would not support any measures \u201cthat may create artificial divisions in our national community\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s veto, which had been expected, marks a second failed attempt by the ruling coalition to recognise Silesian as a regional language. A previous bill to that effect was in 2024\u00a0[vetoed](\u00a0by then-President Andrzej Duda, who like Nawrocki is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nIn the\u00a0[most recent national census]( around 460,000 people in Poland said they use Silesian as their main tongue at home. That is far more than the 87,600 who speak\u00a0[Kashubian]( a language native to northern Poland that is currently the country\u2019s only recognised regional language.\n\nSuch official recognition allows a language to be taught in schools and used in local administration in municipalities where at least 20% of the population declared in the last census that they speak it. It also provides additional funding for preserving the language.\n\nWhile many linguists have traditionally viewed Silesian as a dialect of Polish, a growing number now argue that it is becoming a language in its own right. They point to its increasing standardisation, expanding body of literature and\u00a0[wider everyday use](\n\nDuring work on the bill, Katarzyna K\u0142osi\u0144ska, chair of the Council for the Polish Language, told lawmakers that circumstances have changed significantly since her council\u2019s opinion helped classify Silesian as a dialect in 2011.\n\n\u201cAt that time, the language or ethnolect was far less standardised. There was little literature, and fewer people saw it as their native, family or home language,\u201d she said, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nShe also noted that, when Kashubian was granted regional language status in 2005, it was less standardised and had less literature and cultural presence than Silesian has today. For that reason, she argued, Silesian should also qualify for legal recognition.\n\nNawrocki, however, has rejected that position. \u201cWe need to listen to what specialists say on this matter. Experts and linguists point out that Silesian is a dialect of Polish. We cannot create a precedent in which a political majority decides academic matters,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president added that he \u201cwill not agree to solutions that could create artificial divisions within our national community\u201d. Conservatives in Poland have long warned that some Silesian activists are seeking autonomy for their region from Poland.\n\nHowever, Nawrocki emphasised that he \u201crespects and greatly values Silesian tradition and culture\u201d and would sign separate legislation, which has been submitted to parliament, supporting Silesian culture and dialect.\n\nSimilar arguments were used by Duda to justify his veto in 2024. He said that Silesian is not a language and even claimed that recognising it could threaten Poland\u2019s security by undermining national identity.\n\nThose claims have, however, been rejected by figures from the centrist Civic Coalition (KO), Poland\u2019s main ruling party.\n\n\u201cRecognising Silesian does not threaten the unity of the state,\u201d said Danuta Jaz\u0142owiecka, a KO MP from Silesia, in January, when\u00a0[parliament approved the bill]( \u201cOn the contrary, it strengthens it, showing that the republic is a community that is open, respecting its internal richness and diversity.\u201d\n\nNawrocki\u2019s veto drew anger from another Silesian KO politician, MEP \u0141ukasz Kochut, who told PAP that \u201cthe president spat in the face of hundreds of thousands of Silesians..\\[and\\] behaved like a complete prick\u201d, using a Silesian expletive \u201cciul\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/13/polish-president-vetoes-law-recognising-silesian-as-regional-language-in-poland/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "America offers Europe warmer words, but a deep chill remains", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2026/02/14/america-offers-europe-warmer-words-but-a-deep-chill-remains", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish parliament approves \u20ac44bn EU defence loans despite opposition criticism", "summary": "The government\u2019s majority in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, has approved a bill that would allow Poland to receive almost \u20ac44 billion (185 billion zloty) in loans through the European Union to fund defence spending.\n\nHowever, the right-wing opposition voted against the legislation, arguing that the funds would leave Poland more dependent upon Brussels. The bill still faces a potential veto from opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, who already voiced concern over the loans.\n\nThe funds are part of the EU\u2019s SAFE programme, which is offering \u20ac150 billion in loans to help member states boost defence spending. Poland has been\u00a0[assigned by far the largest share]( at \u20ac43.7 billion. The EU Council is set to give final approval for the funds next week.\n\nThe government says the loans are at highly preferential rates and will strengthen national security at a time of growing threats on Poland\u2019s eastern borders. They also say that over 80% of the funds will be spent domestically, bolstering the Polish defence industry.\n\nOn Wednesday this week, the government submitted a bill to parliament that would facilitate the receipt and spending of the SAFE loans. A key element of the legislation is the creation of a special financial instrument managed by Poland\u2019s National Development Bank (BGK), through which the money will be channelled.\n\nFor Poland to access the funds as planned, the law must enter into force by March 2026, when Warsaw plans to sign a loan agreement with the European Commission.\n\nOn Friday, the government\u2019s bill passed with a majority of 236 votes in the Sejm \u2013 which mainly came from the ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre right \u2013 and 199 against, mainly from the opposition national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) and the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja).\n\nOn Thursday, PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski had announced his opposition to the SAFE programme, which he said would lead to \u201cmany years of financial dependence on a catalogue of products specified by the European Commission\u201d.\n\nHe also claimed that it would open up Poland to \u201cpolitical blackmail\u201d because \u201cthe EU has the right to suspend payments at any time, and there are no legal guarantees that the money will go to the Polish arms industry\u201d.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Donald Tusk criticised the opposition after the vote, writing that PiS and Confederation had voted \u201cagainst Poland\u2019s security, against a modern army, against the Polish arms industry\u201d. They are \u201cno longer the opposition; they are enemies of Polish independence\u201d, he declared.\n\nThe bill now passes to the upper-house Senate, where the government also has a majority. The Senate cannot block legislation but can suggest amendments to it, which are then accepted or rejected by the Sejm.\n\nOnce the legislation is given final approval by parliament, it passes to President Nawrocki, who has already\u00a0[voiced concern](\u00a0about the loans.\n\n\u201cThere are increasing signs, including from abroad, that the SAFE programme is primarily designed to benefit the largest western European arms manufacturers, rather than countries that are still building their defence capabilities and are closest to armed conflict, such as Poland,\u201d he said this week.\n\nBoth PiS and Nawrocki\u2019s chancellery have also warned that the programme could damage relations with the United States because most of the loans must be spent on European equipment, whereas up until now Poland has relied in large part on American supplies.\n\nSpeaking after today\u2019s vote, defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that he was \u201cdisappointed with the attitude of the opposition, which does not want a strong Poland, a strong Polish army, or a strong Polish arms industry\u201d, reports news service Defence24.\n\nKosiniak-Kamysz said that, in order to assuage some of the opposition\u2019s \u201cmisguided\u201d concerns, amendments to the bill would be added in the Senate, including ensuring that the SAFE loan repayments were not included in the defence ministry\u2019s budget.\n\nHe also said that a list of potential purchases with the SAFE funds, something the opposition has been demanding, would soon be made more widely available. One such project that has already been announced is a\u00a0[new anti-drone system](\u00a0that will be produced by Polish and Norwegian firms.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/13/polish-parliament-approves-e44bn-eu-defence-loans-despite-opposition-criticism/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
