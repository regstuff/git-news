Right now my stack is pretty simple. I'm using gemini for both transcription of audio from the user and as well as generating the text response (I give it a prompt to transcribe and then respond in text form to the audio). The text response is fed through a text to speech engine. Currently using speechify for that.\n\nThe problem I'm having is latency. When I include audio for gemini to transcribe with my request it shoots up from \\~400ms of latency to \\~1.2s of latency. I then need to feed that to a text to speech engine. Right now the multilingual mode of speechify gives me an extra \\~1.3s of latency. I've tried elevenlabs and I can get around \\~400-600ms of latency, however it's very expensive.\n\nI should clarify when I say latency for each part, I'm using the streaming endpoints of each service and purely talking about the time from when I make the request to the service (eg gemini) to the first chunk that's received from it. While this stack works, it overall doesn't feel very responsive. I'm wondering if other people have come across the same thing and what they're using.
