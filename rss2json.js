The Ukrainian president, meanwhile, expressed hope that the URC would produce \u201cvery strong, concrete results\u201d.\n\nPoland, which is already the primary hub for transporting arms, aid and people in and out of Ukraine, has long sought to position itself as a key partner in Ukraine\u2019s post-war reconstruction.\n\nIn 2022,\u00a0[more than 400 Polish companies signed up](\u00a0to a government-backed programme to take part in rebuilding efforts, particularly in sectors such as construction, transport, energy and IT.\n\nA 2022\u00a0[report\u00a0]( Pekao, a Polish bank, estimated that Ukraine\u2019s postwar recovery could bring Poland\u2019s economy 190 billion zloty (then \u20ac38.9 billion) over time, linked to reconstruction work and Ukraine\u2019s integration with the European Union.\n\nSpeaking today, Tusk said that the countries at the conference would also discuss \u201cfurther deliveries of arms and aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia\u201d as well as expanding energy cooperation.\n\n\u201cThis is another good example of how aid can also be a good economic venture for both sides,\u201d said the Polish prime minister. \u201cUkraine today needs more energy and Poland is becoming, or has become, a key partner in terms of gas supplies and supplementing your electricity deficits.\u201d\n\nHis comments came days after Poland\u2019s gas exports reached a\u00a0[new record daily high]( with the majority accounted for by growing deliveries to Ukraine via a\u00a0[recently expanded cross-border connection](\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot to be done here, and I declare my full commitment to this, especially since we are talking about a situation in which we not only help each other, but also earn good money,\u201d Tusk added. Zelensky echoed his remarks, saying that this is an area \u201cthat can strengthen both our countries\u201d.\n\nThe two leaders also signed a letter of intent on cooperation in the joint production of ammunition and military equipment, as well as the development of defence technologies.\n\nTusk said negotiations on the issue had been underway for months and had focused on making \u201cthe idea of joint production of weapons and ammunition in plants in both Poland and Ukraine a reality, finding financing, and removing barriers that prevented or hindered the exchange of technology\u201d.\n\nThe Polish prime minister also said that they would work on ensuring that money from the\u00a0[European Union\u2019s SAFE programme](\u00a0\u2013 which provides \u20ac150 billion of loans to support defence spending, including to help Ukraine \u2013 \u201ccan be used as effectively as possible for joint security\u201d.\n\nZelensky likewise expressed hope that plans for joint production of weapons, especially drones, under the SAFE programme, will materialise.\n\nLast September, shortly after multiple Russian drones\u00a0[violated Polish airspace]( Poland and Ukraine\u00a0[signed an agreement](\u00a0to set up a joint working group to share experience and expertise in drone warfare.\n\nSpeaking today, Tusk also referred to peace negotiations underway this week in Abu Dhabi between Ukrainian, American and Russian delegations, saying that Poland \u201cwill certainly not accept any solution that would be contrary to Ukraine\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nZelensky, meanwhile, thanked Poland and its people for their support since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, including most recently the\u00a0[transfer of hundreds of power generators](\u00a0and heaters to help Ukraine cope with Russian attacks on energy infrastructure during freezing winter temperatures.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/05/tusk-and-zelensky-meet-in-kyiv-for-talks-on-poland-hosting-ukraine-recovery-conference/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What are the prospects for Poland\u2019s far-right politician Grzegorz Braun?", "summary": "**By Aleks Szczerbiak**\n\nA far-right politician\u2019s unexpectedly strong presidential bid has upended Poland\u2019s right-wing landscape, transforming him from a political eccentric into a disruptive force that the mainstream can no longer ignore.\n\nHis surge exposes deep fractures on the Polish right and raises the question of whether his radical \u201canti\u2011system\u201d appeal marks a temporary protest spike or more lasting realignment.\n\n# Presidential election wild card\n\nOne of the big political surprises in Poland last year was the rise of far-right politician Grzegorz Braun and his nationalist-monarchist Confederation of the Polish Crown (KPP).\n\nPreviously a filmmaker and long known for his eccentric manner as a political provocateur, Braun was one of the best-known and widely recognised leaders of the radical-right Confederation (Konfederacja) alliance, which united free-marketeers, nationalists and monarchists under one banner.\n\nLast January, after Confederation endorsed S\u0142awomir Mentzen as its official candidate in the May-June 2025 presidential election (who finished a strong third with 14.8% of the first-round votes), Braun announced his own rival bid, leading to his expulsion from the broader alliance. However, Braun significantly exceeded pre-election forecasts, securing\u00a0[fourth place with 6.3%](\n\nThis result paved the way for Braun to establish himself as a significant political actor, and since then his party\u2019s\u00a0[popularity has surged](\n\nNotably, he has picked up not just ex-Confederation voters but also disillusioned supporters of the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS), Poland\u2019s ruling party between 2015 and 2023 and currently the main opposition grouping.\n\nAccording to the\u00a0*Politico Europe*\u00a0aggregator of Polish opinion polls, Braun\u2019s party is currently averaging around 9% (firmly above the 5% parliamentary representation threshold).\n\n# A \u201cpurer\u201d conservative-nationalist voice\n\nThrough its attachment to traditionalist Catholicism and moral-cultural values and support for a monarchy as the ideal system of government, Braun\u2019s party appeals to staunchly socially conservative voters, although it also includes many individuals whose views are at odds with Christianity or contradict mainstream church teaching.\n\nHowever, its broader appeal is rooted in a combination of far-right, anti-establishment talking points that attract a number of particular constituencies, each of which has a specific issue that they are strongly engaged with.\n\nAbove all, Braun\u2018s movement claims to be the only \u201ctrue\u201d, credible and authentic anti-establishment choice and offers a \u201cpurer\u201d version of conservative-nationalism to those disillusioned Polish voters who feel that other right-wing parties have compromised too much with the status quo.\n\nNot only does Braun argue that the original Confederation is now too mainstream, many commentators say he is also increasingly picking up ex-PiS voters who feel that the former ruling party has not atoned sufficiently for its perceived strategic and moral errors during its period of office.\n\nThese were felt to include surrendering too much power to the EU, turning into a \u201cnew elite\u201d that abandoned its original anti-system roots, and being too pro-Ukrainian.\n\n# Opposing foreign influences\n\nIndeed,\u00a0 Braun attracts those voters who oppose Russia\u2019s isolation and do not see Moscow as a security threat. For sure, such narratives are almost invisible in Polish public discourse, and openly Russophile Poles probably account for less than 10% of the electorate.\n\nHowever, broader anti-Ukrainian sentiment has increased in recent months and many more Poles are worried about their country being dragged into the armed conflict. Braun appeals to these voters by opposing both military aid to Ukraine and the so-called \u201cUkrainisation\u201d of Poland.\n\nIndeed, arguably it is the Ukraine issue that has played a particularly important role in generating support for Braun. His party performs disproportionately well in the southeastern regions of Poland close to the border, where memories of\u00a0[wartime atrocities by Ukrainian nationalists](\u00a0are much fresher in historical memory.\n\nMany of the PiS switchers to Braun\u2019s party are likely to have been motivated by a feeling that the former ruling party did not advance Polish interests sufficiently in its relations with Ukraine.\n\nBraun also draws upon anti-Jewish discourses, criticising the so-called \u201cJudaisation\u201d of Polish politics and even\u00a0[claiming](\u00a0that the current gas chambers at the Auschwitz German-Nazi death camp are fake.\n\nThis obviously puts him on a collision course with any US administration, but his anti-Jewish rhetoric is often linked with pledges to downgrade transatlantic cooperation as part of a broader package of cleansing Poland of alleged foreign influences.\n\nIndeed, concerns about defending Polish national sovereignty are at the heart of Braun\u2019s programme, including a call for Poland to withdraw immediately from the EU, so-called \u201cPolexit\u201d.\n\n# A highly effective political performer\n\nTogether with his radical rhetoric, among Braun\u2019s trademarks are his provocative and highly visible performative protests and \u201coutrage stunts\u201d designed to generate media traction, which his supporters view as uncompromising acts of defiance and strength.\n\nThese include: burning and\u00a0[vandalising](\u00a0Ukrainian, EU and LGBT symbols and flags;\u00a0[attacking a gynaecologist](\u00a0who performed late-term abortions; disturbing a minute\u2019s silence for Holocaust victims in the European Parliament; and\u00a0[using a fire extinguisher to disrupt](\u00a0a Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony in the Polish parliament.\n\nThe Hanukkah incident, which gained him international notoriety, formed the basis of Braun\u2019s presidential campaign symbol and rallying slogan for his so-called \u201cbroad fire-extinguisher front\u201d (*szeroki front ga\u015bnicowy*) resistance movement.\n\nIn essence, the key to Braun\u2019s success is his ability to tap into, harness and amplify a deep vein of voter discontent and position himself as a radical, uncompromising \u201canti-system\u201d voice; the political vehicle for those Poles who believe traditional societal norms and social relations are in crisis.\n\nIn any political bidding war, he pushes the rhetorical boundaries and does not impose any limits upon himself, speaking openly about subjects that the mainstream parties and media avoid.\n\nMoreover, despite his controversial views, Braun is well spoken and presents himself as a calm, articulate and highly effective media performer and debater, with a demeanour and speaking style that some voters find more authentic than mainstream politicians.\n\n# A headache for the Polish right\n\nThe surge in support for Braun\u2019s party has fragmented \u2013 and exacerbated ideological and personal conflicts within \u2013 the right-wing camp. In addition to deep bitterness between Braun and the original Confederation, this includes fundamental disagreements in areas such as national security and transatlantic relations, which significantly complicate efforts to build a unified right-wing front ahead of the next parliamentary election, scheduled for autumn 2027.\n\nThe problem is that, even though the Polish right currently enjoys a numerical overall majority in the polls, electoral simulations indicate that Braun\u2019s party has become an indispensable component of any future right-wing governing coalition.\n\nHowever, a coalition of necessity with Braun would be a minefield because his radical rhetoric and actions mean that any hint of a formal alliance will be leveraged by the current liberal-centrist and left-wing governing parties to discredit the entire right-wing camp as unfit for office.\n\nA possible link-up with Braun\u2019s party could also emerge before the election around the question of whether to form a united right-wing slate to challenge the ruling coalition in the Senate, Poland\u2019s less powerful second chamber, which is elected by the first-past-the-post system that favours large, unified electoral blocs.\n\n# Too extreme even for most conservative Poles?\n\nDespite the momentum that Braun\u2019s party has developed during the last few months, it still faces significant hurdles.\n\nAlthough held together at its core by a strong anti-establishment and \u201canti-system\u201d radicalism and rejection of the existing political order, the grouping is ideologically diverse, attracting a wide range of fringe radicals with very different motivations. This lack of coherent programmatic foundations poses a significant risk to the party\u2019s long-term stability.\n\nIndeed, some commentators argue that, notwithstanding his apparently uncompromising and intransigent approach, Braun\u2019s vision of politics is essentially as a theatrical performance with little real-world impact beyond drawing attention to himself.\n\nMoreover, some right-wing critics say that, by rejecting mainstream norms,\u00a0 Braun\u2019s stunts and shock tactics actually overshadow and discredit more reasoned conservative arguments on issues such as the overcentralisation of power by EU institutions.\n\nThe grouping\u2019s appeal is also limited by the fact that, beyond Braun himself, it lacks well-known leaders, while some of those who are associated with the party have\u00a0[chequered pasts](\u00a0and are easy to discredit.\n\nWhile\u00a0 Braun\u2019s radical rhetoric and actions have not prevented his growth in support up until now, he appeals to a very specific, radicalised \u201canti-system\u201d voter demographic. This could comprise as much as 15% of the electorate, but it is difficult to see his support base expanding much beyond that.\n\nHis toxic reputation, idiosyncrasy and ideological rigidity, together with a harsh and unadulterated political message, probably make Braun unpalatable for the majority of even more conservative Poles.\n\nMoreover, his party\u2019s economic programme \u2013 which combines support for national economic sovereignty and protectionism with deregulation, abolishing income tax and opposition to large fiscal transfers \u2013 presents a significant ideological barrier to winning over a broader swathe of PiS voters.\n\nHowever disillusioned and frustrated the latter may be, it is questionable how many of them will be prepared to support a grouping that departs so radically from the state-interventionist and welfare-oriented model that PiS has championed and which originally attracted many of its voters to the party.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that, although moderately successful political formations have been built on the strength of a credible presidential election performance, the next scheduled parliamentary poll is not until autumn 2027.\n\nHowever adept a performer Braun may be, it will be very difficult for him to keep up this level of interest for that length of time in such a fast-moving, social media-driven political age. Moreover, arguably Braun\u2019s party\u2019s poll ratings, and even his earlier presidential election result, may simply be a \u201csafe\u201d expression of mid-term voter frustration and not translate into support at the ballot box when the composition of the next government is at stake.\n\n# Shifting the \u201cOverton window\u201d?\n\nOn the other hand, given that Braun\u2019s party is a controversial, radical insurgent grouping aimed explicitly at \u201canti-system\u201d and anti-establishment voters, it may be that it has a \u201chidden\u201d electorate that avoids declaring its voting intentions, and polling is actually underestimating its true level of support. Moreover, Braun has been able to bypass the traditional media successfully by utilising new social media platforms.\n\nAt the same time, attempts by his political opponents to use legal channels against him \u2013 such as criminal prosecutions arising from his various stunts, and attempting to censor or even ban his party \u2013 could backfire, simply galvanising and boosting Braun\u2019s support by allowing him to frame these actions as the establishment persecuting an unpalatable truth-teller.\n\nGiven the importance of the Ukraine issue in fuelling support for Braun\u2019s party, a key question is: how might an end to hostilities impact upon its continuing appeal?\n\nOn the one hand, concerns about Poland being drawn into the armed conflict would no longer be such a priority for voters. On the other hand, Braun could probably find a politically salient substitute; for example, questioning the continued presence in Poland of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians once the war was over.\n\nSome commentators argue that, regardless of whether his grouping establishes itself as a long-term fixture on the Polish political scene, Braun has already had an impact on the country\u2019s political discourse, shifting the so-called \u201cOverton window\u201d range of policies or issues that society finds acceptable for public discussion at a given time.\n\nIf Braun\u2019s support continues to grow, it could cause panic within the ranks of PiS and the original Confederation, forcing them to compete on both general radicalism and specifically anti-Ukrainian, anti-EU and anti-establishment discourses.\n\nOn the other hand, Confederation may actually benefit from its relative \u201cmainstreaming\u201d, while PiS is aware that, if the party tries too hard to emulate Braun\u2019s more radical policies or harsher rhetoric, it risks alienating the more moderate conservative-centrists that it needs to return to power.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/03/what-are-the-prospects-for-polands-far-right-politician-grzegorz-braun/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
