However, Poland has said that it still plans to challenge the deal in the EU\u2019s top court.\n\nThe Mercosur agreement has\u00a0[aroused particular concern over its possible impact on agriculture]( As today\u2019s vote was taking place in Brussels, Polish farmers gathered for their latest protest in Warsaw.\n\nApproval of the Mercosur deal required a so-called \u201cqualified majority\u201d of EU member states, rather than unanimity. Opponents of the deal had hoped that Italy would vote against it, helping create a blocking minority.\n\nBut, according to multiple news agencies, only Poland, France, Austria, Hungary and Ireland opposed the agreement. They together represent 29% of the EU\u2019s population, below the 35% threshold required to prevent a qualified majority.\n\nThe approval clears the way for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to travel to Paraguay to sign the agreement with Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The agreement eliminates tariffs on most trade between the two blocs.\n\nHowever, ahead of the vote, EU member states approved a safeguard clause aimed at protecting domestic producers from excessive agricultural imports. The mechanism will be triggered if prices of sensitive products such as beef, poultry or dairy fall by 5%, a stricter threshold than the previously proposed 8%.\n\nPoland\u2019s government has consistently opposed the Mercosur deal and, after today\u2019s vote, deputy prime minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz announced that his country would challenge the agreement at the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nPoland \u201cwill continue to fight for equal standards for European farmers\u201d, declared Kosiniak-Kamysz. Agricultural producers have argued that the Mercosur deal would result in imports of cheap South American food produced to lower standards, harming European agriculture and consumers.\n\nToday\u2019s vote came as farmers gathered in Warsaw for their latest protest against the agreement. Thousands joined a march through the capital towards the prime minister\u2019s office, carrying banners\u00a0reading \u201cStop EU-Mercosur\u201d, \u201cStop chemicals from Mercosur\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t kill Polish agriculture\u201d.\n\nWhile many farmers travelled to Warsaw by tractor, the municipal authorities barred the vehicles from entering the city centre, meaning hundeds of them were left on the outskirts, reported agricultural news service TopAgrar. Farmers also protested in France, Belgium, Spain and Greece on Thursday.\n\nAhead of the protest, farmers\u2019 representatives met with opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki at the presidential palace.\n\n\u201cPresident Karol Nawrocki assured his full support for Polish farmers and agriculture,\u201d said presidential spokesman Rafa\u0142 Le\u015bkiewicz, quoted by the Interia news website. \u201cHe clearly stated that he does not agree to the harmful agreement with Mercosur countries.\u201d\n\nAgriculture minister Stefan Krajewski also said that he was ready to meet the protesters and reiterated that \u201cthe government supports the farmers demonstrating in Warsaw on Friday and opposes the Mercosur agreement\u201d, reported online news service Onet.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/09/poland-fails-in-bid-block-eus-mercosor-trade-deal-as-farmers-protest-in-warsaw/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rachel Reeves faces tax rise dilemma over immigration forecast", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/rachel-reeves-raise-tax-rise-6w2xvts92", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Men used to go to war but now ?", "summary": "But now we all gain a subconscious and don\u2019t want to die for old politicians who have a big self ego.
