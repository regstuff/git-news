The most recent signal was the US decision to revoke the Chabahar Port sanctions waiver that India had. This hurts India directly because Chabahar was a big part of our North-South Transport Corridor plan connecting us to Russia. Now that plan looks shaky, while the US is pushing its own IMEC corridor with Europe and the Middle East.\n\nEven though India isn\u2019t the main target, our interests are caught in the crossfire. By tightening pressure on Iran, Washington is not just hurting Tehran\u2019s economy but also indirectly slowing down India\u2019s projects with Iran. At the same time, there are signs that the US wants to re-establish a stronger presence in Afghanistan, maybe even at Bagram Air Base. That could only happen with some level of cooperation from Pakistan. The recent warming of US-Pakistan relations, plus defense agreements involving Saudi Arabia, fit into this picture.\n\nIf that happens, Afghanistan could be used as a launchpad for operations against Iran. Israel also benefits from this pressure because they\u2019ve always pushed for regime change in Tehran. I can\u2019t help but think the US and Israel want to weaken or even completely wipe out Iran\u2019s power structure.\n\nAt the same time, Russia and China are unlikely to stay silent. Both countries have strong ties with Iran, and they see Tehran as a counterbalance to US influence in the region. If Iran is attacked directly, they might step in with military or economic support. Even limited backing like weapons, intelligence, or financial aid could quickly turn a regional conflict into something much larger and harder to control.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m reading too much into the pace of these developments, but the way events are moving makes me think we\u2019re heading toward a major confrontation. If this turns into open conflict, it could easily spiral into something like World War 3.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is the US-Israel push really about wiping Iran out, or is it more about building leverage and reshaping the region\u2019s economic routes?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1nkhz2s/do_you_think_the_us_and_israel_are_building_up/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Early humans may have walked from Turkey to mainland Europe, research suggests", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-09-early-humans-turkey-mainland-europe.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Who want gemini pro + veo3 &amp; 2TB storage at 90% discount for 1year. ?", "summary": "Who want to know???ping me", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nkfung/who_want_gemini_pro_veo3_2tb_storage_at_90/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "People living with Parkinson's disease have said their local table tennis club has \"transformed\" their lives by improving their health and giving them confidence.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yk76j5j0wo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "This is how a Viking's hair and beard may have looked", "summary": "Excerpt:\n\nThe carved man has a middle parting and wavy hair.\n\nThe back of the head is cropped short, with a small curl is visible above the ear.\n\nThe Viking sports a strong moustache and prominent sideburns.\n\nThe most remarkable feature, however, is the man's long, pointed, and braided beard.\n\n\"This is as close as we get to a portrait of a Viking,\" says Peter Pentz.", "link": "https://www.sciencenorway.no/archaeology-culture-the-viking-age/this-is-how-a-vikings-hair-and-beard-may-have-looked/2552179", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Teen who pushed her brother in wheelchair at every high school cross country meet starts new chapter", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/teen-who-pushed-her-brother-in-wheelchair-high-school-cross-country-meet-starts-new-chapter/89-4373433e-6710-4f84-95bf-a3d3e065f938", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A wildfire destroyed most of her art \u2014 but at 85 she\u2019s painting like never before", "summary": "This article made me smile.
