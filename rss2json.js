Even when both parties are African and the entire transaction happens in Africa. Why? Colonial legacy plus the perception that English law is sophisticated and their courts are fast.\n\nThe result according to the study is African countries are essentially exporting legal work to London. Their own court systems never develop the case law and experience to handle complex commercial matters. African lawyers lose work. And the enforcement costs (London solicitor rates up to 1000 pounds per hour, flights, visas) often exceed the contract value for African parties.\n\nWe are doing the exact same thing but worse because we actually have the capacity to fix it and we are not. While courts in India have ruled that if both parties are based in India, disputes cannot be outsourced to a foreign country, our system is slow, and people prefer arbitation and for them they go outside  India which is permitted. \n\nSingapore has positioned itself as the arbitration capital of Asia, SIAC (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) handles massive Indian disputes. Their 2022 annual report shows India was the TOP foreign user of SIAC and we are literally their biggest customer. London Court of International Arbitration? Indian parties are consistently in their top 5 users by nationality. Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC), again exploding growth in Indian cases.\n\nA complex international arbitration can easily cost 5 to 10 crore rupees. Sometimes much more. Every single rupee of that goes to Singapore lawyers, London barristers, Dubai arbitrators, foreign expert witnesses, international law firms, zero rupees stay in India. But it gets worse, like the African study documents, when you choose Singapore or English law, you are importing their entire legal framework. Their public policy rules, their insolvency laws, their regulatory approach. Indian companies are unknowingly subjecting themselves to foreign legal systems they do not fully understand.\n\nThe African paper argues it is partly colonial mentality but mostly rational economic choice. African courts are slow and sometimes unpredictable. So businesses pay premium prices for foreign forums. \n\nOur average case takes what, 15 years? Our commercial courts are improving but massive backlog remains. Our judges are overworked, vacancies are not filled on time. So Indian businesses, especially those doing international deals, rationally choose Singapore arbitration or London courts. We are paying other countries to do what we should be doing ourselves.\n\nThis is not just about money, it is about legal sovereignty and soft power. When Indian companies settle their disputes under Singapore or English law, those legal systems accumulate experience, precedents and expertise in Indian commercial practices. They become more sophisticated, their lawyers develop deep knowledge of Indian business culture, Indian regulatory environment, Indian market dynamics.\n\nMeanwhile our own legal system is starved of this experience, our courts never see these complex cases and our lawyers never develop that expertise, as a result we remain dependent.\n\nThe African study makes this point explicitly. It is a form of continued legal colonization. The colonizer no longer needs to rule you politically. They just need you to voluntarily bring all your important legal disputes to their courts.\n\nSingapore is not our former colonizer but they are absolutely eating our lunch in legal services. And we are serving it to them on a platter. Legal UK published a report in 2021 estimating English law contributes over 25 billion pounds annually to UK economy and a significant chunk of that is from foreign parties (like us) using English law and courts.\n\nSingapore Law Ministry reported legal services sector generated 1.6 billion SGD in 2021. Their explicit strategy is to be the dispute resolution hub for Asia. Meaning they want our disputes,  and Dubai is actively building the same model for Middle East and South Asia.\n\nThe paper's recommendation for Africa was to stop treating foreign forum clauses as sacred. Develop local legal capacity, adapt foreign legal concepts to local needs rather than wholesale adoption and uild confidence in domestic legal institutions.\n\nFor India this means:\n\nActually fix our court backlogs, just showing digitized boards of pending case, won't work. Singapore cases resolve in 12 to 18 months, ours take 15 years and that is the ball game.\n\nAggressively promote Indian arbitration institutions like Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration but also make them actually good, not just marketing. Train our judges in complex commercial law, hire more judges. \n\nDevelop Indian commercial law that is sophisticated and predictable, publish judgments faster. Stop being apologetic about using Indian law and Indian forums, Singapore did not become arbitration hub by being humble, they marketed aggressively and delivered quality.\n\nProfessor Iheme argues in his paper that Anglophone African countries need to step out from the shadow of English law and develop their own legal systems suited to their needs. Not abandon English legal concepts entirely but adapt them and stop the reflexive deference. His methodology is explicitly \"Afrocentric\" meaning he centers African interests and experiences rather than accepting English law as the gold standard.\n\nWe need the same energy using an India centric approach to commercial law and dispute resolution. Not copying Singapore or London but building something suited to Indian commercial reality that also meets international standards.\n\nOtherwise we will still be in this same position in 2050, waiting 15 years for our courts while paying billions to Singapore and London to resolve our disputes faster. The African study is a mirror and we need to look at it honestly.\n\nFull citation for anyone interested: Iheme, Williams C. \"The Overdependence of African Courts and Businesses on English Law and Forum: The Negative Repercussions on the Development of African Legal and Economic Systems\" Pravni Zapisi Vol. 15 No. 1 (2024) pp. 151-190  \n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1on54tk/while_our_courts_take_15_years_per_case_uk/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "As world rises up for Gaza, Sudanese in Israel say larger catastrophe [in Sudan] being ignored", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-world-rises-up-for-gaza-sudanese-in-israel-say-larger-catastrophe-being-ignored/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Virtualord 0.3.0 - TBS game with TD and RPG elements and isometric graphics", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/vivaladav/virtualord", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New national law in South Korea will turn large parking lots into solar power farms", "summary": "", "link": "https://electrek.co/2025/11/02/new-national-law-will-turn-large-parking-lots-into-solar-power-farms/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "fine-tuning-llms-with-nvidia-dgx-spark-and-unsloth", "summary": "Hi team,\n\nI follow this tuto [ but when I execute the code there is the following error:\n\n    NotImplementedError: Unsloth currently only works on NVIDIA GPUs and Intel GPUs.NotImplementedError: Unsloth currently only works on NVIDIA GPUs and Intel GPUs.\n\nAs you can see.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny idea?\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarc", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1oncad6/finetuningllmswithnvidiadgxsparkandunsloth/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Outspoken Mexican Mayor Who Declared War on Cartels Is Killed", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/world/americas/manzo-mayor-mexico-killed.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is there any plan to support qwen3vl for video RL processing?", "summary": "I modified your visual GRPO code to support video tasks, but it's always out of memory.

This is not a Western world phenomenon. This is a GLOBAL phenomenon. China, Mexico, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey, Vietnam, Argentina, Iran, Thailand, Indonesia, The Philippines, Colombia, Malaysia, etc...are all at or bellow population replacement. The only places that are still having high birthrates are sub-Saharan Africa and parts of central Asia.\n\nThere is no universally accepted consensus as to what is causing this, as this is happening in rich and poor countries alike. It is happening in countries with massive social-welfare safety nets and subsidies and in countries with none of those. It is happening in secular countries and in highly religious countries alike. It is happening in countries with harsh working conditions and in countries that provide generous vacations and strict laws against overtime work.\n\nIncome inequality does not seem like a good explanation either. Brazil ranks #178 on the equality index, Chile ranks at #174. They both have the same fertility rate as Switzerland and Australia, which rank at #22 and #23 respectively on the income equality scale. Also, Jamaica, Thailand, Mauritius, and the United Arab Emirates have lower fertility rates than Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands or Canada.\n\nDoes not seem to be a cost of living issue either, as e[ven families making north of $700K/year are having fewer children.](\n\nThe only common pattern seems to be urbanization. Scandinavian countries, countries like Singapore, Japan and South Korea have invested massive amounts of money trying to revert birthrates declines with not much to show for it. Singapore for example virtually guarantees affordable housing for all of its citizens, plus free schooling, affordable medical care, etc... and still has one of the lowest birthrates in the planet. No country has yet figured out how to reverse the trend, but many are trying.\n\nThis is not an issue with capitalism either. Non-market economies like Cuba and North Korea are facing the same crisis.\n\n[Cuba to Women: Please Have More Babies](\n\n[Video Shows Kim Jong Un Crying Over North Korea's Lack of Babies](\n\nAlso, the issue here is no wanting more people on Earth to sustain \"infinite growth\". It is not that we need to be 10 billion, 20 billion people in order to prosper. We don't. Maybe we would be fine if we reverted back to say...3 billion people globally. The problem we are facing is the pace of the decline. When birthrates fall off a cliff, as we are seeing now, you end up with a massively large old population that needs to be supported by an ever declining young population. We don't know how to run a society with more retirees than working people, or with more sickly people than healthy ones.

He has been charged with various crimes, including inciting hatred, making criminal threats, and using symbols that express support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nEarly on Monday, police in the city of Gdynia announced that they had on Friday evening detained a 44-year-old man suspected of committing crimes relating to \u201cposting online materials containing threats, inciting hatred, promoting violence, and disclosing personal information\u201d.\n\nDuring the stop, which took place in the man\u2019s car, it was also discovered that he was driving under the influence of drugs, with a blood test showing the presence of \u201cseveral psychoactive substances\u201d.\n\nVarious media outlets have named him as Piotr N., with his surname hidden under Polish privacy law. He published online under the nickname \u201cNazar\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe suspect has been charged with six offences, including\u00a0disseminating content on social media inciting hatred based on nationality and religion, promoting symbols of support for Russian aggression against Ukraine, making criminal threats, and violating the data protection rules.\n\nIn 2022, Poland\u2019s parliament\u00a0[almost unanimously approved](\u00a0a law making the display of symbols supporting Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine illegal,\u00a0[punishable by up to two years in prison]( Inciting national, religious, racial or ethnic hatred has long been a crime, carrying a prison sentence of up to three years.\n\nVarious Polish media outlets report that the charge of criminal threats relates to online material in which Piotr N. displays a bladed weapon. He may additionally be charged with driving under the influence of drugs once an expert report on his blood test results is completed.\n\nThe police have also filed a motion, supported by prosecutors, to place Piotr N. in pretrial detention. A court is due to hold a hearing on that today.\n\n\n\nUnder the name Nazar, Piotr N. runs a TikTok channel on which he regularly posts anti-Ukrainian and anti-Israeli material. He also makes clear his support for radical-right leader\u00a0[Grzegorz Braun]( who\u00a0[finished fourth](\u00a0in this year\u2019s presidential elections.\n\nProsecutors are also\u00a0[seeking to charge Braun for various alleged crimes](\u00a0relating to his\u00a0[anti-Ukrainian](\u00a0[anti-Jewish](\u00a0and\u00a0[anti-LGBT](\u00a0rhetoric and actions during the election campaign. But first they need the European Parliament, where he is an MEP, to strip his legal immunity.\n\nLocal media outlet [Trojmiasto.pl]( reports that, in recent months, Piotr N. has been regularly tearing down Ukrainian flags in the Tricity area on Poland\u2019s northern Baltic coast, which Gdynia is part of. Braun is also facing potential charges for ripping down a Ukrainian flag.\n\nThe\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0daily adds that Piotr N. also attacked a Ukrainian restaurant and kicked a woman for displaying a Ukrainian flag. His TikTok videos also show him putting up stickers of an Israeli flag with the words (in English) \u201cWipe shoes here\u201d written on it.\n\n\n\nIn June this year, Piotr N. was also arrested in the city of Krak\u00f3w in southern Poland after tearing down Ukrainian flags, including from the historic S\u0142owacki Theatre. He was charged with damaging a historic building and threatening the director of the theatre, reported\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*.\n\nThe following month, he was also charged with nine other alleged crimes committed in the Tricity area, including threats and incitement to hatred, again in relation to Ukrainian flags being displayed in the area. In one case, he used pepper spray against another person while trying to access a private building.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many public and private buildings in Poland have displayed Ukrainian flags as a sign of support and solidarity. Poland also welcomed millions of Ukrainian immigrants and has provided extensive military, financial and diplomatic support to Kyiv.\n\nHowever, this year has seen growing criticism of Ukrainians and Ukraine in Poland, stirred up in particular by Braun and the\u00a0[far-right Confederation](\u00a0(Konfederacja) party that he was one of the leaders of until being expelled in January due to announcing an unsanctioned run for the presidency.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/03/anti-ukrainian-activist-charged-in-poland-for-inciting-hatred-and-pro-russian-symbols/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
