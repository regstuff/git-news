This is an emerging field, and I believe this subreddit can provide valuable insights from those who have experience fine-tuning and optimizing models.\n\nI have several questions and would appreciate any guidance:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Feasibility of 7B for Financial Expertise** \u2013 Given my hardware constraints, I\u2019m considering leveraging **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and fine-tuning** to enhance DeepSeek R1 (7B). Do you think this approach is viable for creating an efficient financial expert bot, or would I inevitably need a larger model with more training data to achieve good performance?\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **GPU Rental Services for Training** \u2013 Has anyone used **cloud GPU services** (Lambda Labs, RunPod, [Vast.ai]( etc.) for fine-tuning? If so, what was your experience? Any recommendations in terms of cost-effectiveness and reliability?\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Fine-Tuning &amp; RAG Best Practices** \u2013 From my research, **dataset quality** is one of the most critical factors in fine-tuning. Any suggestions on methodologies or tools to ensure high-quality datasets? Are there any pitfalls or best practices you\u2019ve learned from experience?\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Challenges &amp; Lessons Learned** \u2013 This field is vast, with multiple factors affecting the **final model's quality**, such as **quantization, dataset selection, and optimization techniques**. This thread also serves as an opportunity to hear from those who have fine-tuned LLMs for **other use cases**, even if not in finance. What were your biggest challenges? What would you do differently in hindsight?\n\nI\u2019m eager to learn from those who have gone through similar journeys and to discuss what to expect along the way.
