I hope some of you find this useful Feedback is always welcome", "link": "https://youtu.be/Lt7KrFMcCis", "author": "None"}, {"title": "1000 year old Roman bridge gets destroyed by flash flood in Talavera de la Reina, Spain", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/rwgei8f7imqe1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bootstrap 5 Prjects", "summary": "Bootstrap serves as a favorite tool that allows developers to generate websites efficiently.

My dataset follows the Alpaca structure (input, prompt, output).\n\nNow, I want to fine-tune Mistral Small 3.1, which should work fine on my 3090 24GB.\n\nOn this page:\n\n\nthey say it has been tested with the Alpaca dataset and recommend using this Colab notebook:\n\n\nHowever, this notebook uses a different dataset and a very different prompt template.\n\nHas anyone fine-tuned Mistral Small 3.1 yet? What kind of prompt template does it expect when using the Alpaca dataset?\n\nMany thanks,\nP\n\n@Unsloth team: You are amazing and have changed the way I work forever!\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1ji4ctn/finetune_mistral_small_31/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Seeking Advice on Building a Professional Vocabulary List to Evaluate Article Professionalism", "summary": "I'm working on implementing a method to evaluate the professionalism of an online article. My current idea is to build a vocabulary of specialized terms covering categories such as computer science, biology, and law. Then, I plan to use an LLM to score these terms based on their importance and complexity. Finally, I will calculate the article's professionalism score based on the presence and scores of these specialized terms. (This is my current approach\u2014if you have a better idea, I'd love to hear it!)\n\nI want to construct a comprehensive vocabulary as much as possible. Right now, I'm filtering entity data from Wikidata to extract all conceptual and knowledge-based entities, which has taken quite some time. Next, I plan to mine more specialized terms from the ArXiv dataset.\n\nI\u2019d like to ask for your advice on the following:\n\n1. Do you know of any comprehensive, ready-to-use databases of specialized terminology?\n2. Are there better approaches or tools that could help me build this vocabulary more effectively?\n\nThanks for your help!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jiholz/seeking_advice_on_building_a_professional/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada election live: Canadian PM Mark Carney calls 28 April election", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cwyd2x7xxwet", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
