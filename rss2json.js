I wanted to start exploring British Archaeology as I'm considering doing an advanced degree there in the next few years. I'm only a few dozen pages in, but I find it to be more of a pop science style book than a truly academic read. The style seems to be pretty easy to read and comprehend, and it seems to jump from topic to topic fairly quickly. It seems to lack a lot of in depth analysis especially early in the book.\n\nIs this a good book to start with when learning about British Archaeology? Is this simply an overview of a very dense subject that will introduce me to common topics in British Archaeology? Again, it feels like  an easy read, and I just want to confirm that this is worth my time as it is a fairly large text.
