Almost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland today.\n\n\u201cAfter almost four years, the situation is more stable,\u201d said government spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka at a press conference on Tuesday, announcing the plans. \u201cWe are no longer dealing with such a large, simultaneous wave of refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost \\[Ukrainian refugees\\] residing in Poland are working; their children are attending school,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we can now phase out these extraordinary measures and move from temporary solutions to systemic ones.\u201d\n\nIn March 2022, Poland put in place special measures to support Ukrainian refugees, who were at the time entering Poland in huge numbers. Since then, the legislation has been repeatedly extended.\n\nHowever, last year it was the subject of a political dispute between the government and newly elected President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nIn August, Nawrocki\u00a0[vetoed a government bill](\u00a0extending support on existing terms, arguing that it unjustly \u201cprivileged\u201d Ukrainians over other groups. In the end, he and the government\u00a0[reached a compromise](\u00a0that extended support until March 2026 but made access to certain benefits contingent upon employment.\n\nThe president also made clear that it was the last time he would approve an extension of special support for Ukrainians. \u201cWe need to switch to normal conditions, i.e. treating Ukrainian citizens in Poland in the same way as all other foreigners,\u201d said his chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki.\n\nThe new measures, which were agreed by the government on Tuesday but must still be approved by parliament and the president, would go into force in March 2026. They would end some forms of special support for Ukrainians immediately, while phasing out others by March 2027.\n\nInstead, the legislation would introduce \u201ca single, coherent support system for all foreigners covered by temporary protection in the EU, regardless of citizenship\u2026includ\\[ing\\] equal access to benefits, the labour market and healthcare\u201d,\u00a0[says](\u00a0Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s office.\n\nOne element of the bill would see \u201ca gradual transition of healthcare to principles similar to those applicable to Polish citizens (\\[through\\] contributions and insurance)\u201d,\u00a0[says](\u00a0the interior ministry.\n\nUkrainian refugees without healthcare insurance would be treated the same as uninsured Polish citizens. There would be exceptions for children, pregnant women, victims of violence, and wounded soldiers.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, special measures put in place to help Ukrainian children adapt to Polish schools \u2013 such as Polish language classes, preparatory courses and simplified rules for hiring intercultural assistants \u2013 will be removed at the end of the current academic year.\n\nMeanwhile, the provision of accommodation and food would be restricted to particularly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.\n\nThe current right of Ukrainians to establish a business under special rules \u2013 i.e. the same conditions applicable to Polish citizens \u2013 will also be terminated, notes the\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0daily.\n\nSome human rights groups have warned that the proposed new measures go too far, and could leave some vulnerable groups without protection and even at risk of homelessness.\n\nThe Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) argues that an element of the bill giving those wishing to obtain support a 14-day deadline to apply for a Polish identity number contravenes EU law. They also note that, for some Ukrainians, obtaining the necessary documentation may be hard due to the war in their homeland.\n\nThe office of Poland\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights has raised similar objections, reports\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lewiatan Confederation, a business lobby representing large employers,\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0the fact that the planned measures will limit the possibility of hiring Ukrainians under a simplified procedure.\n\nThey warn that this could \u201cparalyse the labour\u201d market, noting that Ukrainians constitute around 66% of the million or so foreign workers in Poland.\n\nLewiatan also criticised the fact that temporary protection would be removed from foreigners who leave Poland for more than 30 days, noting that the bill does not make any exception for employees posted abroad by Polish companies.\n\nThe bill could still be amended while it undergoes work in parliament, where the government has a majority. Once approved by parliament, Nawrocki would have the choice of signing it into law, vetoing it, or sending it to the constitutional court for review.\n\nWhile the initial mass arrival of Ukrainian refugees in Poland in 2022 prompted a mass outpouring of support from Poles, many of whom hosted refugees in their own homes, sentiment has recently been turning against them.\n\nA\u00a0[poll published this month](\u00a0by state research agency CBOS showed that the proportion of Poles opposed to accepting Ukrainian refugees has risen to 46%, the highest level ever recorded.\n\nIn September, a United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska found that 37% of Poles negatively view the presence of Ukrainians in Poland, up from 29.5% two years earlier.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/21/poland-plans-to-end-special-support-for-ukrainian-refugees/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Starmer pulls Chagos bill after backlash", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2026/01/23/starmer-pulls-chagos-deal-following-trump-backlash/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fighting Trump is a bad idea, Meloni privately told EU leaders", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/us-donald-trump-meloni-eu-leaders-fighting-bad-idea/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Zelensky criticises the EU\"s lack of \"political will\" in countering Putin", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.france24.com/en/zelensky-criticises-the-eu-s-lack-of-political-will-in-countering-putin", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Moscow Targeting Ukrainian Civilians to Break Kyiv - After months of a slogging advance against the Ukrainian army and the seizure of small villages in the east without significant territorial gains, Russia has expanded its drone and rocket attacks against major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv.", "summary": "", "link": "https://jamestown.org/moscow-targeting-ukrainian-civilians-to-break-kyiv/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian Court Demands $29 Million from Ukrainian Navy Officer for Sinking of Moskva Missile Cruiser - Militarnyi", "summary": "", "link": "https://militarnyi.com/en/news/russian-court-demands-29-million-from-ukrainian-navy-officer-for-sinking-of-moskva-missile-cruiser/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Sudan army chief gives soldiers seven days to crush rebellion", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0nn0dvg6jo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Africa Watch \u2013 Uganda mutes internet as International trade booms", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2026/01/africa-watch-uganda-mutes-internet-as-us-trade-booms/#gsc.tab=0", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UN rights body censures Iran's 'brutal repression' of protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-rights-body-holds-emergency-session-irans-protest-crackdown-2026-01-23/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
