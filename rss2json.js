We've been working hard this weekend to work on 1.58bit DeepSeek-R1 GGUFs! \ud83d\udc0b\n\nIt can now run in 1.58-bit, while being fully functional. We shrank the 671B parameter model from 720GB to just 131GB - a 80% size reduction.\n\nNaively quantizing all layers breaks the model entirely, causing endless loops &amp; gibberish outputs. Our dynamic quants solve this.\n\nThe 1.58-bit quant fits in 160GB VRAM (2x H100 80GB) for fast inference at ~140 tokens/sec.\n\nBy studying DeepSeek-R1\u2019s architecture, we selectively quantized certain layers to higher bits (like 4-bit), and leave most MoE layers to 1.5-bit.\n\nBenchmarks + Blog: \nDynamic GGUFs (131GB\u2013212GB) on Hugging Face: ", "link": "https://i.redd.it/4l4nopev8kfe1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China, India agree to strengthen strategic communication, enhance mutual political trust, resume direct flights: FM", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202501/1327661.shtml", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump &amp; Modi discuss PM's potential visit to US in February, purchase of American security equipment", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/diplomacy/trump-modi-discuss-pms-potential-visit-to-us-in-february-purchase-of-american-security-equipment/2466369/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Serbia's prime minister resigns and appeals for calm as anti-corruption protests grow", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/serbia-protests-vucevic-resigns-b71e3a0aacf5d0368b2bd1f4500170f5", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sri Lanka says talks on with Adani Group to lower wind power purchase cost - The Economic Times", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.economictimes.com/industry/renewables/sri-lanka-says-talks-on-with-adani-group-to-lower-wind-power-purchase-cost/articleshow/117623979.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Grad school advice", "summary": "First off, because I've read some of the other career advice posts on here: I will be graduating from undergrad with a double major in Anthropology and Geoscience and a double minor in Geology and Evolutionary Studies. I have completed a field school along with two seasons of excavation in Europe and 4 semesters of archaeological gcms analysis lab work. I am sure that archaeology is what I want to pursue even considering all of the potential cons. I am very interested in research, and hope to specialize in methods relating to climate and diet reconstruction in prehistoric sites. \n\nOn to my main issue: I was accepted to my dream program in the UK... Without any funding. Tuition is \u00a333000, and I already have some loan debt from undergrad. I was really hoping to get accepted to a program with some sort of funding. That being said, this program perfectly aligns with what I hope to research and there is no comparable program in my home country (US). That being said, the tuition plus living expenses will put me back several figures in debt. I've been weighing the pros and cons, and I'm just not sure what to do. I was wondering if anyone with professional experience has any advice on if the value of the degree outweighs the cost?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ibu51z/grad_school_advice/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New study finds that critical ocean current has not declined in the last 60 years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.whoi.edu/press-room/news-release/no-amoc-decline/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Abramovich dodged millions in tax with superyachts-for-hire scheme", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gprgyr707o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indiana bill to address backlog of untested rape kits receives unanimous support in committee", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/indiana/indiana-house-bill1413-backlog-untested-rape-kits-unanimous-support-in-committee/531-07a60ff2-a98f-4f66-b216-0afc37ce2ff9", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ICC prosecutor seeking arrest warrants for those accused of atrocities in Sudan's West Darfur region", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/icc-sudan-darfur-war-government-rsf-arrest-11f17e7d3bb3f2d48c4debb3ebb906a3", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to summarize multimodal content", "summary": "", "link": "/r/Rag/comments/1ibxknz/how_to_summarize_multimodal_content/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Horrocks engineering", "summary": "Anyone done any work with this company?

I can go to places like Anthrosource or Linkedin to look for jobs more local here and I've sent plenty of applications to any job I could just barely fit into. Haven't heard back from any of course.
