The goal is to collaboratively explore archaeology outreach through a shared storytelling experience, where participants create and interpret fictional material culture across a constructed landscape.\n\n**The Game:**  \nTCTC is a narrative-driven, worldbuilding RPG in which players develop the history of a civilization through the lens of its artifacts. These objects emerge, break, shift, and gain new meaning over time. The game reflects archaeological principles such as stratigraphy, palimpsest, intangible heritage, and object biography, while critically engaging with dominant narratives and the act of interpretation itself. It emphasizes a non-site-based understanding of archaeology, inviting players to focus on food, shelter, and landscape across time.\n\nGameplay centers dialogue between player and offers an accessible and reflective model of heritage engagement constructing a community\u2019s development based on evolving artifacts.\n\n**The Session:**\n\n* I will act as facilitator as we all play virtually. I am not an archeologist but I am in the sciences (ecologist / teacher).\n* We\u2019ll play a full session of the game (approx. 2-2.5 hours).\n* I\u2019ll ask questions throughout, drawing on your insights as we play.\n* The session will be recorded privately (audio and game notes only), strictly for reference.\n* I will use the transcript and outcomes to write an article highlighting key archaeological perspectives, the role of narrative in outreach, and how play can illustrate material and interpretive complexity. Additionally, just sharing the hopefully satisfying world we created as well. [Here is an example of my writing for reference](\n* The atmosphere will be relaxed and collaborative. Bringing your interests, expertise, and specific passions into the game is what will make it meaningful.\n\n**What I\u2019m Looking For:**\n\n* Practicing archaeologists or those of a similar field (any specialization welcome).\n* Willingness to reflect on material culture, community, and the values of archaeological outreach as we play. It will be a fictional setting but one where I would love to incorporate aspects of the real world in an appropriate way.\n* Availability for a late afternoon or evening session (EST, flexible).\n\nThis is an opportunity to engage in creative outreach and contribute to a piece that centers archaeologists' voices and interpretations. The resulting article will not use identifying quotes or drawings without consent, and your contributions will be treated with full professional respect. Prior to publishing the article I would share the draft to make sure everything is accurate to the field. While I am the creator of this game, the intent is not for promotion but to utilize a tool I made for something real and interesting. I am not offering any income for this, and I myself am not being paid, but I just want to try this experiment since, frankly, I just think it would be pretty cool.\n\nTo express interest or ask questions, please DM or comment below. If you are interested but unsure, I am also happy to send along a free copy of the game to provide further clarity.\n\nThanks,  \nKai Medina\n\n(Click the image bellow for full resolution)\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1m79qxk/seeking_archaeologists_for_a_creative_tabletop/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "raccoon", "summary": "This is a cool C++ library to interact with image files, you can add shapes, effects and change color.
