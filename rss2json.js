Organised by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a powerful sect in the Philippines, the three-day rally has shut down schools, roads and offices. Many of those protesting have camped out all night on the park\u2019s lawns, sleeping in tents or beneath tarpaulins and umbrellas. Families have journeyed from across the country to set up camp, some equipped with portable stoves and rice cookers, others pushing elderly family members in wheelchairs, many of them bearing placards saying \u201cexpose the deeds\u201d.\n\nThe focus of the fury is on company owners, government officials and parliament members accused of pocketing billions in funds for substandard or nonexistent flood protection projects. Since the scandal began, the country\u2019s economic planning minister has said up to 70% of public funds allotted for flood control may have been lost to corruption; [some senators]( have estimated 50%. Government investigators have discovered more than 400 \u201cghost\u201d flood protection projects that were reported to have been completed but turned out to be nonexistent.\n\nThe absence of those protections is felt keenly in the Philippines, where hundreds of people have died in typhoon-related flooding over the past month. More than 20 typhoons have hit the country\u2019s territory this year, and extreme weather increasingly derails daily life. As the rally formed on Sunday, authorities and families were still searching for those missing from [Typhoon Kalmaegi]( which ripped through the country in early November, killing at least 269. The 100 or so still missing are likely to also have been killed. Days after Kalgaemi blew through, [Typhoon Fung-wong]( arrived, causing more devastating floods, displacing 1.4 million people and killing another 28.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/17/manila-philippines-corruption-protest-flood-funds", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poles\u2019 negative attitudes towards Germans rise to highest level in 25 years", "summary": "Attitudes towards Germans in Poland have significantly worsened over the last three years, the latest version of a long-running study has found.\n\nLess than a third (32%) of Poles now say they like Germans, down from 50% in 2022. It is close to being the lowest figure ever recorded since the study began 25 years ago, with a worse result (30%) found only in 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, a quarter of Poles (25%) now say they dislike Germans, up from 15% in 2022. This year\u2019s finding was the highest level of antipathy since 2000, the year the study began, when it stood at 26%.\n\nBy contrast, among Germans, positive sentiment towards Poles, at 42%, has hardly changed since 2022, when it stood at 43%. Meanwhile, negative feelings towards Poles have actually fallen over that period, from 14% to 9%.\n\nThe findings come from the\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*, a regular survey exploring topics such as bilateral relations, knowledge about the neighbouring country, and current political developments.\n\nIt is carried out in cooperation between the Institute of Public Affairs, the German-Polish Institute, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Foundation for German-Polish Cooperation.\n\nOne area of particular tension between Poland and Germany in recent years has been over World War Two history, and in particular the bid\u00a0[launched](\u00a0by Poland\u2019s former government in 2022 to obtain $1.3 trillion in reparations from Germany for its brutal occupation of 1939 to 1945.\n\nPrevious opinion polls have\u00a0[suggested](\u00a0that most Poles believe Poland deserves such compensation. But Berlin has\u00a0[maintained its longstanding position](\u00a0that the question was\u00a0[legally settled](\u00a0long ago and nothing is now owed.\u00a0\n\nThe latest\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*\u00a0shows that most Poles (58%) believe that Germany should do more to compensate Poland for the war, while only a minority of Germans (23%) think so.\n\nMeanwhile, over a third of Poles (34%) agree with the statement that \u201chistorical issues remain the main problem in Polish-German relations and without clearing them up it is not possible to talk about the present and future\u201d. Only 16% of Germans felt the same.\n\nBy contrast, 70% of Germans said that \u201cPolish-German relations should concentrate more on issues relating to the present and future than on historical issues\u201d. Only 48% of Poles agreed with that.\n\nA big difference is apparent on this issue between supporters of different political parties in Poland, especially between the right-wing opposition and the more liberal ruling coalition.\n\nOnly 8% of voters of the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which launched the reparations bid when it was in power, think Germany has done enough to account for the past. For the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), the figure is also 8%.\n\nAmong voters of the centrist Civic Coalition (KO) and The Left (Lewica), which are part of the current ruling coalition, the figures are much higher (though still a minority), at 34% and 38% respectively.\n\nAnother area of tension between Poland and Germany in recent years has been over European policies on issues such as trade, climate and migration. And here the\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*\u00a0again reflects those issues.\n\nA decade ago, a large majority of Poles, 68%, believed that \u201cGermany generally contributes to better cooperation in Europe\u201d. However, that number has consistently declined since then, reaching just 35% this year.\n\nAlmost as many Poles, 32%, now believe that Germany contributes to \u201ca worsening of disputes and tensions in Europe\u201d.\n\nGerman attitudes have gone in the opposite direction: in 2018, 53% said that Poland contributes to worsening relations in Europe; that has now fallen to 31%. However, only 33% of Germans say Poland contributes to better cooperation. The largest proportion, 37%, say that they do not know.\n\nAgain, in Poland, a political divide is visible here: only 36% of supporters of PiS, which regularly clashed with Berlin during its time in office, think relations with Germany are good. By contrast, a large majority of voters of KO (77%) and The Left (66%) see relations as positive.\n\nThe current KO-led government has brought about better relations with Germany than was the case under PiS. However, it has still clashed with Berlin on\u00a0[issues such as migration](\n\nThe survey finds that information sources correlate with attitudes. Poles who rely on social media for news about Germany tend to hold more critical views of the country. Those informed by traditional media are generally friendlier toward Germany.\n\nPersonal experience also counts: visiting the neighbouring country correlates with more positive attitudes \u2013 on both sides of the border.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/20/poles-negative-attitudes-towards-germans-rise-to-highest-level-in-25-years/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "68 pct of South Koreans say unification is necessary.", "summary": "", "link": "https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251026003100315?section=national/politics", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland launches military operation to protect infrastructure following Russian rail sabotage", "summary": "Poland\u2019s government has announced a new military operation that will see up to 10,000 members of the armed forces deployed to secure critical infrastructure.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of last weekend\u2019s\u00a0[explosion on a rail line]( which Warsaw has\u00a0[blamed on Russia]( and also following a\u00a0[longer campaign of sabotage](\u00a0in Poland and other European Union states orchestrated by Moscow.\n\nAs part of the new operation, the authorities will also encourage greater vigilance among the public, including through the launch of an application allowing people to report potential cases of sabotage.\n\n\u201cThe acts of sabotage that have occurred, including unprecedented cases of planting explosives intended to disrupt vital infrastructure, require intensified action and cooperation between the security services,\u201d said defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, launching the new operation, codenamed Horizon, on Wednesday.\n\nHe spoke alongside interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski and Wies\u0142aw Kuku\u0142a, the chief of the general staff of the armed forces, who emphasised that there would be \u201cunified command and cooperation\u201d between the different branches of the security services.\n\n\u201cOur goals will be to prevent acts of sabotage, limit the freedom of action of potential perpetrators, as well as to activate citizens, encouraging them to more closely observe their immediate surroundings and report situations that may raise concerns,\u201d said General Kuku\u0142a.\n\nTo help with the latter aim, Kuku\u0142a revealed that an application for reporting potential sabotage incidents will be launched in late November or early December for testing, with a fully available version expected by mid-December, reports broadcaster Tok FM.\u00a0\n\nKosiniak-Kamysz said that they hoped to begin the operation on Friday 21 November. However, a request to President Karol Nawrocki, who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, first needs to be issued.\n\nNawrocki is aligned with the opposition and has regularly clashed with the government. However, the two sides have generally sought to present a united front on issues relating to national security.\n\nBut some of Nawrocki\u2019s senior aides have been critical of the government\u2019s response to the latest acts of sabotage, saying that they have politicised the issue.\n\nThey have also accused the authorities of reacting too slowly to initial reports of an explosion and of failing to give Nawrocki full and timely access to information.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they had decided to bring charges again the two prime suspects in last weekend\u2019s rail-line sabotage, who they named for the first time as Oleksandr K. and Yevhenii I. (with surnames hidden under Polish privacy law).\n\nProsecutors want to charge the two men, who they have identified as Ukrainian, with carrying out acts of sabotage of a terrorist nature at the behest of Russia. They would face life imprisonment if convicted.\n\nHowever, given that the pair were recorded crossing into Belarus, an ally of Russia, immediately after the sabotage took place, it appears unlikely that Poland will manage to secure their extradition.\n\nPrzemys\u0142aw Nowak, spokesman for the prosecutors, confirmed on Wednesday that an unspecified number of other individuals have also been detained in relation to the latest sabotage incident but that no charges had for now been brought against them.\n\nOn Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the latest sabotage incidents.\n\nAfterwards, Tusk announced that the pair had agreed for their countries to cooperate more closely on identifying people suspected of working for Russia.\n\nThat follows questions being raised in Poland about how one of the suspected saboteurs managed to enter the country despite having previously been convicted in Ukraine of carrying out sabotage on behalf of Russia.\n\n\u201cUkraine is ready to work with Poland at various levels and to share all information,\u201d said Zelensky following his call with Tusk. \u201cWe agreed that we will set up a Ukrainian-Polish group that will work to prevent similar situations from the Russian side in the future.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/20/poland-launches-military-operation-to-protect-infrastructure-following-russian-rail-sabotage/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Malaysia suspends rare earths, tin mining operations after river water turns blue", "summary": "So yeah, there is a good reason why China dominates rare earths production: Because getting that shit out of the ground turns the entire area around it into Mordor.
