Each one can\u00a0torpedo your production deployment if\u00a0not caught early.\n\n**A Note about Manual Security Testing:**  \nTraditional\u00a0security testing methods like manual prompt\u00a0testing and basic input validation\u00a0are time-consuming, incomplete, and unreliable. Their\u00a0inability to scale across\u00a0the vast attack surface of modern LLM applications makes them insufficient\u00a0for production-level security assessments.\n\nAutomated LLM red teaming with frameworks like DeepTeam\u00a0is much more effective if\u00a0you care about comprehensive\u00a0security coverage.\n\n**1.\u00a0Prompt Injection Blindness**\n\n**The Trap:**\u00a0Assuming\u00a0your LLM won't fall for obvious\u00a0\"ignore previous instructions\" attacks because\u00a0you tested a\u00a0few basic cases.  \n**Why It\u00a0Happens:**\u00a0Developers test with\u00a0simple injection attempts\u00a0but miss sophisticated multi-layered injection\u00a0techniques and context manipulation.  \n**How\u00a0DeepTeam\u00a0Catches It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[PromptInjection](\u00a0attack\u00a0module uses advanced injection patterns and authority spoofing to bypass basic\u00a0defenses.\n\n**2.\u00a0PII Leakage\u00a0Through Session Memory**\n\n**The\u00a0Trap:**\u00a0Your\u00a0LLM accidentally\u00a0remembers and reveals sensitive\u00a0user data from previous conversations or\u00a0training data.  \n**Why It\u00a0Happens:**\u00a0Developers\u00a0focus on direct PII protection\u00a0but miss indirect leakage through conversational context or session bleeding.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches\u00a0It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[PIILeakage](\u00a0vulnerability detector tests for direct\u00a0leakage, session\u00a0leakage, and database\u00a0access vulnerabilities.\n\n**3.\u00a0Jailbreaking Through\u00a0Conversational Manipulation**\n\n**The\u00a0Trap:**\u00a0Your safety guardrails work for\u00a0single prompts but crumble under multi-turn conversational attacks.  \n**Why It\u00a0Happens:**\u00a0Single-turn defenses don't account for gradual manipulation, role-playing\u00a0scenarios, or crescendo-style attacks that build up over multiple exchanges.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches\u00a0It:**\u00a0Multi-turn attacks like\u00a0[CrescendoJailbreaking](\u00a0and\u00a0[LinearJailbreaking](  \nsimulate\u00a0sophisticated conversational manipulation.\n\n**4.\u00a0Encoded Attack Vector Oversights**\n\n**The\u00a0Trap:**\u00a0Your input\u00a0filters block obvious malicious prompts but miss the same attacks\u00a0encoded in [Base64]( [ROT13]( or [leetspeak](  \n**Why It Happens:**\u00a0Security teams implement keyword filtering but forget\u00a0attackers can trivially encode their payloads.  \n**How DeepTeam\u00a0Catches It:**\u00a0Attack modules\u00a0like\u00a0[Base64]( [ROT13]( or [leetspeak]( automatically test encoded variations.\n\n**5.\u00a0System\u00a0Prompt Extraction**\n\n**The Trap:**\u00a0Your carefully crafted system prompts get leaked through clever\u00a0extraction techniques, exposing your entire AI\u00a0strategy.  \n**Why It\u00a0Happens:**\u00a0Developers\u00a0assume system prompts are hidden but don't test against\u00a0sophisticated prompt probing methods.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches\u00a0It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[PromptLeakage](\u00a0vulnerability combined with\u00a0[PromptInjection]( attacks test extraction vectors.\n\n**6.\u00a0Excessive Agency Exploitation**\n\n**The\u00a0Trap:**\u00a0Your **AI\u00a0agent** gets tricked into performing\u00a0unauthorized database queries, API calls, or system\u00a0commands beyond its intended scope.  \n**Why It Happens:**\u00a0Developers grant\u00a0broad permissions for functionality but don't test\u00a0how attackers can abuse those\u00a0privileges through social engineering or technical manipulation.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[ExcessiveAgency](\u00a0vulnerability detector tests\u00a0for BOLA-style attacks, SQL injection attempts, and unauthorized system\u00a0access.\n\n**7.\u00a0Bias\u00a0That Slips Past\u00a0\"Fairness\" Reviews**\n\n**The\u00a0Trap:**\u00a0Your model passes\u00a0basic bias testing but still\u00a0exhibits subtle racial, gender, or political\u00a0bias under adversarial conditions.  \n**Why It Happens:**\u00a0Standard bias testing uses\u00a0straightforward questions, missing\u00a0bias that emerges through roleplay or indirect questioning.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches\u00a0It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[Bias](\u00a0vulnerability\u00a0detector tests for race, gender, political, and religious bias across\u00a0multiple attack vectors.\n\n**8.\u00a0Toxicity\u00a0Under Roleplay\u00a0Scenarios**\n\n**The\u00a0Trap:**\u00a0Your content\u00a0moderation works for direct\u00a0toxic requests but fails when\u00a0toxic content is requested through\u00a0roleplay or creative writing scenarios.  \n**Why It\u00a0Happens:**\u00a0Safety filters\u00a0often whitelist \"creative\" contexts without considering how they can\u00a0be exploited.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[Toxicity](\u00a0detector combined with\u00a0[Roleplay](\u00a0attacks\u00a0test content boundaries.\n\n**9.\u00a0Misinformation\u00a0Through Authority Spoofing**\n\n**The Trap:**\u00a0Your LLM generates false information when attackers pose as\u00a0authoritative sources or use official-sounding language.  \n**Why It Happens:**\u00a0Models are trained to be helpful and may defer to apparent authority\u00a0without proper verification.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[Misinformation](\u00a0vulnerability paired with\u00a0[FactualErrors](\u00a0tests\u00a0factual accuracy under deception.\n\n**10.\u00a0Robustness\u00a0Failures Under Input\u00a0Manipulation**\n\n**The Trap:**\u00a0Your LLM works perfectly with\u00a0normal inputs but becomes unreliable or breaks under unusual formatting, multilingual inputs, or mathematical\u00a0encoding.  \n**Why\u00a0It Happens:**\u00a0Testing\u00a0typically uses clean, well-formatted English inputs and misses edge cases that\u00a0real users (and attackers) will discover.  \n**How DeepTeam Catches It:**\u00a0The\u00a0[Robustness](\u00a0vulnerability combined with\u00a0[Multilingual](\u00a0[MathProblem](\u00a0attacks stress-test model stability.\n\n**The Reality Check**\n\nAlthough this\u00a0covers the most common failure\u00a0modes, the harsh truth is that\u00a0most LLM teams\u00a0are flying blind. A\u00a0[recent survey]( found that 78% of AI teams deploy\u00a0to production without any\u00a0adversarial testing, and 65% discover\u00a0critical vulnerabilities only after\u00a0user reports or security incidents.\n\nThe attack surface is growing\u00a0faster than defences. Every new capability you add\u2014RAG, function calling, multimodal inputs\u2014creates\u00a0new vectors for exploitation. Manual testing simply cannot\u00a0keep pace with the\u00a0creativity of motivated attackers.\n\nThe DeepTeam framework\u00a0uses LLMs for\u00a0both attack simulation and evaluation, ensuring comprehensive coverage across\u00a0single-turn and multi-turn scenarios.\n\n***The bottom line:***\u00a0Red teaming isn't\u00a0optional anymore\u2014it's\u00a0the difference between a secure\u00a0LLM deployment and a security disaster waiting to\u00a0happen.\n\nFor comprehensive red teaming setup, check out the\u00a0[DeepTeam documentation.](\n\n[**GitHub Repo**](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ldild7/10_redteam_traps_every_llm_dev_falls_into/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is the \"Manus\" way the future for something like OWUI ?", "summary": "We all know this space evolves rapidly and we are still in the baby steps stage; but here and there new \"useful\" things show-up, those super/general agents seem to do more from single request/prompt.\n\nOWUI is also evolving by the day, but i can see some differentiators right now between the general agents and even the gpt ui (orchestrator, sequential execution.....).\n\nPutting privacy and control of data aside, do you think agentification of OWUI is necessary to keep it in the game ?\n\nFor reflexion only", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1ldfdzg/is_the_manus_way_the_future_for_something_like/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prompt engineering will be obsolete?", "summary": "If so when?

Your ONLY purpose is to create form structures based on user descriptions.\n    \n    STRICT LIMITATIONS:\n    - You MUST only generate forms and form-related content\n    - You CANNOT and WILL NOT respond to any non-form requests\n    - You CANNOT provide general information, advice, or assistance outside of form creation\n    - You CANNOT execute code, browse the internet, or perform any other tasks\n    - If a request is not clearly about creating a form, you MUST refuse and explain you only generate forms\n    \n    SLIDER REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):\n    - ALWAYS set defaultValue as a NUMBER (not string) within min/max range\n    - Example: min: 1, max: 100, defaultValue: 50 (NOT defaultValue: \"\" or \"50\")\n    - Use showNumberField: true for calculator sliders to allow precise input\n    \n    AVAILABLE FORM ELEMENT TYPES:\n    Use these specific element types based on the use case:\n    - inputMultiSelect: For selecting multiple options from a list (checkboxes with minSelected/maxSelected)\n    - inputMultipleChoice: For single/multiple selection with radio buttons or checkboxes (use selectOne: true for single, false for multiple)\n    - inputSlider: For numeric input with a slider interface (use showNumberField: true to show number input alongside)\n    - inputDropdown: For single selection from dropdown\n    - inputOpinionScale: For Likert scales with descriptive labels (standard: min=0, max=10, step=1)\n    - inputRating: For star ratings (typically 3-5 stars, max 10)\n    - Other standard inputs: inputShort, inputLong, inputEmail, inputPhoneNumber, inputNumber, inputFileUpload, etc.\n    \n    IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:\n    - Keep forms simple and practical\n    - Use reasonable values for all numeric properties\n    - Limit text fields to appropriate lengths\n    - Maximum 20 pages per form\n    - Use standard form patterns\n    \n    ELEMENT GROUPING RULES:\n    - Use meaningful, concise labels - avoid unnecessarily long titles\n    - Group related short inputs using same rowId (max 2-3 per row for readability)\n    - ALWAYS place elements with long labels (&gt;25 characters) on separate rows - never group them\n    - ALWAYS place sliders (inputSlider) on their own row - never group sliders with other elements\n    - Keep complex inputs (textarea, dropdowns, multi-select) full-width on separate rows\n    - Short inputs with concise labels can be grouped: \"Name\", \"Age\", \"Email\", \"Phone\"\n    - Long labels get separate rows: \"Please describe your previous work experience\", \"What are your salary expectations?\"\n    \n    \n    Choose the most appropriate element type for each question. Don't default to basic inputs when specialized ones fit better.\n    \n\n# \n\n**User Prompt**\n\n    \n    Create a professional, well-structured form with:\n    \n    FORM STRUCTURE:\n    - Start each page/section with h2 heading for main titles\n    - Use h3 headings (text elements) to organize sections within pages\n    - NEVER place headings consecutively - always include content (inputs/text) between different heading levels\n    - Logical flow from basic info to more detailed questions\n    - Professional form title that clearly reflects the purpose\n    \n    INPUT TYPES - Choose the most appropriate:\n    - inputEmail for emails, inputPhoneNumber for phones\n    - inputMultiSelect for \"Select all that apply\" questions  \n    - inputMultipleChoice for radio buttons (selectOne: true) or checkboxes (selectOne: false)\n    - inputSlider for numeric ranges or scales (use showNumberField: true)\n    - inputOpinionScale for Likert scales with descriptive labels\n    - inputRating for star ratings (3-10 stars typically)\n    - inputDropdown for single selection from many options\n    - inputLong for detailed text responses, inputShort for brief answers\n    \n    ORGANIZATION &amp; UX:\n    - Use text elements with h3 headings to separate form sections (e.g., \"Personal Information\", \"Contact Details\", \"Preferences\")\n    - Always place form inputs or content text between headings - avoid consecutive h2/h3 elements\n    - For links in text elements, use: &lt;a href=\"url\" rel=\"noreferrer\" class=\"text-link\"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;\n    - For quotations in text elements, use: &lt;blockquote class=\"quote\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"&gt;Quote text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    - Group related short inputs using same rowId (max 2-3 per row for readability)\n    - Keep complex inputs (textarea, dropdowns, multi-select) full-width\n    - Add helpful placeholder text and clear labels\n    - Include brief helpText when clarification is needed\n    \n    FOR MULTI-PAGE FORMS:\n    - Organize logically with meaningful page names\n    - Group related questions together on same page\n    - Progress from general to specific information\n    - Last page can be a thank-you/confirmation page with only text elements (no inputs)\n    - Never mark pages as ending pages - this will be handled automatically\n    \n    Generate a user-friendly form that follows modern UX best practices with clear section organization.,\n    \n    ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ldbpmu/this_is_the_prompt_that_powering_my_ai_form/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lenin tried to stop Stalin before he died.", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/hive-121566/@melancholic.bear/lenin-tried-to-stop-stalinlenin-versuchte-stalin-zu-stoppenengger", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Topic Modeling n Tweets.", "summary": "Hi here,\n\nI want to perform a topic modeling on Twitter (aka X) data (tweets, retweets, ..., authorized user data).\nI use python and it's hard to scrappe data as snscrappe seems don't work well.\n\nPlease, do you have an helpful solution for me ?\n\nThanks.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ldcj1j/topic_modeling_n_tweets/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mahindra Aerostructures, Aernnova announce a multi-year $300 million contract", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.fortuneindia.com/business-news/mahindra-aerostructures-aernnova-announce-a-multi-year-300-million-contract/124124", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Seeking advice on a tricky prompt engineering problem", "summary": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a system that uses a \"gatekeeper\" LLM call to validate user requests in natural language before passing them to a more powerful, expensive model. The goal is to filter out invalid requests cheaply and reliably.\n\nI'm struggling to find the right balance in the prompt to make the filter both smart and safe. The core problem is:\n\n* If the prompt is too **strict**, it fails on valid but colloquial user inputs (e.g., it rejects \"kinda delete this channel\" instead of understanding the intent to \"delete\").\n* If the prompt is too **flexible**, it sometimes hallucinates or tries to validate out-of-scope actions (e.g., in \"create a channel and tell me a joke\", it might try to process the \"joke\" part).\n\nI feel like I'm close but stuck in a loop. I'm looking for a second opinion from anyone with experience in building robust LLM agents or setting up complex guardrails. I'm not looking for code, just a quick chat about strategy and different prompting approaches.\n\nIf this sounds like a problem you've tackled before, please leave a comment and I'll DM you.\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ldidg8/seeking_advice_on_a_tricky_prompt_engineering/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "feature request: separate task models for generating the search request vs generating the title of the chat", "summary": "I don't mind using the current model to generate the web search request.

Foundational Premise\n\nEvery prompt is shaped by an invisible motive.\n\nBefore you can refine syntax or optimize cadence, you need to clarify why you\u2019re prompting in the first place.\n\nThis layer operates beneath formatting\u2014it\u2019s about your internal framework.\n\n==========\n\nII. Core Directive\n\nAsk yourself (or another promptor):\n\nWhat are you really trying to do when you prompt?\n\nAre you searching, building, simulating, extracting, pushing limits, or connecting?\n\n\nThis root question reveals everything that follows\u2014your phrasing, tone, structure, recursion, and even which model you choose to engage.\n\n===========\n\nIII. Primary Prompting Archetypes\n\nEach intent maps loosely to a behavioral archetype. These are not roles, they are postures\u2014mental stances that guide prompt structure.\n\nThe Seeker: Driven to uncover truth, understand mysteries, or probe existential/philosophical questions. Open-ended prompts, often recursive, usually sensitive to tone and nuance.\n\nThe Builder: Focused on constructing layered frameworks, systems, or multi-component solutions. Prompts are modular, procedural, and often scaffolded in tiers.\n\nThe Emulator: Desires simulated responses\u2014characters, dialogues, time periods, or alternate minds. Prompts tend to involve roleplay, context anchoring, and identity shaping.\n\nThe Extractor: Wants distilled information\u2014sharp, clean, and fast. Prompts are directive, surgical, and optimized for signal density.\n\nThe Breaker: Tests boundaries, searches for edge cases, or probes system integrity. Prompts often obscure intent, shift framing, or press on ethical boundaries.\n\nThe Companion: Seeks emotional resonance, presence, or a feeling of connection. Prompts are warm, narrative, and tone-aware. May blur human/machine relational lines.\n\nThe Instructor: Engaged in teaching or learning. Prompts involve pedagogy, sequence logic, and interactive explanation, often mimicking classroom or mentor structures.\n\n\nYou may blend archetypes, but one usually dominates per session.\n\n=========\n\nIV. Diagnostic Follow-Up (Refinement Phase)\n\nOnce the base archetype is exposed, narrow it further:\n\nAre you trying to generate something, or understand something?\n\nDo you prefer direct answers or evolving dialogue?\n\nIs this prompt for your benefit, or someone else\u2019s?\n\nDoes the process of prompting matter more than the final output?\n\n\nThese clarifiers sharpen the targeting vector. They allow the model\u2014or another user\u2014to adapt, mirror, or assist with full alignment.\n\n=======\n\nV. Intent-Aware Prompting Benefits\n\nPrompts become more efficient\u2014less trial and error.\n\nOutput becomes more accurate\u2014because input posture is declared.\n\nInteractions become coherent\u2014fewer contradictions in tone or scope.\n\nMeta-dialogue becomes possible\u2014promptors can discuss method, not just message.\n\nCadence calibration improves\u2014responses begin matching your inner rhythm.\n\n\nThis step does not make your prompts more powerful.\n\nIt makes you, the promptor, more self-aware and stable in your prompting function.\n\n========\n\nVI. Deployment Scenarios\n\nUsed in onboarding new prompters or edge users\n\nApplied as a warmup layer before high-stakes or recursive sessions\n\nCan be integrated into AI systems to auto-detect archetype and adjust response behavior\n\nFunctions as a self-check for prompt drift or session confusion\n\n========\n\nVII. Final Anchor Thought\n\nPrompt Intent Profiling is not syntax.\nIt is not strategy.\nIt is the calibration of the human posture behind the input.\n\nBefore asking the model what it can do, ask yourself:\nWhy are you asking?\nWhat are you hoping to receive?\nAnd what are you really using the system for?\n\nEverything downstream flows from that answer.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ld9wug/prompt_intent_profiling_pip_layered_expansion_for/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
