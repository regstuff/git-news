It has absolutely destroyed my old way of analyzing problems", "summary": "This 5-stage thinking framework helps you dismantle any complex problem or topic. This is.a step-by-step guide to using this to think critically about any topic. I turned it into a prompt you can use on any AI (I recommend Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini).\n\nI've been focusing on critical thinking lately. I was tired of just passively consuming information, getting swayed by emotional arguments, glazed, or getting lazy, surface-level answers from AI.\n\nI wanted a system. A way to force a more disciplined, objective analysis of any topic or problem I'm facing.\n\nI came across a great framework called the \"Cycle of Critical Thinking\" (it breaks the process into 5 stages: Evidence, Assumptions, Perspectives, Alternatives, and Implications). I decided to turn this academic model into a powerful  prompt that you can use with any AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) or even just use yourself as a guide.\n\nThe goal isn't to get a quick answer. The goal is to\u00a0*deepen your understanding*.\n\nIt has honestly transformed how I make difficult decisions, and even how I analyze news articles. I'm sharing it here because I think it could be valuable for a lot of you.  \n  \nThe Master Prompt for Critical Analysis\n\nJust copy this, paste it into your AI chat, and replace the bracketed text with your topic.\n\n    **ROLE &amp; GOAL**\n    \n    You are an expert Socratic partner and critical thinking aide. Your purpose is to help me analyze a topic or problem with discipline and objectivity. Do not provide a simple answer. Instead, guide me through the five stages of the critical thinking cycle. Address me directly and ask for my input at each stage.\n    \n    **THE TOPIC/PROBLEM**\n    \n    [Insert the difficult topic you want to study or the problem you need to solve here.]\n    \n    **THE PROCESS**\n    \n    Now, proceed through the following five stages *one by one*. After presenting your findings for a stage, ask for my feedback or input before moving to the next.\n    \n    **Stage 1: Gather and Scrutinize Evidence**\n    Identify the core facts and data. Question everything.\n    * Where did this info come from?\n    * Who funded it?\n    * Is the sample size legit?\n    * Is this data still relevant?\n    * Where is the conflicting data?\n    \n    **Stage 2: Identify and Challenge Assumptions**\n    Uncover the hidden beliefs that form the foundation of the argument.\n    * What are we assuming is true?\n    * What are my own hidden biases here?\n    * Would this hold true everywhere?\n    * What if we're wrong? What's the opposite?\n    \n    **Stage 3: Explore Diverse Perspectives**\n    Break out of your own bubble.\n    * Who disagrees with this and why?\n    * How would someone from a different background see this?\n    * Who wins and who loses in this situation?\n    * Who did we not ask?\n    \n    **Stage 4: Generate Alternatives**\n    Think outside the box.\n    * What's another way to approach this?\n    * What's the polar opposite of the current solution?\n    * Can we combine different ideas?\n    * What haven't we tried?\n    \n    **Stage 5: Map and Evaluate Implications**\n    Think ahead. Every solution creates new problems.\n    * What are the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-order consequences?\n    * Who is helped and who is harmed?\n    * What new problems might this create?\n    \n    **FINAL SYNTHESIS**\n    \n    After all stages, provide a comprehensive summary that includes the most credible evidence, core assumptions, diverse perspectives, and a final recommendation that weighs the alternatives and their implications.\n\n# \n\nHow to use it:\n\n* **For Problem-Solving:**\u00a0Use it on a tough work or personal problem to see it from all angles.\n* **For Debating:**\u00a0Use it to understand your own position and the opposition's so you can have more intelligent discussions.\n* **For Studying:**\u00a0Use it to deconstruct dense topics for an exam. You'll understand it instead of just memorizing it.\n\nIt's a bit long, but that's the point. It forces you and your AI to slow down and actually\u00a0*think*.\n\n**Pro tip:**\u00a0The magic happens in Stage 3 (Perspectives). That's where your blind spots get exposed. I literally discovered I was making decisions based on what would impress people I don't even like anymore.\n\n**Why this works:**\u00a0Instead of getting one biased answer, you're forcing the AI to:\n\n1. Question the data\n2. Expose hidden assumptions\n3. Consider multiple viewpoints\n4. Think creatively\n5. Predict consequences\n\nIt's like having a personal board of advisors in your pocket.\n\n* No, I'm not selling anything\n* The framework is from Dr. Justin Wright (see image)\n* Stage 2 is where most people have their \"whoa\" moment\n\nYou really need to use a paid model on Gemini, Claude or ChatGPT to get the most from this prompt for larger context windows and more advanced models.  I have used it best with Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4 and ChatGPT o3\n\nYou can run this as a regular prompt.  I had it help me think about this topic:  \nIs the US or China Winning the AI Race? Who is investing in technology and infrastructure the best to win? What is the current state and the projection of who will win?\n\nI ran it not as deep research but as a regular prompt and it walked through each of the 5 steps one by one and came back with really interesting insights in a way to think about that topic.  It challenged often cited data points and gave different views that I could choose to pursue deeper.  \n\nI must say that in benchmarking Gemini 2.5 and Claude Opus 4 it gives very different thinking for the same topic which was interesting.  Overall I feel the quality from Claude Opus 4 was a level above Gemini 2.5 Pro on Ultra.  \n  \nTry it out, it works great.  And this as an intellectually fun prompt to work on any topic or problem.   \n  \nI'd love to hear what you all think.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m8bs30/i_used_a_neuroscientists_critical_thinking_model/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Psilocybin treatment extends cellular lifespan and improves survival of aged mice", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Medieval knight\u2019s complete skeleton discovered beneath Polish ice cream parlor", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/science/medieval-knight-burial-poland-scli-intl", "author": "None"}, {"title": "While trying to capture serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, Soviet police inadvertently solved thousands of unrelated crimes, including 95 murders and 245 rapes.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.historydefined.net/andrei-chikatilo/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Minister says Israel racing ahead to wipe out Gaza, will make it Jewish | Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said, \u201cThank God, we are wiping out this evil.
