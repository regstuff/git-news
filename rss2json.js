Currently awaiting approval from my company to open-source this work, but wanted to share what we've built!\n\n  ## What It Does\n  Automatically syncs your entire Confluence spaces (or specific pages) to OpenWebUI knowledge bases, keeping your AI assistant up-to-date with your latest documentation.\n\n  ## Key Features\n\n  ### Core Sync Capabilities\n  - **Full Initial Sync** - Import entire Confluence spaces with one click\n  - **Incremental Sync** - Smart change detection only syncs modified content (SHA256 hashing)\n  - **Selective Sync** - Choose specific pages or entire page trees\n  - **Attachment Support** - Syncs files and media along with pages\n  - **HTML to Markdown** - Automatic content transformation for OpenWebUI\n\n  ### Multi-User &amp; Permissions\n  - **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Each user manages their own configurations\n  - **Role-Based Access** - Admin/User roles with granular permissions\n  - **Configuration Sharing** - Share sync configs with team members (Owner/Editor/Viewer)\n  - **JWT Authentication** - Secure API with token-based auth\n\n  ### Monitoring &amp; Management\n  - **Real-time Progress Tracking** - Live sync status with percentage complete\n  - **Sync History** - Detailed logs of all sync operations\n  - **Change Tracking** - See exactly what was added/modified/deleted\n  - **Terminal-style Log Viewer** - XTerm.js powered live log streaming\n  - **Scheduled Syncs** - Set it and forget it with configurable intervals\n\n  ### Technical Excellence\n  - **Async Architecture** - Non-blocking I/O with FastAPI\n  - **PostgreSQL + Redis** - Robust data persistence and task queuing\n  - **Retry Logic** - Exponential backoff for transient failures\n  - **Docker Ready** - One command deployment with docker-compose\n  - **Full API Documentation** - Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI docs\n\n  ## Tech Stack\n  - **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic\n  - **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Query\n  - **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+, Redis for task scheduling\n  - **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes ready\n\n  ## Use Cases\n  - Keep AI assistants updated with latest company documentation\n  - Automated knowledge base management for support teams\n  - Development documentation sync for engineering teams\n  - Compliance documentation management\n\n  ## Coming Soon\n  - WebSocket real-time updates\n  - Bi-directional sync\n  - Advanced filtering (by labels, authors, dates)\n  - Webhook support for instant sync triggers\n  - Multiple OpenWebUI instance support\n\n  ## Why We Built This\n  We had tons of documentation in Confluence but wanted to leverage OpenWebUI's AI capabilities. Manual copying was error-prone and time-consuming. This tool now runs 24/7, keeping everything in perfect sync with full audit trails.\n\n  Currently awaiting approval from my company to open-source this project. If approved, I'll share the repository with the community. Would love to hear if anyone else has similar needs or use cases!\n\n  Happy to answer any questions about the implementation!\n\n  ---\n  *Note: This is currently deployed internally.

So, I created this tool,\u00a0**LeetSolv**, which uses the SM-2 algorithm for scheduling. However, unlike the standard SM-2 algorithm which focuses on \"memorization\" (like Anki), I added some parameters such as \"problem importance\" and \"reasoning level\" to adjust the algorithm, making the scheduled review times more suitable for LeetCode practice.\n\nAdditionally,\u00a0**LeetSolv**\u00a0introduces a \"Due Priority Score\" to solve the problem of due reviews easily accumulating with SM-2, as users have different schedules and learning habits. This feature allows users to prioritize due problems based on their priority score.\n\nThis tool runs completely locally, requires no internet connection, and naturally, does not collect any data.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAfter solving over 190 LeetCode problems, I noticed an issue: my understanding wasn't always sinking in. I was just constantly moving forward, but the depth of my knowledge wasn't increasing.\n\nMy previous method was to star \u2b50\ufe0f difficult problems, but this wasn't reliable: as I improved, some starred problems became trivial, while other difficult ones were missed.\n\nI recalled my experience learning English: for vocabulary, flashcards and spaced repetition were very effective. But data structures and algorithms are different from memorizing words. Rote memorization is not the right way to learn DSA; it requires reasoning, practice, and reviewing concepts in different contexts. I couldn't simply use software like Anki to review DSA.\n\nTherefore, I created\u00a0**LeetSolv**\u00a0to solve my own learning problem: it's a review tool that schedules problem reviews like flashcards but adjusts the methodology for the specific nature of algorithm practice.\n\n", "link": "https://github.com/eannchen/leetsolv", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In 1965, a Scottish man named Angus Barbieri didn't eat for 1 year and 17 days.
