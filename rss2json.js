It doesn't exactly include measures on quality of information that's retained in the final summary.   \n  \nI quite like the metric used in this paper :  \n  \n\"Summarization. Following previous works (Kamoi et al., 2023; Zhang &amp; Bansal, 2021), we first\n\ndecompose the gold summary into atomic claims and use GPT-4o to check if each claim is supported\n\nby the generation (recall) and if each sentence in the generation is supported by the reference sum-\n\nmary (precision).
