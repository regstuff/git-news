Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.", "link": "https://x.com/KaitlynZhou/status/2023800965535789511", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China may approve Russian cancer vaccine Enteromix", "summary": "", "link": "https://thedailycpec.com/china-may-approve-russian-cancer-vaccine-enteromix/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Drone attack on busy market in Sudan kills at least 28", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/16/drone-strike-on-busy-market-in-sudan-kills-at-least-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kani TTS x0.6 RTF RTX 3060", "summary": "[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1r6xzn9/kani_tts_x06_rtf_rtx_3060/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cardinal Parolin: Holy See will not participate in Board of Peace", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2026-02/cardinal-parolin-holy-see-will-not-participate-in-board-peace1.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sahara autonomy plan revealed after Morocco-Polisario meeting", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newarab.com/news/sahara-autonomy-plan-revealed-after-morocco-polisario-meeting", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trum\u0440\u2019s New World Order Is Pushing Sweden to Warm Up to the Euro", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-16/sweden-is-warming-to-euro-adoption-thanks-to-trump-s-new-world-order", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh\u2019s new prime minister is sworn in after his party\u2019s landslide election win", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-election-tarique-rahman-yunus-fbc4222e01bbc5aa7ac120801218ef24", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz as it held latest round of indirect talks", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-iaea-dbed41b78ce2ddabc8a04349e72abeba", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Africa's Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen: How the tide turned against him", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6209vqv3nlo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Campaign targeting Jewish children's summer camps in Canada condemned as antisemitic", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/2026-02-16/ty-article/.premium/campaign-targeting-jewish-childrens-summer-camps-in-canada-condemned-as-antisemitic/0000019c-634c-de1a-a9df-6b7d990b0000", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
