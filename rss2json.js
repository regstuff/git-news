Here's what I found to be most interesting. (If you want more info, full down down available [here](\n\n* Many typical best practices still apply, such as\u00a0[few shot prompting]( making instructions clear and specific, and inducing planning via\u00a0[chain of thought prompting](\n* GPT-4.1 follows instructions more closely and literally, requiring users to be more explicit about details, rather than relying on implicit understanding. This means that prompts that worked well for other models might not work well for the GPT-4.1 family of models.\n\n&gt;Since the model follows instructions more literally, developers may need to include explicit specification around what to do or not to do. Furthermore, existing prompts optimized for other models may not immediately work with this model, because existing instructions are followed more closely and implicit rules are no longer being as strongly inferred.\n\n* GPT-4.1 has been trained to be very good at using tools. Remember, spend time writing good tool descriptions!\u00a0\n\n&gt;Developers should name tools clearly to indicate their purpose and add a clear, detailed description in the \"description\" field of the tool. Similarly, for each tool param, lean on good naming and descriptions to ensure appropriate usage. If your tool is particularly complicated and you'd like to provide examples of tool usage, we recommend that you create an\u00a0# Examples\u00a0section in your system prompt and place the examples there, rather than adding them into the \"description's field, which should remain thorough but relatively concise.\n\n* For long contexts, the best results come from placing instructions both before and after the provided content. If you only include them once, putting them\u00a0**before**\u00a0the context is more effective. This differs from\u00a0[Anthropic\u2019s guidance]( which recommends placing instructions, queries, and examples\u00a0**after**\u00a0the long context.\n\n&gt;If you have long context in your prompt, ideally place your instructions at both the beginning and end of the provided context, as we found this to perform better than only above or below. If you\u2019d prefer to only have your instructions once, then above the provided context works better than below.\n\n* GPT-4.1 was trained to handle agentic reasoning effectively, but it doesn\u2019t include built-in chain-of-thought. If you want chain of thought reasoning, you'll need to write it out in your prompt.\n\n\u200d\n\nThey also included a suggested prompt structure that serves as a strong starting point, regardless of which model you're using.\n\n&gt;\\# Role and Objective  \n\\# Instructions  \n\\## Sub-categories for more detailed instructions  \n\\# Reasoning Steps  \n\\# Output Format  \n\\# Examples  \n\\## Example 1  \n\\# Context  \n\\# Final instructions and prompt to think step by step", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k6yid7/openai_dropped_a_prompting_guide_for_gpt41_heres/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenWebUI Enterprise License", "summary": "Good morning,\n\nI'm looking to find out about the enterprise license that OpenWebUI offers but the only way to obtain it is to send them an email to their sales team.

The repo: [\n* Provides helpful structure, Gives you core building blocks for\u00a0agents (tools, memory, state) so you're not reinventing the wheel.\n* Built-in visual\u00a0debugging console\u00a0Connects\u00a0locally\u00a0to your running agent (no data leaves your machine) and\u00a0lets you visually trace the execution step-by-step, inspect messages, and see the flow (think n8n-style but\u00a0for agents).\n* LLM Agnostic\u00a0\u2014 Use models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, or\u00a0others. No vendor lock-in.\n* Multi-Agent Ready\u00a0\u2014 Supports building systems with supervisor/subagent patterns.\n\nAre there agent patterns or features you'd find useful in something like this?
