Follow these guidelines to ensure the content is thorough, engaging, and tailored to rank effectively:\n\n1. The content length should reflect the complexity of the topic.\n2. The article should have a smooth, logical progression of ideas. It should start with an engaging introduction, followed by a well-structured body, and conclude with a clear ending.\n3. The content should have a clear header structure, with all sections placed as H2, their subsections as H3, etc.\n4. Include, but not overuse, keywords important for this subject in headers, body, and within title and meta description. If a particular keyword cannot be placed naturally, don't include it, to avoid keywords stuffing.\n5. Ensure the content is engaging, actionable, and provides clear value.\n6. Language should be concise and easy to understand.\n7. Beyond keyword optimization, focus on answering the user\u2019s intent behind the search query\n8. Provide Title and Meta Description for the article.\n\n# HOW TO BOOST THE PROMPT (optional)\n\nYou can make the output even better, by applying the following:\n\n1. **Determine optimal content length**. Length itself is not a direct ranking factor, but it does matter, as usually a longer article would answer more questions, and increase engagement stats (like dwell time). For one topic, 500 words would be more than enough, whereas for some topics 5000 words would be a good introduction. You can research currently ranking articles for this topic and determine the necessary length to fully cover the subject. Aim to match or exceed the coverage of competitors where relevant.\n2. **Perform your own keyword research**. Identify the primary and secondary keywords that should be included. You can also assign priority to each keyword and ask ChatGPT to reflect that in the keyword density.\n\n# HOW TO BOOST THE ARTICLE (once it's published)\n\n1. **Add links**. Content without proper internal and external links is one of the main things that scream \"AI GENERATED, ZERO F\\*\\*\\*S GIVEN\". Think of internal links as your opportunity to show off how well you know your content, and external links as an opportunity to show off how well you know your field.\n2. **Optimize other resources.**\u00a0The prompt adds keywords to headers and body text, but you should also optimize any additional elements you would add afterward (e.g., internal links, captions below videos, alt values for images, etc.).\n3. **Add citations**\u00a0of relevant, authoritative sources to enhance credibility (if applicable).\n\nOn a final note, please remember that the output of this prompt is just a piece of text, which is a key element, but\u00a0**not the only thing that can affect rankings**. Don't expect miracles if you don't pay attention to loading speed, optimization of images/videos, etc.\n\nGood luck!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lb6wm3/an_actual_best_seo_prompt_for_creating_good/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can we share best practices here", "summary": "So far, I connect this with LiteLLM so I can use models from OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic for cheap.

Two I\u2019ve spent the most time with are ChatDOC and NotebookLM. Both are designed for AI-assisted document Q&amp;A, but they\u2019re clearly optimized for different use cases. Thought I\u2019d share my early impressions and see how others are using these, especially for literature reviews, research extraction, or QA across structured/unstructured documents.\n\n\n\nWhat I liked about each:\n\n\\- NotebookLM\n\n1. Multimedia-friendly: It accepts PDFs, websites, Google Docs/Slides, YouTube URLs, and even audio files. It\u2019s one of the few tools that integrates video/audio natively.\n\n2. Notebook-based structure: Great for organizing documents into themes or projects. You can also tweak AI output style and summary length per notebook.\n\n3. Team collaboration: Built for shared knowledge work. Customizable notebooks make it especially useful in educational and product teams.\n\n4. Unique features: Audio overviews and timeline generation from video content are niche but helpful for content creators or podcast producers.\n\n\n\n\\- ChatDOC\n\n1. Superior document fidelity: Side-by-side layout with the original document lets you verify AI answers easily. It handles multi-column layouts, scanned files, and complex formatting much better than most tools.\n\n2. Broad file type support: Works with PDFs, Word docs, TXT, ePub, websites, and even scanned documents with OCR.\n\n3. Precision tools: Box-select to ask questions, 100% traceable answers, formula/table recognition, and an AI-generated table of contents make it strong for technical and legal documents.\n\n4. Export flexibility: You can export extracted content to Markdown, HTML, or PNG\u2014handy for integration into reports or dev workflows.\n\nUse-case scenarios I've explored:\n\n\\- For academic research, ChatDOC let me quickly extract methodologies and compare papers across multiple files. It also answered technical questions about equations or legal rulings by linking directly to the source content.\n\n\\- NotebookLM helped me generate high-level thematic overviews across PDFs and linked Google Docs, and even provided audio summaries when I uploaded a lecture recording.\n\nAs a test, I uploaded a scanned engineering manual to both. ChatDOC preserved the diagrams, tables, and structure with full OCR, while NotebookLM struggled with layout fidelity.\n\n\n\nFriction points or gaps:\n\n1. NotebookLM tends to over-summarize, losing edge cases or important side content.\n\n2. ChatDOC can sometimes be brittle in follow-up conversations, especially when the question lacks clear context or the relevant section isn't visible onscreen.\n\n\n\nI'm also curious about: How important is source structure preservation to your RAG workflow? Do you care more about being able to trace responses or just need high-level synthesis? Anyone using these tools as a frontend for a local RAG pipeline (e.g. combining with LangChain, private GPT instances, etc.)?\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1laytnj/testing_chatdoc_and_notebooklm_on_documentbased/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shadcn easy install tool", "summary": "Checkout this shadcn easy tool.

I run this at home, and it is not the only system in my home - so I am trying to be mindful of total power load on my circuit. I was eyeballing the upcoming Radeon AI Pro cards, but the more I read - especially about layers and the like - the more confused I feel where the potential performance gains (t/s) would be. I haven't found an approachable way to just \"see\" the list of layers, what they are for, and thus understand what the -ot splits to llama-cpp are supposed to mean exactly.\n\nI am a notorious selfhoster and want to extend that to AI to have my own server to run as much inference as I want, possibly even using modelswapping to add more features as well.

Infer\u00eancia: A Ilus\u00e3o de Pensamento\n\n\\- Quando dizemos que o modelo \"pensa\", queremos dizer que ele realiza infer\u00eancias sobre padr\u00f5es lingu\u00edsticos.\n\n\\- Isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 \\*compreens\u00e3o\\* no sentido humano, mas uma previs\u00e3o probabil\u00edstica altamente sofisticada.\n\n\\- Ele observa os tokens anteriores e calcula: \u201cQual \u00e9 o token mais prov\u00e1vel que viria agora?\u201d\n\n\\--\n\n\ud83d\udd22 2. Previs\u00e3o de Tokens: Palavra por Palavra.\n\n\\- Um token pode ser uma palavra, parte de uma palavra ou s\u00edmbolo.\n\nExemplo: \u201cChatGPT \u00e9 incr\u00edvel\u201d \u2192 pode gerar os tokens: \\Chat\\, \\G\\, \\PT\\, \\\u00e9\\, \\in\\, \\cr\u00edvel\\.\n\n\\- Cada token \u00e9 previsto com base na cadeia anterior inteira.\n\nA resposta nunca \u00e9 escrita de uma vez \u2014 o modelo gera um token, depois outro, depois outro...\n\n\\- \u00c9 como se o modelo dissesse:\n\n\\*\u201cCom tudo o que j\u00e1 vi at\u00e9 agora, qual \u00e9 a pr\u00f3xima pe\u00e7a mais prov\u00e1vel?\u201d\\*\n\n\\--\n\n\ud83d\udd04 3. Cadeias de Contexto: A Janela da Mem\u00f3ria do Modelo\n\n\\- O modelo tem uma janela de contexto (ex: 8k, 16k, 32k tokens) que determina quantas palavras anteriores ele pode considerar.\n\n\\- Se algo estiver fora dessa janela, \u00e9 como se o modelo esquecesse.\n\n\\- Isso implica que a qualidade da resposta depende diretamente da qualidade do contexto atual.\n\n\\--\n\n\ud83d\udd0d 4. Import\u00e2ncia do Posicionamento no Prompt\n\n\\- O que vem primeiro no prompt influencia mais.\n\n\\&gt; O modelo constr\u00f3i a resposta em sequ\u00eancia linear, logo, o in\u00edcio define a rota do racioc\u00ednio.\n\n\\- Alterar uma palavra ou posi\u00e7\u00e3o pode mudar todo o caminho de infer\u00eancia.\n\n\\--\n\n\ud83e\udde0 5. Probabilidade e Criatividade: Como Surge a Variedade\n\n\\- O modelo n\u00e3o \u00e9 determin\u00edstico.

This is managed by a robust **Model Contet Protocol (MCP)** agent scaffolding designed for complex task execution.\n\n**Core Capabilities &amp; How LLMs Fit In:**\n\n1. **Intelligent Workflow Orchestration:**\u00a0The LLM, guided by the MCP, can:\n2. \u2022 **Plan and Strategize:**\u00a0Using a\u00a0SequentialThinkingPlanner\u00a0tool, the LLM breaks down high-level goals (e.g., \"assess [example.com]( for web vulnerabilities\") into a series of logical thought steps. It can even revise its plan based on incoming data!\n3. **Dynamic Tool Selection &amp; Execution:**\u00a0Based on its plan, the LLM chooses and executes appropriate tools from a growing arsenal. Current tools include:\n4. \u25c7 Port Scanning (PortScanner)\n5. Subdomain Enumeration (SubDomainEnumerator)\n6. DNS Enumeration (DnsEnumerator)\n7. Web Content Fetching (GetWebPages,\u00a0SiteMapAndAnalyze)\n8. Web Searches for general info and CVEs (WebSearch,\u00a0WebSearch4CVEs)\n9. Data Ingestion &amp; Querying from a vector DB (IngestText2DB,\u00a0QueryVectorDB,\u00a0QueryReconData,\u00a0ProcessAndIngestDocumentation)\n10. Comprehensive PDF Report Generation from findings (FetchDomainDataForReport,\u00a0RetrievePaginatedDataSection,\u00a0CreatePDFReportWithSummaries)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Contextual Result Analysis:**\u00a0The LLM receives tool outputs and uses them to inform its next steps, reflecting on progress and adapting as needed. The\u00a0REFLECTION\\_THRESHOLD\u00a0in the client ensures it periodically reviews its overall strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Unique MCP Agent Scaffolding &amp; SSE Framework:**\n* \u25c7 **The MCP-Agent scaffolding (ReConClient.py):**\u00a0This isn't just a script runner. The MCP-scaffolding manages \"plans\" (assessment tasks), maintains conversation history with the LLM for each plan, handles tool execution (including caching results), and manages the LLM's thought process. It's built to be robust, with features like retry logic for tool calls and LLM invocations.\n* **Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Real-Time Interaction (Rizzler.py,\u00a0mcp\\_client\\_gui.py):**\u00a0The backend (FastAPI based) communicates with the client (including a Dear PyGui interface) using SSE. This allows for:\n* \u25aa **Live Streaming of Tool Outputs:**\u00a0Watch tools like port scanners or site mappers send back data in real-time.\n* **Dynamic Updates:**\u00a0The GUI reflects the agent's status, new plans, and tool logs as they happen.\n* **Flexibility &amp; Extensibility:**\u00a0The SSE framework makes it easier to integrate new streaming or long-running tools and have their progress reflected immediately. The tool registration in\u00a0[Rizzler.py](\u00a0(@mcpServer.tool()) is designed for easy extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Interactive GUI &amp; Model Flexibility:**\n* \u25c7 A\u00a0**Dear PyGui interface (mcp\\_client\\_gui.py)**\u00a0provides a user-friendly way to interact with the agent, submit queries, monitor ongoing plans, view detailed tool logs (including arguments, stream events, and final results), and even download artifacts like PDF reports.\n* Easily\u00a0**switch between different Gemini models**\u00a0(models.py) via the GUI to experiment with various LLM capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Why This Approach?**\n\n* **Deeper LLM Integration:**\u00a0Moves beyond LLMs as simple Q&amp;A bots to using them as core components in an autonomous assessment loop.\n* **Transparency &amp; Control:**\u00a0The MCP's structured approach, combined with the GUI's detailed logging, allows you to see\u00a0how\u00a0the LLM is \"thinking\" and making decisions.\n* **Adaptability:**\u00a0The agent can adjust its plan based on real-time findings, making it more versatile than static scanning scripts.\n* **Extensibility:**\u00a0Designed to be a platform. Adding new tools (Python functions exposed via the MCP server) or refining LLM prompts is straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\n**We Need Your Help to Make It Even Better!**\n\nThis is an ongoing project, and I believe it has a lot of potential. I'd love for the community to get involved:\n\n* **Try it Out:**\u00a0Clone the repo, set it up (you'll need a\u00a0GOOGLE\\_API\\_KEY\u00a0and potentially a local SearXNG instance, etc. \u2013 see\u00a0.env\u00a0patterns), and run some assessments!\n* \u25aa **GitHub Repo:**\u00a0[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Suggest Improvements:**\u00a0What features would you like to see? How can the workflow be improved? Are there new tools you think would be valuable?\n* **Report Bugs:**\u00a0If you find any issues, please let me know.\n* **Contribute:**\u00a0Whether it's new tools, UI enhancements, prompt engineering, or core MCP agent-scaffolding improvements, contributions are very welcome! Let's explore how far we can push this agent-based, LLM-driven approach to security assessments.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm excited to see what you all think and how we can collectively mature this application.
