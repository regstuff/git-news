Was trying to train a model on kaldi using custom dataset. After following the documentation, model is trained, however the WER folder doesn't get generated. If anyone could suggest any resources or links to kaldi-related forums, it would be of great help!

I have two corpora: 1) containing 400-ish poems and 2) one containing 7000 journals in English. The latter contains some OCR errors. \n\nI want to detect text reuse of the poems in the journal texts. In a first step, I want to get some poem-journal candidates. In a second step, I want to feed these candidates to a generative LLM (or multiple) so it can perform an intertextuality analysis (i.e. write a report on reused text, allusions, mentions of the poet). The main objective is for the system to be a useful tool to historians, so in the end I want to have an expert historian evaluate the validity of the LLMs' response.\n\nI've currently split up the poems in lines, embedded them all in a chromadb with ColBert v.2 embeddings (which are more fine-grained as they also embed keywords/terms separately). I also split up the journals in 5-grams and am using them as query text to fetch relevant poem snippets. I only have 20 'gold standard' samples of 5-grams which were found manually to evaluate the retrieval step.\n\nAny tips on how I can develop/improve upon this system? :) ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1irqh27/information_retrievaltext_reuse_poems_and_journals/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Global aerospace firms turn to India amid Western supply chain crisis", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/global-aerospace-firms-turn-india-amid-western-supply-chain-crisis-2025-02-17/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lost in Time: First Roman Helmet Found in Denmark", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.archaeologs.com/n/lost-in-time-first-roman-helmet-found-in-denmark", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Introducing Atlas: A Self-Hosted CMMS for Maintenance, Work Orders, and Analytics (Over a Year in Development!)", "summary": "", "link": "http://github.com/grashjs/cmms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Argentina president accused of fraud over crypto crash", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9x9j89evxo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Don\u2019t expect Trump to keep the pressure on India over hit squads operating in Canada | RCI", "summary": "", "link": "https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2139876/modi-trump-assassination-plots", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Which countries lead in AI research?", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/d0hre6w9jqje1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India reassures Nepali students after suicide sparked protest", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-reassures-nepali-students-after-suicide-sparked-protest-2025-02-18/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "All of Anna Kendrick\u2019s earnings from \u201cWoman of the Hour\u201d were donated to assault victims", "summary": "", "link": "https://krtio.com/all-of-anna-kendricks-earnings-from-woman-of-the-hour-were-donated-to-assault-victims/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World first 50m all timber blade to be tested in wind turbine", "summary": "", "link": "https://woodcentral.com.au/world-first-50m-all-timber-blade-to-be-tested-in-wind-turbine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fish species thought to be extinct for 85 years rediscovered", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/researchers-rediscovered-elusive-fish-species-thought-extinct-85/story?id=118895751", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan targets renewable energy as main power source by 2040", "summary": "", "link": "https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20250218_B03/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MarketMonk - Stock tracking on every platform", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/brandonp2412/MarketMonk", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France, Senegal say in talks to arrange departure of French troops", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/france-senegal-say-talks-arrange-departure-french-troops-2025-02-12/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pro-Palestinian NGO seeks ICC arrest warrant for Israel\u2019s foreign minister", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/middleeast/ngo-seeks-icc-arrest-warrant-israel-saar-intl-latam/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Endangered Indian grey wolf gives birth to eight pups in Karnataka\u2019s first Wolf Sanctuary", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/endangered-indian-grey-wolf-gives-birth-to-eight-pups-in-karnatakas-first-wolf-sanctuary/article69115610.ece", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
