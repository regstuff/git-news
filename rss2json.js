For example statements like \"This study is empirical research.\" or \"This study is a review.\".\n\nI've tried doing this by splitting the abstracts into sentences and computing the cosine similarity with SBERT embeddings. I then took the top 3 sentences of every abstract, checked how relevant they are for the statement, and set the threshold to the decision boundary of what i identified as relevant or not relevant. This works okay for some of the statements (F1 between 0.7 and 0.8), but quite bad for others (between 0.1 and 0.5). Got any idea how this could be improved? Is there a specific way how statements/criteria need to be worded for good similarity measures?\n\nAnother approach i've tried is NLI with DeBERTa, where i take the abstract as premise and the statement as hypothesis. The problem with that is, that i get a lot of neutrals and some contradictory results that are clearly incorrect. My guess would be that the training data just doesn't have a focus on scentific articles. Is there maybe a good dataset i could use for fine tuning?\n\nEvery input is appreciated :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1j037ps/checking_statements_against_paper_abstracts/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In 1999, A waitress was tipped a lottery ticket and won $10 million.
