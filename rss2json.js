More traditional linguistic approaches, like formal semantics or formal grammars, seem to be in declining demand.\n\nMoreover, every time I check job postings, I mostly see positions for NLP engineers, AI engineers, data analysts, etc., all of which require strong programming skills, as well as expertise in machine learning and related fields. That\u2019s why I chose this university from the start\u2014it offered more courses in machine learning, mathematics, etc. And now that some courses, like NLP and ML, are more theoretical, I wanna  supplement my knowledge with more hands-on practice, like  Udemy courses or similar.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the thing, in my college, many of my classmates with humanities/linguistics backgrounds are not concerned with that and they always argue that it\u2019s not our role to become NLP engineers or expert programmers. \nThey claim that there are plenty of positions specifically for computational linguists, where programming and machine learning are just useful extras but not essential skills. So, they\u2019re shaping their study plans in a more theoretical direction\u2014choosing courses like formal semantics instead of more advanced classes in ML, advanced NLP etc...
