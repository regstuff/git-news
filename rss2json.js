Also wondering:\n\n* What kinds of NLP projects would be good to showcase in a portfolio?\n* How\u2019s the NLP job market these days? Is it better to go for more general ML roles?\n* What should I focus on when preparing for interviews \u2014 what kind of technical questions usually come up?\n* Any advice or tips from folks who\u2019ve made a similar switch?\n\nWould really appreciate any suggestions or experiences you\u2019re willing to share.

I graduated about 10 years ago from a decent state university-though of course I'm still paying on my loans-with a BA in Antrhopology, for a little bit I sought out Archaeolgy jobs, but unfortunately I just couldn't find anything that was viable at the time, especially without an advanced degree and more experience, perhaps I didn't look hard enough, who knows. I'm at a place in my life now though where I seriously want to revisit this and feel I am mentally and emotionally...if not financially, able to.\n\nI am from the U.S and still live here but genuinely want to leave. I know some German universities and likely many others around the world have very affordable and perhaps free tuition, even for immigrants. I speak German decently enough, hence why thats my first choice.\n\nI am hoping, however, I can gain some insight from someone else's experience, specifically going from the U.S. to elsewhere if possible, on seeking a master's or Doctorate, as well as the job market in wherever you ended up.\n\nI'm no particularly worried about how much I make, I really just want to be able to have a career I feel I can learn in and enjoy. All of my actual hands on experience is from University, for what thats worth, although I've held a few jobs requiring similar working conditions and functions as an excavation does. So, if someone has some insight I would love to hear!
