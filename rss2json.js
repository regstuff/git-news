Very narrow I know, but I do have backup plans.\n\nDo you guys have any recommendations for good comp ling or language technology MS programs in the US? European schools seem to have a lot of good programs too but since the OPT after F1 is crucial, it's gonna need to be a US school---but please correct me if I am at all mistaken or there are other options.\n\nEdit: Currently on my radar are UW, CU, and Brandeis.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fvp8vw/comp_linglanguage_technology_ms_programs_in_us/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran's Khamenei says Oct 7 was legitimate attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/israel-updates-escalation-israel-iran-world-oil-price-surge-1963680", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Google DeepMind hires key OpenAI Sora researcher for 'world simulator' project", "summary": "1/ Tim Brooks, research lead of the team behind OpenAI's Sora video generation system, is joining Google DeepMind to work on video generation and world simulators.\r\n\r\n2/ The head of Google Deepmind explicitly welcomes Brooks in the context of a \"world simulator\", which he describes as a \"long-held dream\".\r\n\r\n3/ OpenAI is said to be working on an improved version of Sora, but no release date has been set.
