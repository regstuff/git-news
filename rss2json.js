The courses are beginner friendly and as interactive as you'd like to make them. I'll share the links and descriptions of each course below.\n\n[Ancient Maya Art and Power](\n\nA course focused on how Maya rulers communicated their power through art. We'll discuss the Tikal-Calakmul conflicts, the importance of Pakal and Palenque, the lintels of Yaxchil\u00e1n, and the Sacred Cenote of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and its connections to the rest of Mesoamerica.\n\n[Maya Mythology in Ceramics](\n\nThis course discusses the creation, context, and mythology represented on Maya ceramic vessels. We will compare myths shown on pots with stories from the Popol Vuh, discuss the\u00a0*wahyoob*' creatures shown on vessels, and examine creation myths and \"just-so\" stories.\n\n[Teotihuacan: Where One Becomes a God](\n\nAn introductory course on the Central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. We'll cover how and when the city was built, who lived there, what we know about the \"collapse\" of Teotihuacan, and its lasting legacy for the Maya, the Aztec, and more.\n\n[Reading and Writing Maya Glyphs](\n\nThis is a beginner-level course on how to read and write Maya hieroglyphs. I co-teach this course with my colleague Julia Kausch, an artist who specializes in detailed replicas of ancient Maya glyphs and art. Participants will learn the basics of reading Maya glyphs and how to write glyphic phrases using a brush or a pen.\n\nCourses start next week (with the exception of the last one, which starts May 22nd). I have limited each course to 10 participants per group so that I can personalize the content, but I'll re-run each course throughout the summer for those who can't take the first round!\n\nHope to see you there,\n\nCatherine Nuckols, Ph.D.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ccwfz0/online_courses_about_the_ancient_maya_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018We\u2019re all judged by what we do at home\u2019 \u2014 India's dig as pro-Palestine student protests divide US", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/world/were-all-judged-by-what-we-do-at-home-indias-dig-as-pro-palestine-student-protests-divide-us/2057036/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World\u2019s billionaires should pay minimum 2% wealth tax, say G20 ministers \u2022 Brazil, Germany, Spain and South Africa sign motion for fairer tax system to deliver \u00a3250bn a year extra to fight poverty and climate crisis", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2024/apr/25/billionaires-should-pay-minimum-two-per-cent-wealth-tax-say-g20-ministers", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine\u2019s star brigade in dire state due to lack of weapons and its own mistakes", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-04-22/ukraines-star-brigade-in-dire-state-due-to-lack-of-weapons-and-its-own-mistakes.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Major cities in Mexico running out of water as extreme heat continues", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.upilink.in/major-cities-in-mexico-running-out-of-water-as-extreme-heat-continues-18621.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The US has started building its first genuine high-speed rail link; this one will connect Vegas with LA", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2427647-has-the-us-finally-figured-out-how-to-do-high-speed-rail/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Winston Churchill sits on the remains of Hitler's armchair (1945)", "summary": "", "link": "https://historysnapshots.substack.com/p/winston-churchill-sits-on-the-remains", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Ry\u014dy\u016b Kobayashi flies 291 meters through the air in landmark ski jump, but his effort wasn\u2019t \u2018in line with FIS regulations\u2019", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Ry\u014dy\u016b Kobayashi flies 291 meters through the air in landmark ski jump, but his effort wasn\u2019t \u2018in line with FIS regulations\u2019</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvc3BvcnQvcnlveXUta29iYXlhc2hpLXNraS1qdW1wLWljZWxhbmQtaW50bC1zcHQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvc3BvcnQvcnlveXUta29iYXlhc2hpLXNraS1qdW1wLWljZWxhbmQtaW50bC1zcHQ?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-25", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Brazil star Marta to retire from international soccer", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Brazil star Marta to retire from international soccer</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjYvc3BvcnQvbWFydGEtcmV0aXJlLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc29jY2VyLWJyYXppbC1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNC8yNi9zcG9ydC9tYXJ0YS1yZXRpcmUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1zb2NjZXItYnJhemlsLXNwdC1pbnRs?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-26", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Unexploded WWII bomb to be defused near German soccer stadium", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Unexploded WWII bomb to be defused near German soccer stadium</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjYvc3BvcnQvdW5leHBsb2RlZC1ib21iLW1haW56LXNvY2Nlci1zdGFkaXVtLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVZodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA0LzI2L3Nwb3J0L3VuZXhwbG9kZWQtYm9tYi1tYWluei1zb2NjZXItc3RhZGl1bS1zcHQtaW50bA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-26", "author": "None"}, {"title": "WADA to launch independent review into its handling of doping case involving Chinese swimming", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">WADA to launch independent review into its handling of doping case involving Chinese swimming</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjYvc3BvcnQvd2FkYS1yZXZpZXctZG9waW5nLWNoaW5hLXN3aW1taW5nLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-26", "author": "None"}]}}};
