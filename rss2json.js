My current setup is whatever is available on Colab Pro+, so I can probably use the 7b-12b range of models?\n\nMy main question is, which base model would be best for this task?

It brings sun-warmed tropical water to Europe and the Arctic, where it cools and sinks to form a deep return current. The Amoc was already known to be at its [weakest in 1,600 years]( as a result of the climate crisis.\n\nClimate models recently indicated that a [collapse before 2100 was unlikely]( but the new analysis examined models that were run for longer, to 2300 and 2500. These show the tipping point that makes an Amoc shutdown inevitable is likely to be passed within a few decades, but that the collapse itself may not happen until 50 to 100 years later.\n\nThe research found that if carbon emissions continued to rise, 70% of the model runs led to collapse, while an intermediate level of emissions resulted in collapse in 37% of the models. Even in the case of low future emissions, an Amoc shutdown happened in 25% of the models.\n\nScientists have warned previously that [Amoc collapse must be avoided \u201cat all costs\u201d]( It would shift the tropical rainfall belt on which many millions of people rely to grow their food, plunge western Europe into extreme cold winters and summer droughts, and add 50cm to already rising sea levels.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/28/collapse-critical-atlantic-current-amoc-no-longer-low-likelihood-study", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PHYS.Org: \"Ancient DNA solves Plague of Justinian mystery to rewrite pandemic history\"", "summary": "**NOTE:** A couple of [published]( [papers]( within the same article.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-08-ancient-dna-plague-justinian-mystery.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for CI-friendly chatbot evals covering RAG, routing, and refusal behavior", "summary": "We\u2019re putting a production chatbot through its paces and want **reliable, CI-ready evaluations** that go beyond basic prompt tests.
