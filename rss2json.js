Less than a decade ago, few would have thought it realistic that most countries in the world would ever agree to close loopholes for corporate taxation, institute a global minimum rate, and decide how to apportion the new tax take \u2014 set to be more than $200bn a year \u2014 among themselves.\n\nYet here we are. And if one miracle is possible, why not two? That is how we should look at recent stirrings of something similar: a multilateral effort to overhaul the flawed system for taxing super-rich individuals.\n\nIn February, the economist Gabriel Zucman \u2014 a scourge of wealthy tax optimisers everywhere \u2014 presented G20 finance ministers with a proposal for a global billionaire\u2019s tax, at the request of Brazil. Bras\u00edlia, which currently holds the group\u2019s presidency, is keen to move to the next stage of the global tax agenda, which could be to close the loopholes that allow the world\u2019s richest individuals to pay very little tax.\n\nZucman proposes an annual levy of 2 per cent of the wealth of the world\u2019s roughly 3,000 dollar billionaires. It is not quite a wealth tax as much as a hybrid between a wealth and income tax, premised on the idea that the ultra-rich find it easy to define their revenues out of any taxable categories (by keeping gains inside holding companies, for example).\n\nThe goal is to cut through the thickets of legal structures that let the super-rich minimise taxable income under national codes, by positing that these should not give rise to less income tax than 2 per cent of their net worth. Any income and wealth taxes actually paid would be deducted. \n\nFrance\u2019s finance minister has endorsed the idea, for the G20 and also at the European level. Ministers from not just Brazil, but South Africa, Spain and Germany have written in favour of it. \n\n[Full copy of the article](", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/1f1160e0-3267-4f5f-94eb-6778c65e65a4", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Demographic models predict end-Pleistocene arrival and rapid expansion of pre-agropastoralist humans in Cyprus", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318293121", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What are GGUF LLMs explained ", "summary": "", "link": "/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1cx860o/what_are_gguf_llms_explained/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "French Tiktok ban makes VPN usage soar in New Caledonia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/vpn/french-tiktok-ban-makes-vpn-usage-soar-in-new-caledonia", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Study reveals ancient Pyrenees farmhouse burned by Hannibal\u2019s forces", "summary": "", "link": "https://archaeologymag.com/2024/05/pyrenees-farmhouse-burned-by-hannibals-forces/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia \u201clikely\u201d behind fire that destroyed Warsaw shopping centre, says Tusk", "summary": "", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/05/21/russia-likely-behind-fire-that-destroyed-warsaw-shopping-centre-says-tusk/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France breaks with allies to back ICC after prosecutors seek arrest Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant amd 3 Palestinan leaders.
