It doesn\u2019t matter whether the victims are Ukrainians, Jews, Roma or Polish citizens who hold different views.\u201d\n\nUnder Polish law, inciting hatred based on national, ethnic, racial or religious differences or publicly insulting someone based on such differences are crimes punishable by up to three years in prison.\n\n[Police data](\u00a0show that, from the start of January to the end of July in 2025, 543 bias-motivated crimes were recorded in Poland. That was a 41% increase on the 384 such crimes reported in the same period of 2024.\n\n\u201cRaising awareness of diversity in its dimensions, including race, ethnicity and religion, as well as preventing and combating bias-motivated crimes, is a key element of the Polish police\u2019s operations,\u201d wrote the police at the time.\n\nData for the rest of 2025 are not yet available, but the figures from the first seven months of the year suggest that Poland was on track to have one of the highest annual numbers of reported hate crimes on record.\n\nOne community that has complained of growing hate is Ukrainians, who are by far the largest immigrant group in Poland, numbering around 1.5 million.\n\nLast month, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister\u00a0[called on Poland](\u00a0to impose \u201cfair and exemplary\u201d punishment on those who engage in xenophobic behaviour towards Ukrainians, following reports that a Ukrainian schoolgirl was subjected to abuse at a Warsaw school.\n\nIn December, \u017burek met at the justice ministry with Ukraine\u2019s ambassador, Vasyl Bodnar, and the president of the Ukrainian World Congress, Paul Grod, to discuss combating hate speech and disinformation, which have been stoked in Poland by Russian operatives.\n\nAt the meeting, \u017burek \u201creaffirmed Poland\u2019s commitment to supporting Ukrainian citizens\u201d and said that his ministry would develop new legal regulations and prosecutorial competences in combating hate crimes.\n\nAccording to OKO.pres, \u017burek\u2019s plans will see special hate-crime units set up at 11 district prosecutor\u2019s offices in cities around Poland as well as at four in Warsaw. Maciej M\u0142ynarczyk, a prosecutor who specialises in hate-speech cases, is expected to play a central role in the new system.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s failure to effectively respond to aggression motivated by nationality, religion, skin colour or sexual orientation harms society as a whole,\u201d M\u0142ynarczyk told OKO.press. \u201cIt increases tolerance for violence, reduces respect for the law, undermines social stability, and undermines national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state and society cannot afford to be defenceless in this area,\u201d he continued. \u201cA comprehensive solution is necessary: dedicated training and exchange of experience, a methodological manual, and a distribution of workload so that specialised prosecutors handle such cases frequently and quickly gain experience.\u201d\n\nLast year, the government also sought to expand Poland\u2019s hate crime laws so that they also include sexual orientation, sex/gender, age and disability as protected categories.\n\nHowever, then-President Andrzej Duda, who was aligned with the conservative opposition,\u00a0[refused to sign the measures into law](\u00a0and instead sent them to the Constitutional Tribunal (TK) for review. The TK, which is also aligned with the opposition, deemed the bill unconstitutional, thereby preventing it from coming into force.\n\nLast year also saw a dramatic rise in the visibility and popularity of radical-right leader Grzegorz Braun, whose political activity has centred around anti-Jewish, anti-Ukrainian and anti-LGBT rhetoric.\u00a0He\u00a0[finished a surprise fourth](\u00a0in the 2025 presidential election and his party has\u00a0[growing support](\u00a0in polls.\n\nIn December, Braun\u00a0[went on trial](\u00a0for his 2023 attack on a Jewish religious celebration in Poland\u2019s parliament. He is also being prosecuted for a range of other alleged crimes relating to his anti-Jewish, anti-Ukrainian and anti-LGBT actions.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/03/poland-to-clamp-down-on-hate-crime/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
