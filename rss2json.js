It's about understanding the systems behind them and speaking the same language as other professionals.\n\nThese 40 Agentic AI terms will help you communicate clearly, collaborate effectively, and navigate the world of Agentic AI more confidently.\n\n1. **LLM** \\- AI model that creates content like text or images, often used in generative tasks.\n2. **LRM** \\- Large Reasoning Models: built for complex, logical problem-solving beyond simple generation.\n3. **Agents** \\- AI systems that make decisions on the fly, choosing actions and tools without being manually instructed each step.\n4. **Agentic AI** \\- AI system that operates on its own, making decisions and interacting with tools as needed.\n5. **Multi-Agents** \\- A setup where several AI agents work together, each handling part of a task to achieve a shared goal more effectively.\n6. **Vertical Agents** \\- Agents built for a specific field like legal, healthcare, or finance, so they perform better in those domains.\n7. **Agent Memory** \\- The capacity of an AI agent to store and retrieve past data in order to enhance how it performs tasks\n8. **Short-Term Memory** \\- A form of memory in AI that holds information briefly during one interaction or session.\n9. **Long-Term Memory** \\- Memory that enables an AI to keep and access information across multiple sessions or tasks. What we see in ChatGPT, Claude, etc.\n10. **Tools** \\- External services or utilities that an AI agent can use to carry out specific tasks it can't handle on its own. Like web search, API calls, or querying databases.\n11. **Function Calling** \\- Allows AI agents to dynamically call external functions based on the requirements of a specific task.\n12. **Structured Outputs** \\- A method where AI agents or models are required to return responses in a specific format, like JSON or XML, so their outputs can be reliably used by other systems, tools or can be just copy/pasted elsewhere.\n13. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** \\- A technique where model pulls in external data to enrich its response and improve accuracy or get a domain expertise.\n14. **Agentic RAG** \\- An advanced RAG setup where the AI agent(s) chooses on its own when to search for external information and how to use it.\n15. **Workflows** \\- Predefined logic or code paths that guide how AI system, models and tools interact to complete tasks.\n16. **Routing** \\- A strategy where an AI system sends parts of a task to the most suitable agent or model based on what's needed.\n17. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** \\- A protocol that allows AI agents to connect with external tools and data sources using a defined standard, like how USB-C lets devices plug into any compatible port.\n18. **Reasoning** \\- AI models that evaluate situations, pick tools, and plan multi-step actions based on context.\n19. **HITL (Human-In-The-Loop)** \\- A design where humans stay involved in decision-making to guide the AI's choices.\n20. **Reinforcement Learning** \\- Method of training where AI learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties.\n21. **RLHF** **(Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** \\- Uses human feedback to shape the model's behavior through rewards and punishments.\n22. **Continual Pretraining** \\- A training method where AI model improves by learning from large sets of new, unlabeled data.\n23. **Supervised Fine-Tuning** \\- Training AI model with labeled data to specialize in specific tasks and improve performance.\n24. **Distillation** \\- Compressing a large AI's knowledge into a smaller model by teaching it to mimic predictions.\n25. **MoE (Mixture of Experts)** \\- A neural network model setup that directs tasks to the most suitable sub-models for better speed and accuracy.\n26. **Alignment** \\- The final training phase to align model's actions with human ethics and safety requirements. QA for values and safety.\n27. **Post-Training** \\- Further training of a model after its initial build to improve alignment or performance. Pretty same what's **Alignment.**\n28. **Design Patterns** \\- Reusable blueprints or strategies for designing effective AI agents.\n29. **Procedural Memory** \\- AI's ability to remember how to perform repeated tasks, like following a specific process or workflow it learned earlier.\n30. **Cognitive Architecture** \\- The overall structure that manages how an AI system processes input, decides what to do, and generates output.\n31. **CoT (Chain of Thought)** \\- A reasoning strategy where an AI agent/model explains its thinking step-by-step, making it easier to understand and improving performance.\n32. **Test-Time Scaling** \\- A technique that lets an AI agent adjust how deeply it thinks at runtime, depending on how complex the task is.\n33. **ReAct** \\- An approach where an AI agent combines reasoning and acting. First thinking through a problem, then deciding what to do.\n34. **Reflection** \\- A method where an AI agent looks back at its previous choices to improve how it handles similar tasks in the future.\n35. **Self-Healing** \\- When an AI agent identifies its own errors and fixes them automatically. No human involvement or help needed.\n36. **LLM Judge** \\- A dedicated model that evaluates the responses of other models or agents to ensure quality and correctness. Think like a QA agents.\n37. **Hybrid Models** \\- Models that blend fast and deep thinking. Adapting their reasoning depth depending on how hard the problem is.\n38. **Chaining** \\- A method where an AI agent completes a task by breaking it into ordered steps and handling them one at a time.\n39. **Orchestrator** \\- A coordinator that oversees multiple AI agents, assigning tasks and deciding who does what and when. Think about it as a manager of agents.\n40. **Overthinking** \\- When an AI agent spends too much time or uses excessive tokens to solve a task often fixed by limiting how deeply it reasons.\n\nThis should be valuable!

Seeking prompt engineering advice.", "summary": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m building a tool that generates 30-day challenge plans based on self-help books. Users input the book they\u2019re reading, their personal goal, and what they feel is stopping them from reaching it. The tool then generates a full 30-day sequence of daily challenges designed to help them take action on what they\u2019re learning.\n\nI structured the output into four phases:\n\n1. Days 1\u20135: Confidence and small wins\n2. Days 6\u201315: Real-world application\n3. Days 16\u201325: Mastery and inner shifts\n4. Days 26\u201330: Integration and long-term reinforcement\n\nEach daily challenge includes a task, a punchy insight, 3 realistic examples, and a \u201cwhy this works\u201d section tied back to the book\u2019s philosophy.\n\nEven with all this structure, the API output from GPT-4o still feels generic. It doesn\u2019t hit the same way it does when I ask the same prompt inside the ChatGPT UI. It misses nuance, doesn\u2019t use the follow-up input very well, and feels repetitive or shallow.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried:\n\n* Splitting generation into smaller batches (1 day or 1 phase at a time)\n* Feeding in super specific examples with format instructions\n* Lowering temperature, playing with top\\_p\n* Providing a real user goal + blocker in the prompt\n\nStill not getting results that feel high-quality or emotionally resonant. The strange part is, when I paste the exact same prompt into the ChatGPT interface, the results are way better.\n\nHas anyone here experienced this? And if so, do you know:\n\n1. Why is the quality different between ChatGPT UI and the API, even with the same model and prompt?\n2. Are there best practices for formatting or structuring API calls to match ChatGPT UI results?\n3. Is this a model limitation, or could Claude or Gemini be better for this type of work?\n4. Any specific prompt tweaks or system-level changes you\u2019ve found helpful for long-form structured output?\n\nAppreciate any advice or insight.\n\nThanks in advance.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k2fsyd/why_does_gpt4o_via_api_produce_generic_outputs/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Recurra is a Python-powered, terminal-based loop player for generative musicians, live coders, and AI-assisted creators.

I was planning to go into archaeology but have been questioning it lately and it's causing a major freakout. Like, to the extent that I might say screw it all and spend the next 3 years trying to be a mechanical engineering major. For reference, I'm in the western US.\n\n1. I'm considered that funding cuts will make it extremely difficult to work in CRM.\n\n2. I'm considered about upwards mobility in CRM. The job postings I've seen that are livable wages require 8+ years of experience and a higher degree. I was planning on getting a masters at some point, but I also want to pay my bills before that point. And I haven't done field school yet (doing it this summer hopefully), and I'm so afraid I'll hate field work and then be graduated with this degree and have no options that are interesting to me. Or that I sort of like field work, but not enough to do it for a low-paying, unstable, lonely job for many years. \n\n3. The instability of the work. I'm scared I won't be able to make friends or form relationships if I'm doing field work long-term. I'm scared it's not a viable long-term career path. Especially since I realized I do care about making enough money. Will that happen if I spend enough time in archaeology and get the required higher degrees (planning on a masters + GIS cert) ? \n\nI'm just generally freaking out about everything. Has anyone been in this position? Can anyone give advice? Anything is helpful. Thanks.
