The performance metrics alone are worth discussing.\n\n# What We Know So Far\n\n**AIME accuracy jumped from 70% to 87.5%,** 17.5 percentage point improvement that puts this model in the same performance tier as OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro for mathematical reasoning. For context, AIME problems are competition-level mathematics that challenge both AI systems and human mathematicians.\n\n**Token usage increased to \\~23K per query on average**, which initially seems inefficient until you consider what this represents - the model is engaging in deeper, more thorough reasoning processes rather than rushing to conclusions.\n\n**Hallucination rates reportedly down** with improved function calling reliability, addressing key limitations from the previous version.\n\n**Code generation improvements** in what's being called \"vibe coding\" - the model's ability to understand developer intent and produce more natural, contextually appropriate solutions.\n\n# Competitive Positioning\n\nThe benchmarks position R1-0528 directly alongside top-tier closed-source models. On LiveCodeBench specifically, it outperforms Grok-3 Mini and trails closely behind o3/o4-mini. This represents noteworthy progress for open-source AI, especially considering the typical performance gap between open and closed-source solutions.\n\n# Deployment Options Available\n\n**Local deployment**: Unsloth has already released a 1.78-bit quantization (131GB) making inference feasible on RTX 4090 configurations or dual H100 setups.\n\n**Cloud access**: Hyperbolic and Nebius AI now supports R1-0528, You can try [here]( for immediate testing without local infrastructure.\n\n# Why This Matters\n\nWe're potentially seeing genuine performance parity with leading closed-source models in mathematical reasoning and code generation, while maintaining open-source accessibility and transparency. The implications for developers and researchers could be substantial.\n\nI've written a detailed analysis covering the release benchmarks, quantization options, and potential impact on AI development workflows.

The defense budget gap vs India is widening day by day: In 2000, the defense budget of two countries was $12 Bn vs $ 4Bn (so India was 3x), in 2024 it was $75 Bn vs $7.5 Bn (India has 10x budget).\n\n2. And yet, their economy cannot sustain any war / war like situation: What strikes me most is 50-60% of their revenue is going to interest payments, and 30% to defense. So practically, the govt is running based on freshly borrowed money\n\n**So in no way they can catch up on spending**\n\n3. But, India paranoia rages on: Average Pakistani believes firmly that India is out there to get them, and thus they need to be able to defend themselves. The jubilation after the ceasefire showed the collective sigh of relief the population took. \n\n4. And further, they have no strategic depth: Pakistan is like a long strip along the Indus river with every major population center pretty much a few hundred km (mostly even less) than India\u2019s borders. On the other side there\u2019s massive desert or high mountains. Their entire coastline opens up to Arabian sea, which can easily be blockaded. So essentially they DO NOT have any strategic depth. Their decades long plan of building depth into Afghanistan has failed rather spectacularly. \n\n**So its a precarious position vis-a-vis defense of the country. If I were a Pakistan\u2019s PM, this is something that would definitely keep me up at night. **\n\nAnd yet, **their military spend is geared far more towards offensive action than defensive. And this doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026**\n\n1. Large stock of the F16, J10C and now an upcoming order of J35s : Expensive pieces necessary for offensive action, like dogfights etc. but of rather limited use in defensive actions. Further, they form a very high value targets for enemies. As seen by damages to Hangers of their Bholari air base. \n\n2. No credible air defense: enough has been said about this, that they had NO working AD. There\u2019s some news about upcoming order of HQ19 air defense, but seems to me too late and too incompetent given its anti ballistic nature (and limited use against cruise missiles)\n\n3. Navy blockaded rather easily: No mechanism to break the blockade by Indian Navy around Karachi port \n\nSo the real question is: **why does Pakistan invest so much in such offensive assets and so little in defensive.** \n\n**Isn\u2019t it a better strategy be to defend aggressively,  and/or seek a better relationship with India before its too late.**\n\n**If this is not hubris then what is!**\n\nMake it make sense to me.

Historical and Cultural Ties\n\nIndia and Bhutan share deep historical and cultural links\n\nPeople-to-people connections and religious pilgrimages have helped create a foundation of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nAlso, Bhutan is the ONLY stable and safe country in entire South Asia \n\n\n2. 1949 Treaty of Friendship\n\nIndia and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Friendship in 1949, which laid the groundwork for close diplomatic relations.\n\nThe treaty was revised in 2007 to give Bhutan more autonomy while reaffirming strong cooperation, especially in foreign policy, defense, and security.\n\n\n3. Strategic and Security Cooperation\n\nBhutan is geopolitically important for India, especially given its location between India and China.\n\nIndia helps Bhutan with military training, defense support, and border security.\n\nDuring the 2017 Doklam standoff, India supported Bhutan against Chinese attempts to build a road on disputed territory, strengthening Bhutan\u2019s trust in India.\n\n\n4. Economic Support and Development Aid\n\nIndia is Bhutan\u2019s largest trading partner and the main source of foreign aid.\n\nIndia supports Bhutan in major sectors like education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nBhutan\u2019s key hydropower projects have been developed with Indian investment, and India buys surplus electricity from Bhutan.\n\n\n5. Mutual Trust and Respect\n\nBhutan values its independence but maintains a strong and balanced friendship with India.\n\nUnlike many international relationships, the India-Bhutan partnership is marked by non-interference, cooperation, and long-term commitment.\n\n\n6. People-to-People Relationships\n\nVisa-free travel for citizens of both countries has helped strengthen ties.\n\nMany Bhutanese students study in Indian institutions, and Indian professionals work in Bhutan.\n\n\nIt wouldn't be an exagerration if we draw parallels between Indo-Bhutan relations and Pre Trump US-Canada relations\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1kz4tj5/whom_do_you_think_is_the_greatest_ally_of_india/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anyone have any experience in designing the prompt architecture for an AI coding agent?", "summary": "Hi! Hope this is appropiate :) \n\n  \nLong story short, we are building (and using!) and AI coding Agent that uses Claude Code.
