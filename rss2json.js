However, after training and when testing the model (exported model and run on llama.cpp), I notice that the model will more often than not end up repeating a sentence or two endlessly (e.g. in the reasoning CoT, model gets \u201cstuck\u201d and endlessly repeats a line, for example \u201cstep 10: {some math calculation}\\nstep 10: {some math calculation}\\n\u2026 \u201c, or something like sentence1\\nsentence2\\nsentence1\u2026 etc.) on a prompt.\n\nI\u2019ve tried training from the qwen3 4b base model and the 2507 instruct variant (thinking that maybe since the instruct is trained for instruction following and already \u201cunderstands\u201d the chat template but to no avail). I\u2019ve also rented an a100 for a bit to see if a larger model (qwen3-30b) would have same issue, but seems like I run into the same problem.\n\nI\u2019ve currently been using a custom synthetically generated dataset with 665 rows, with approx. 30pct of them being general conversational text and the other 70% being domain specific questions (in this case mostly math and code related questions), in the same format the unsloth/openmathreasoning-mini dataset used as a primer dataset. Settings for that part is left basically default (num epoch set to 2, etc). The GRPO trainer after uses dataset with both code and mathematical questions, with similar reward functions to the original notebook, with mathematical questions graded on correctness and code based on how much testcases passed (I\u2019ve also added a reward function to penalize constant repeat of lines), and I\u2019ve trained for about 500 steps.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed a few issues similar to this, but the mentioned fixes seem to always be related to chat template issues, whereas my fine tuned model will have this issue sometimes but not always. I have been experimenting with using the qwen3 chat template with tool call support, but the issue is present on the base chatML style chat template used during finetuning as well.\n\nI\u2019m curious on any ideas how I can solve this issue. I\u2019ve tried presence/repeat/frequency penalty, but it doesn\u2019t really work out and ultimately is only a bandaid fix. Is the \u201cprimer\u201d dataset too large or overfitting the model? Do I need to run the GRPO trainer for more steps? I\u2019m running it for \u201conly\u201d about 500 steps, is this too little/not enough? Should the dataset for my GRPO trainer be more diverse? \n\nI\u2019m only a traditional programmer and have only dabbled in computer vision before, a bit lost in LLM training lol, any suggestions and help would be extremely appreciated.

The vision is often too broad, or the technical path isn't clear. Based on my experience building and deploying these systems in a regulated environment, here is a pragmatic, step-by-step framework.\n\nA Focused Methodology for AI Agent Deployment\n\nThe most common pitfall is overreaching with the initial project. Instead of trying to build a \"universal\" financial assistant, your first step should be to target a very specific, high-value business problem. Think of it as automating a single, repetitive task within a larger workflow. For example, instead of \"AI for compliance,\" focus on \"an agent that flags suspicious transactions based on a specific set of parameters.\" A narrowly defined problem is far easier to build, test, and prove its value.\n\nAfter defining the scope, the next steps are a logical progression:\n\nSelect the Right LLM: The LLM serves as the agent's core reasoning engine. Your choice depends on your security and operational requirements. Consider the trade-offs between using a commercial API for quick development and a self-hosted or open-source model, which offers greater control over sensitive financial data.\n\nDefine the Agent's Action and Interaction Layer: An agent's value is in its ability to act on its reasoning. You need to establish the connection points to your firm's existing systems. This might involve integrating with internal APIs for processing transactions, accessing real-time market data feeds, or interacting with secure document management systems. This layer is what allows the agent to move from analysis to action.\n\nConstruct the Core Agentic Loop: This is the heart of any successful agent. The process is a continuous cycle: the agent perceives new information (e.g., an incoming transaction), reasons on that data using the LLM and its internal logic (e.g., \"is this a known fraud pattern?\"), and then acts by calling an external tool or API (e.g., creating a flag in the transaction monitoring system). This loop ensures the agent is responsive and goal-oriented.\n\nEstablish a Context Management System: Agents need a memory to operate effectively within a conversation or workflow. For a first project, focus on a short-term, session-based context. This means the agent remembers the immediate details of a specific request or interaction, without needing a complex, long-term knowledge base. This reduces complexity and is often sufficient for most targeted financial tasks.\n\nDesign an Efficient User Interface: The agent's final output needs to be accessible to end-users, like analysts or risk managers. The interface should be intuitive and should not require technical expertise. A simple internal dashboard, a secure Slack or Microsoft Teams bot, or even an email alert system can serve this purpose. The goal is to seamlessly integrate the agent's output into the existing workflow.\n\nAdopt an Iterative Development Methodology: In finance, trust is paramount. You build it by starting with a small prototype, rigorously testing it with real-world, non-production data, and then refining it in rapid, continuous cycles. This approach allows you to identify and fix issues early, ensuring the agent is reliable and performs as expected before it's ever deployed into a production environment.\n\nfocusing on this disciplined, incremental approach, you can successfully build and deploy a valuable AI agent that not only works but also demonstrates a clear return on investment. The first successful project will provide the blueprint for building even more sophisticated agents down the line.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1myvovb/building_ai_agents_strategic_approach_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Number 1 prompt guide", "summary": "Where is the most comprehensive updated guide on prompting?
