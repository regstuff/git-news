Prompting = Interface Design**\n\nIf you treat a prompt like a wish, you get junk  \nIf you treat it like you're onboarding a dev intern, you get results\n\nBad prompt: build me a dashboard with login and user settings\n\nBetter prompt: you\u2019re my React assistant. we\u2019re building a dashboard in Next.js. start with just the sidebar. use shadcn/ui components. don\u2019t write the full file yet \u2014 I\u2019ll prompt you step by step.\n\nI write prompts like I write tickets. Scoped, clear, role-assigned\n\n**2. Waterfall Prompting &gt; Monologues**\n\nInstead of asking for everything up front, I lead the model there with small, progressive prompts.\n\nExample:\n\n1. what is y combinator?\n2. do they list all their funded startups?\n3. which tools can scrape that data?\n4. what trends are visible in the last 3 batches?\n5. if I wanted to build a clone of one idea for my local market, what would that process look like?\n\nSame idea for debugging:\n\n* what file controls this behavior?\n* what are its dependencies?\n* how can I add X without breaking Y?\n\nBy the time I ask it to build, the model knows where we\u2019re heading\n\n**3. AI as a Team, Not a Tool**\n\ncraft many chats within one project inside your LLM for:\n\n\u2192 planning, analysis, summarization  \n\u2192 logic, iterative writing, heavy workflows  \n\u2192 scoped edits, file-specific ops, PRs  \n\u2192 layout, flow diagrams, structural review\n\nEach chat has a lane. I don\u2019t ask Developer to write Tailwind, and I don\u2019t ask Designer to plan architecture\n\n**4. Always One Prompt, One Chat, One Ask**\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a 200-message chat thread, GPT will start hallucinating  \nI keep it scoped:\n\n* one chat = one feature\n* one prompt = one clean task\n* one thread = one bug fix\n\nShort. Focused. Reproducible\n\n**5. Save Your Prompts Like Code**\n\nI keep a [prompt-library.md]( where I version prompts for:\n\n* implementation\n* debugging\n* UX flows\n* testing\n* refactors\n\nIf a prompt works well, I save it. Done.\n\n**6. Prompt iteratively (not magically)**\n\nLLMs aren\u2019t search engines. they\u2019re pattern generators.\n\nso give them better patterns:\n\n* set constraints\n* define the goal\n* include examples\n* prompt step-by-step\n\nthe best prompt is often... the third one you write.\n\n**7.

This is just an opinion and very speculative at that. Feel free to agree or disagree.\n\n---\n\nPakistani economy is in dumps. Pakistani rupee is in shambles. Their government is living bailout-to-bailout.  Instead of civilian government dealing with USA, somehow army general is dealing with USA? Seems almost unprecedented. And yet absolutely no one within Pakistan or within White House is batting an eye about this unorthodox arrangement. Mind you, there is no ideological alignment either. Pakistan is an Islamic state with scant regard for democracy. It's no secret that Pakistan is economically and militarily dependent on China, heavily. At this stage, it's practically a vassal state of China. It won't be exaggeration to say that whatever Asim Munir is doing in USA has blessings of China (If he doesn't, we'll see how China asserts their heavy hand on Pakistan). China and USA can't see eye-to-eye right now. They are fighting probably the biggest war of superpowers since the cold war ended. \n\nThe rest of the world, including India, Europe, Canada, Australia, is looking at each other on how to deal with bi-polar world in the trade barriers and multiple warfronts and there enters Pakistan, with absolutely no care in the world, happily clicking pictures with the leader of the free world, while being aligned with China. Mind you this is Donald Trump who has said harshest words about Pakistan among all the presidents of USA. In 2018, he said, [\"The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help.

Irrespective of what the reason is, Pakistan always lands in a soft spot. They get their weapons, they get their money from IMF and there's no comeuppance for their actions. What a life!
