The group also sent test packages to the United States and Canada to check those routes.\n\nPoland\u2019s investigation into the alleged plot began in August 2024, based on information gathered by the Internal Security Agency (ABW).\n\nProsecutors established that, between June and August, the suspects sent four parcels containing incendiary devices along with flammable and explosive substances hidden within everyday items, such as massage pillows and cosmetics.\n\nThe items were then sent through courier companies DHL and DPD from Vilnius in Lithuania to addresses in Warsaw, Poland, as well as London and Birmingham in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn July 2024, three of the packages combusted: one at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham Airport, one in a DHL container at Leipzig Airport (where it was on its way to London), and one in a lorry while it was being transported on a Polish road. The fourth package \u201cdid not ignite for technical reasons\u201d, say prosecutors.\n\nThe group also sent two \u201ctest shipments\u201d from Warsaw to the United States and Canada \u201cin order to check logistics channels and the time required for international shipment transportation, particularly by air\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 actions aimed\u00a0to undermine the security and destabilise the logistics and aviation infrastructure of EU countries, the UK, and Poland, as well as to influence social and political attitudes regarding the war in Ukraine,\u201d wrote the Polish prosecutors.\n\nThey also noted that the cost of the damage caused by their actions is estimated at 2.9 million zloty (\u20ac690,000).\n\nOn Friday, Poland\u2019s National Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced that five individuals have been charged over their alleged involvement in the plot. Under Polish privacy law, they can be named only as Vladyslav D., Viacheslav C., Vladyslav B. and Serhii Y. \u2013 all Ukrainian citizens \u2013 and Aleksandr B., a Russian.\n\nAll have been charged with preparing and committing acts of sabotage of a terrorist nature on behalf of foreign intelligence, in this case Russian intelligence. The accused, who have all been placed in pretrial detention, could face life imprisonment if found guilty.\n\nThe evidence gathered by prosecutors has also led them to want to bring charges against a sixth individual, also Russian, named as Yaroslav M, but his location remains unknown. The Polish authorities have initiated domestic and international search efforts while also filing an extradition request to Azerbaijan.\n\nPoland has in recent years been hit by a series of so-called \u201chybrid actions\u201d carried out by\u00a0[operatives working on behalf of Russia]( including sabotage, cyberattacks and disinformation.\n\nIn many cases, the Russian security services have\u00a0[recruited Ukrainians and Belarusians]( often already based in Poland, to carry out those actions.
