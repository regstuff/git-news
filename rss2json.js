They argue that the deal, which is also opposed by the Polish government, would threaten European agriculture and food safety.\n\nDemonstrations were planned in 186 locations around the country. In Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2019s second-largest city, a column of farmers and their supporters marched through the streets. \u201cWe want to live with dignity, and feed you well,\u201d read one placard.\n\nIn some places, tractors were used to block or slow traffic. Around 30 tractors blocked one of two lanes on national road 50 near Warsaw, reported broadcaster TVN.\n\nFarmers argue that the proposed EU-Mercosur deal would open European markets to cheaper food produced to lower standards, thereby undermining local farms already struggling with what they describe as a lack of effective protection.\n\nAlthough Poland is among a minority of EU states that have\u00a0[voiced opposition](\u00a0to the agreement, and Prime Minister Donald Tusk has recently reiterated that position, farmers say they must continue protesting because the Polish government has not done enough to protect their interests.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the protests is not to express opposition \u2018on principle\u2019, but to exert political pressure at the last possible moment,\u201d Agnieszka Beger of Grassroots National Farmers\u2019 Protest (OOPR), the movement coordinating the protests, told financial news service Money.pl.\n\nOOPR says protests are the result of the \u201cpassivity and ineffectiveness of the Polish government regarding the EU-Mercosur agreement\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the Polish government had acted effectively during the negotiations, built a real coalition of countries opposing the agreement, and enforced genuine market protection mechanisms, farmers would not have had to protest today,\u201d the movement said in a\u00a0[Facebook post](\n\n\u201cPlacing the blame solely on the European Union is a simplification that does not reflect the truth,\u201d it added.\n\nHowever, in a statement yesterday, the agriculture minister declared that the government is \u201cfulfilling its promises to Polish farmers\u201d by \u201cleading a diplomatic offensive\u201d in Brussels in order to \u201cbuild a coalition \\[of member states\\] to block the \\[Mercosur\\] agreement\u201d.\n\nThe French and Italian governments have also recently expressed reservations about the Mercosur deal, with both Emmanuel Macron and Giorgia Meloni voicing concern about its impact on local agriculture.\n\nSpeaking amid today\u2019s protests, agriculture minister Stefan Krajewski said that, if it is not possible to build a blocking minority, Poland would propose measures to financially compensate farmers for losses caused by the deal.\n\nBut Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, today declared that \u201cthe Tusk government is deceiving the Polish public by doing nothing to block this agreement\u201d. He said that the farmers \u201care protesting in the interest of us all\u201d.\n\nNegotiations between Brussels and the Mercosur bloc, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay, have been ongoing for decades.\n\nThe currently proposed deal would grant tariff preferences for South American products such as beef, poultry, dairy, sugar and ethanol, while opening Mercosur markets to European industrial goods. There had been talk of signing the agreement this month, but reports now suggest it will happen in January.\n\nIn the meantime, farmers\u00a0from several EU countries, including Poland, Italy and France, protested in Brussels in mid-December.\n\nOn 17 December, the European Council and European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on safeguard measures intended to protect EU agricultural producers if they suffer harm from the Mercosur agreement.\n\nHowever, a vote on whether to approve the measures has been repeatedly postponed, reportedly because they lack enough support among member states, according to news service Euractiv.\n\nRobert Kuryluk, an organic farmer from eastern Poland, told Notes from Poland that, even if the safeguards are introduced, they do not do enough to protect the sector.\n\nHe also accused the EU of hypocrisy, saying that it claims to care for the environment but that the result of the Mercosur deal would be \u201cthousands of hectares of rainforest being cut down\u201d so that food can \u201cbe sold cheaply to wealthy Europe\u201d.\n\nKuryluk said that Brussels is sacrificing European agriculture for the benefit of other industries: \u201cIn exchange for the automotive and agrochemical sectors thriving, European agriculture will be destroyed.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/30/polish-farmers-stage-nationwide-protest-against-eus-planned-mercosur-free-trade-deal/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Korea's birthrate increases for 16th consecutive month in October", "summary": "South Korea's fertility rate stands at 0.83 births per woman.

The island is suffering from combined viruses that include dengue, chikungunya, Oropouche and other respiratory diseases\n\nCuba today is indeed a country of sick citizens who do not know exactly what they are suffering from. All they know is that they are being infected by \u201cthe virus\u201d \u2013 a sinister ghost that has drifted across the entire island, wiping out its inhabitants. First come the high fevers, then red spots develop, or else peeling skin. Vomiting, diarrhea and headaches are inevitable. The hands and knees swell. Victims can barely stand on their feet, and there are those who have not walked again even after the worst is over. A limp indicates a virus survivor. Citizens who drag their legs or complain about achy joints have likely also been hit.\n\nAlmost all families in Cuba have had someone sick at home due to the country\u2019s epidemiological crisis. The disease is in fact a combination of several mosquito-borne viruses, a model of \u201ccombined arboviruses\u201d that includes [dengue, Oropouche and chikungunya]( as well as other respiratory viruses such as H1N influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, [and Covid-19]( According to figures published by the Ministry of Public Health, 5,717 new cases of chikungunya were reported in the last week, bringing the number of patients suffering from it to 38,938. As for dengue, the ministry said the disease remains active in the country\u2019s 14 provinces and 113 municipalities.\n\nAn alarming 33 deaths were reported at the beginning of the week which the government was forced to recognize, including 21 minors \u2013 the demographic most affected by these arboviruses along with the elderly.\n\nNow, with hospitals and morgues overflowing, it is difficult for the ministry to ignore the evidence, though many Cubans maintain that the number of the ill and the dead is far higher than the state is willing to acknowledge. The government has managed to disguise the figures by issuing death certificates that fail to mention arboviruses.\n\nFinally, the Cuban government has been left with no choice but to recognize the \u201cnational epidemiological situation\u201d that has Cubans in a state of panic. The outlook is so critical that some have appealed to the international community not to let their so-called diseased ship sink with its millions of people on board. While state officials downplay the matter, insisting that it is not an outbreak exclusive to Cuba, and that cases are being reported in Brazil and Colombia, the truth is that the general shortages and [state of collapse in Cuba]( have severely undermined the authorities\u2019 ability to control the disease.\n\nThe country suffers a 70% deficit of medication supplies but what worries Cubans most is the lack of proper diagnostic procedures in health institutions that can tell them what type of virus they are suffering from. It was reported that they were discarding the samples a lot of the time because there were no reagents to process them, and the patients were given a negative result.\n\nSeveral Cubans interviewed by EL PA\u00cdS are concerned that the dearth of good food is damaging their chances of recovery. A nutritional guide to which EL PA\u00cdS had access, circulated by the Pedro Kour\u00ed Institute (IPK), reports that, among other things, chikungunya consumes iron reserves, decreases albumin and other proteins, and raises C-reactive protein, all factors that weaken [the immune system]( According to IPK, a prestigious research center for infectious disease, it is vital to eat eggs, yogurt, whey, fish such as salmon, tuna or sardines, vegetables, nuts and certain grains. Most of these products are inaccessible to most Cubans.", "link": "https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-12-14/we-are-dying-cuba-sinks-into-a-health-crisis-amid-medicine-shortages-and-misdiagnosis.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cabinet Office withdraws Andrew papers after 'error'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20k060zy8eo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dmitry Medvedev threatens Volodymyr Zelensky over alleged drone attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/international/5666558-russia-threatens-ukraine-president/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Protests spread across Iran for third day after currency hits record low", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj2llkjv8vo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Blair pressured officials over case of UK soldiers accused of beating Iraqi man to death, files show", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/30/tony-blair-pressured-officials-case-uk-soldiers-iraq-files?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Protests spread across Iran for third day after currency hits record low", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj2llkjv8vo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Coalition of Willing to meet in Ukraine for security talks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/coalition-of-willing-to-meet-in-ukraine-for-security-talks/3785216", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran's government offers dialogue as protests spread to universities", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-government-offers-dialogue-protesters-2025-12-30/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MoU with French Tax Agency Won\u2019t Compromise Nigerian Taxpayers\u2019 Data, Digital Systems, FIRS Clarifies", "summary": ".", "link": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/2025/12/15/mou-with-french-tax-agency-wont-compromise-nigerian-taxpayers-data-digital-systems-firs-clarifies/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Daily Watch \u2013 West African crude struggles for buyers, Ghana tightens Central Bank financing rules", "summary": "President Bola Tinubu on Thursday expressed confidence that Nigeria would adopt state police, saying decentralised policing is key to improving security nationwide. Speaking to governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the party\u2019s national caucus meeting in Abuja, Tinubu said he had discussed the proposal with US and European leaders as part of Nigeria\u2019s security reforms. \u201cI told them that definitely we will pass a state police to improve security,\u201d he said, adding that he was confident the APC had the political strength to deliver the reform. The creation of state police would require a constitutional amendment and has long been debated amid concerns over funding, political abuse and oversight. Tinubu also reiterated his commitment to enforcing the Supreme Court ruling on local government autonomy, urging governors to ensure councils receive funds directly from the federation account, stressing that autonomy without direct funding was meaningless.\n\nWest African crude oil sellers are struggling to place December- and January-loading cargoes as cheaper and more abundant alternatives crowd the market, traders and analysts told Reuters. Around 20 million barrels of Nigerian crude and up to six Angolan cargoes for December and January remained unsold this week, reflecting a broader global supply surplus that has weighed on prices. Brent crude fell below $60 a barrel, its lowest level since May. Analysts say softer seasonal demand, high freight costs and shifting buying patterns are slowing trade. Middle Eastern supplies, helped by lower official selling prices and shorter shipping routes, are displacing West African grades in Asia, while Russia continues to dominate India\u2019s imports. China has also turned to cheaper or closer alternatives, leaving January trade in Angola well behind average levels. In Nigeria, reduced purchases by the Dangote refinery ahead of January maintenance have added to the overhang.\n\nGhana\u2019s parliament on Thursday approved amendments to the Bank of Ghana Act aimed at tightening limits on central bank financing of the government and strengthening the bank\u2019s independence. The Bank of Ghana (Amendment) Bill, 2025 bars the central bank from purchasing government securities on the primary market and narrows the definition of emergencies that previously allowed lending beyond a 5% cap of the prior year\u2019s revenues. Emergencies are now limited to force majeure events such as natural disasters, public health crises or presidentially declared emergencies. The reforms follow criticism of extensive central bank support during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, when Ghana lost access to international markets, inflation surged, and the Bank of Ghana recorded negative equity. The law also tightens board eligibility rules, enhances audit oversight and aligns with Ghana\u2019s 2023 IMF programme to curb inflation and restore investor confidence.\n\nCocoa prices rose for a second consecutive session in New York on Wednesday as traders reassessed expectations of a market oversupply and tightening procurement conditions. Cocoa futures climbed 1.5% to $6,066 per metric ton, extending a rebound after losses earlier in the week. Sentiment has improved after Citigroup cut its forecast for a global cocoa surplus this season by 41% to 79,000 tons, signalling a tighter balance than previously expected. While cocoa deliveries to export ports from top producer Ivory Coast, remain strong, exchange-monitored inventories in the United States continue to fall. They are now at their lowest level since March, providing further price support. Prices could gain additional momentum from cocoa\u2019s inclusion in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which Citigroup estimates could attract about $2 billion in inflows in early January. Robusta coffee slipped 1.5%, while raw sugar edged slightly lower.\n\nZambia\u2019s President Hakainde Hichilema on Thursday signed into law constitutional amendments expanding parliament, a move critics say could advantage the ruling party ahead of elections due in August 2026. The changes raise the number of members of parliament to about 280 from 167 by creating new constituencies, introducing 40 reserved seats for women, youth and people with disabilities, and increasing presidential appointees to 11 from eight. Critics, including the Catholic Church and opposition figures, argue the reforms were rushed through parliament and could tilt the electoral field in favour of Hichilema\u2019s party. Civil rights activist Brebner Changala said the delimitation process could be used to entrench the ruling party\u2019s strongholds. Hichilema, who is seeking a second term, rejected the criticism, saying the reforms were made in good faith after consultations and were needed because some constituencies were too large for effective service delivery.", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2025/12/daily-watch-west-african-crude-struggles-for-buyers-ghana-tightens-central-bank-financing-rules/#gsc.tab=0", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
