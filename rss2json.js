For non astro nerds, that makes it about as bright as the full moon, all concentrated into a single point. It would have been easily visible in daytime and would have lit up the night sky for weeks. Interestingly, my googling has yielded no results as to how this may have been seen from earth (hence my own rough estimation of its apparent brightness, I haven't even seen guesstimates out there). While 10 thousand years ago is a long time (it exploded 11k years ago but is about 1k light years away), humanity was very much a thing back then. Writing only goes back 5k years, what's called proto-writing about 9k, just a thousand short of hitting the mark. But cave paintings have been around for 40k years. I'm certainly not an expert on all things anthropology, my own training is in cosmology, but I'm surprised at the complete lack of discussion or even theorizing around this point. It would have been a truly spectacular event with massive and generalized cultural impact. If you had gods then you definitely started thinking up more stories about them and how they blew up the sky one afternoon.\n\nSure, more northern observers missed the show. But it's not exactly on the ecliptic so at least some people saw it both night and day, more and more guaranteed for the more southernly observers. But past that I feel like I'd be widly speculating in trying to figure out more about what impact it must have had on humanity, however minor. I suppose I'm more curious about finding resources from actual archaeoastronomical researchers about this, but there seems to be little if not 0 interest in this, even though it was the first thing that hit me when I looked at the properties of the Vela supernova remnant. So I'm very open to actual research on this if any of you have seen it, or to hear the musings of actual archaeologists on the topic.\n\nI was half hoping that a quick google search would reveal that there was an explosion of drawings of an ultra bright star around 10k years ago, but alas I've found absolutely nothing on this.
