Denial of Nazi crimes is an offence in Poland that carries a jail sentence of up to three years.\n\nBraun, who\u00a0[finished fourth in the recent presidential elections](\u00a0with 6.3% of the vote, made his remarks during an interview today with radio station WNET. The veteran far-right politician, who is a member of the European Parliament, has a long history of hateful and conspiratorial rhetoric regarding Jews and other minorities.\n\n\n\nDuring the interview, Braun referred to what he claimed are the \u201clies of the Talmud, the Haggadah \\[two Jewish religious texts\\], and the Holocaust\u201d. He said that Jewish organisations \u201ccondemn those who tell the truth that ritual murder is a fact and Auschwitz with its gas chambers is a lie\u201d.\n\nA\u00a0[longstanding antisemitic canard](\u00a0is that Jews murder Christians, in particular children, and use their blood for religious rituals. Meanwhile, many modern antisemites deny the fact that gas chambers were used at Auschwitz and other German-Nazi camps to murder Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nAfter the interviewer contested Braun\u2019s remarks, he reiterated them, saying that the Auschwitz Museum provides a \u201cpseudo-historical account\u201d about what happened at the camp and blocks research into the gas chambers. He also cited a book by an Israeli historian that he says proves Jews carried out ritual murder.\n\nThat led the interviewer to immediately cut short the broadcast, saying that there \u201care limits to political cynicism and sensationalism when it comes to several million victims and their memory\u201d.\n\n\n\nSubsequently, Anna-Maria \u017bukowska, head of the parliamentary caucus of The Left (Lewica), one of the groups that make up Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, announced that she was filing a complaint to prosecutors regarding Braun\u2019s remarks.\n\nShe accused him of violating article 55 of Poland\u2019s law on the Institute of National Remembrance, which criminalises public denial of Nazi and communist crimes. Those found guilty can be punished by up to three years in prison.\n\nLate on Thursday afternoon, the district prosecutor\u2019s office in Warsaw announced that it had initiated an investigation into whether Braun had committed the offence of denying Nazi crimes.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Piotr Cywi\u0144ski, the director of the Auschwitz Museum, which is a Polish state institution, issued a statement condemning Braun\u2019s \u201cscandalous\u201d comments, which he said were not only a violation of the law but also \u201can insult to the memory of the victims of the camp\u201d.\n\n\u201cGrzegorz Braun\u2019s words are not a \u2018political provocation\u2019, but a conscious lie and an act of ideological, antisemitic hatred,\u201d said Cywi\u0144ski. \u201cThey cannot remain without a decisive response from the state and all decent people \u2013 for whom the memory of Auschwitz is of particular importance.\u201d\n\nThe museum director noted that, while it was primarily Jews who were victims of the gas chambers of Auschwitz, ethnic Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, and Roma were also murdered in them.\n\nAt least 1.3 million prisoners were transported to Auschwitz during the war, with at least 1.1 million of them killed at the camp. Around one million of those victims were Jews, most of whom were murdered in gas chambers immediately after their arrival. The second largest group of victims were ethnic Poles.\n\n\n\nCywi\u0144ski said that the museum would itself file a notification to prosecutors regarding Braun\u2019s remarks. He also appealed to Polish media to stop giving space to Braun, who \u201chas repeatedly shown that he cannot function in the public space without vandalism, lies, hate speech and racism\u201d.\n\nLast week, Braun was\u00a0[presented by prosecutors with seven sets of charges](\u00a0relating to four incidents, including his attack on a Jewish religious celebration in parliament two years ago.\n\nHe is also being investigated over a series of incidents during the recent presidential election campaign, including when he\u00a0[vandalised an LGBT+ exhibition]( made\u00a0[antisemitic remarks](\u00a0during a televised debate, and\u00a0[removed a Ukrainian flag](\u00a0from a public building.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/07/10/polish-far-right-leader-declares-auschwitz-gas-chambers-to-be-fake/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU risks breaking international law over Israel gas deal, say campaigners | Europe accused of \u2018trampling over Palestinian rights\u2019 with deal linked to imports from pipeline running parallel to Gaza coast", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/12/eu-risks-breaking-international-law-over-israel-gas-deal-say-campaigners", "author": "None"}, {"title": "can putting prompt injection in your resume be effective? dumb? risky?", "summary": "I have a job and I'm not planning to leave it right now, but I've been really curious to test something.

The Greeks called the island Pithecusae and harnessed the healing powers of its volcanic thermal springs to found its first spas.\n\nToday, with its lush beauty, laid-back vibe and revered thermal spa culture, Ischia is Italy's quintessential wellness retreat \u2013 despite sitting atop the Campi Flegrei supervolcano. But it's precisely that volatile volcanic geology that has shaped the island's verdant landscapes and wild beaches.\n\nWhen the Romans seized Pithecusae sometime around 322BC, they renamed the island Aenaria \u2013 a name that appears in ancient texts from Pliny the Elder to Strabo, often in relation to military events. But unlike the Greeks, who left behind a necropolis, kilns and troves of pottery, the Romans left only a few modest tombs, engravings and scattered opus reticulatum. Scholars settled on the theory that they'd come to the island but never properly settled it \u2013 perhaps avoiding it due to its constant volcanic rumblings.\n\n\nThen, in 2011, passionate local sailors reopened the excavation, this time digging into the sea floor. Soon, they were able to confirm that 2m beneath the bay's volcanic seabed lay the ruins of a massive Roman-era quay. Further digs found coins, amphorae, mosaics, seaside villas and the wooden wreckage of a ship.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of the quay's wooden stakes puts it at roughly 75 to AD30. The discovery of the shipwreck in 2020 unearthed naval equipment, like a bronze mooring post in the shape of a swan's head \u2013 typical of Roman military vessels \u2013 as well as items like lead sling bullets, suggesting that Aenaria may have been a crucial military outpost controlling the Gulf of Naples. Recovered amphorae also suggest Aenaria's wide reach; the 142 clay variants come from 12 Mediterranean production zones, stretching from Campania to the Levant. The most recent analyses showed that the site's lead came from Spain, painting an even clearer picture of how deep Aenaria's intercultural network was.   \n\n\"What we've found is 99% underwater. It's like Pompeii: until it was excavated in the 1700s, no one knew it was there. But that doesn't mean it wasn't important or didn't exist.\"", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250710-italys-sunken-city-returning-from-the-sea", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Commentary: BRICS is sliding towards irrelevance - CNA", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/brics-summit-rio-brazil-russia-india-china-trump-tariff-5228781", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US, India in Talks on Trade Deal That May Cut Tariff Below 20% - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-11/us-india-in-talks-on-trade-deal-that-may-cut-tariff-below-20", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Medieval King Who Died From a Toilet", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/hive-133974/@melancholic.bear/the-medieval-king-who-died-from-a-toilet", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tracking hallucinations with System theory.
