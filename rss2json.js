If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison.\n\nAndruszkiewicz denies the accusations, calling them a \u201ctrumped-up fairy tale\u201d and \u201cact of political revenge\u201d by the government against the office of Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nOn Wednesday, prosecutors announced that they have brought charges against Andruszkiewicz in a case that dates back to 2014, when he was the leader of All-Polish Youth (M\u0142odzie\u017c Wszechpolska), a prominent far-right group, in the Podlaskie province.\n\nThe accusations relate to claims that signatures of support for the nomination of local election candidates standing on behalf of the National Movement (Ruch Narodowy), another nationalist group aligned with All-Polish Youth, in Podlaskie were forged.\n\nNow, eleven and a half years after the investigation began, prosecutors have concluded that Andruszkiewicz was responsible for \u201cdirecting the forgery by other persons of documents\u201d.\n\nThey say one of the witnesses in the case gave testimony to this fact, which was then corroborated by other evidence, including further witness statements and handwriting analysis.\n\nIf found guilty of forgery, Andruszkiewicz would be imprisoned for up to five years. He also faces charges of violating the electoral process, punishable by up to three years in prison, and unlawfully processing personal data, which carries a potential two-year jail term.\n\nProsecutors say that, when he was summoned today to hear the charges, Andruszkiewicz did not plead guilty. The politician himself also took to social media to proclaim his innocence and suggest that the prosecution against him is politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThis charge is a completely trumped-up fairy tale used as a political weapon,\u201d he wrote, promising to \u201cdebunk this false narrative\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, last week, after prosecutors had summoned him to appear today, Andruszkiewicz called their actions \u201can obvious act of political revenge\u201d and part of \u201ca broader plan of constant attacks by the current ruling party on the chancellery of the president\u201d.\n\nSince Nawrocki came to power last year, he has regularly clashed with the more liberal government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nThe president himself has not yet commented on today\u2019s announcement. But he did come to the defence of his deputy chief of staff last week, after Andruszkiewicz had been summoned by prosecutors.\n\n\u201cTwelve years of investigation without evidence; clear and unanimous opinions from handwriting experts pointing to no connection of Adam Andruszkiewicz to the case \u2013 and suddenly, a revelation,\u201d wrote the president sarcastically on social media.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office acts slowly and selectively in this matter, but strangely enough, always in line with the expectations of the \u2018boss\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s mention of the \u201cboss\u201d is likely to be a reference either to Waldemar \u017burek, the justice minister and prosecutor general, or Tusk.\n\nSince coming to power in December 2023, Tusk\u2019s government has made holding to account figures associated with the former ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party one of its priorities. However, PiS accuses the authorities of weaponising the legal system against them for political reasons.\n\nAfter leaving All-Polish Youth, Andruszkiewicz was associated with a handful of other small right-wing parties before joining PiS in 2019 and becoming a deputy minister in the then PiS-led government.\n\nLast year, he was a senior figure in the presidential election campaign of Nawrocki, whose candidacy was supported by PiS. When Nawrocki became president in August, he appointed Andruszkiewicz as his deputy chief of staff.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/11/presidents-deputy-chief-of-staff-charged-in-signature-forgery-case/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ethiopia builds secret camp to train Sudan RSF fighters, sources say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/investigations/ethiopia-builds-secret-camp-train-sudan-rsf-fighters-sources-say-2026-02-10/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland begins process of selecting new members of judicial body at heart of rule-of-law dispute", "summary": "The speaker of parliament has launched the process of selecting new members of a key judicial body, despite the fact that it will take place under rules introduced by the former government that the current authorities regard as illegitimate.\n\nThe institution in question, the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), is responsible for nominating judges to courts. It has been at the heart of\u00a0[Poland\u2019s rule-of-law dispute](\u00a0after the former Law and Justice (PiS) government in 2017 changed the manner in which the KRS\u2019s members are appointed.\n\nPreviously, most were chosen by judges themselves. However, after PiS\u2019s reforms, most were selected by politicians. The move was widely condemned by expert bodies as undermining judicial independence. Polish\u00a0and\u00a0European court rulings have found the KRS to no longer be a legitimate body.\n\nThe government that replaced PiS in 2023 has\u00a0[proposed legislation](\u00a0to transfer the power to elect most KRS members back to the judiciary. The bill was approved by parliament in January but has yet to be signed by President Karol Nawrocki, a PiS ally.\n\nGiven that the four-year terms of current KRS members will expire on 12 May, Wednesday this week was the final day permitted by law for parliament to launch the procedure for choosing their replacements, which must start at least 90 days in advance.\n\nJustice minister Waldemar \u017burek and W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, had expressed hope that Nawrocki would sign the law before that deadline.\n\nHowever, as he had not done so by Wednesday, Czarzasty said that he had no choice but to launch the process of choosing new KRS members because, although the current rules are flawed, they remain binding.\n\n\u201cI asked the president to\u2026sign the bill on the KRS, which he has in his possession. He did not sign it. Therefore, the president takes full responsibility for the fact that I had to initiate the procedure according to the old, bad law,\u201d said Czarzasty, quoted by the Onet news website.\n\nHe noted that the law currently in force \u201ctakes away judges\u2019 independence\u201d and \u201chas led to the legal system being very unstable\u201d. Because thousands of judicial appointments have been made by the reformed KRS since 2017, there are legal doubts about the status of those judges and the legitimacy of their rulings.\n\nIn\u00a0[one recent case]( a court annulled a divorce because it had been granted by a judge appointed through the disputed process.\u00a0\n\nEarlier this week, however, Czarzasty said that, if the president ends up signing the bill, any steps taken under the current rules to elect new members would have no legal effect. Nawrocki has until 19 February to make a decision.\n\n\u017burek announced earlier this week that the government has a \u201cplan B\u201d if the president vetoes the bill, which he said officials at the presidencial palace had indicated was likely.\n\nThe plan would involve parliament, where the government has a majority, simply approving KRS members democratically chosen by judges themselves. That would in effect restore the situation that existed before PiS\u2019s 2017 reform, though without actually changing the law.\n\n\u201cLet the democratic majority respect the choice of the judicial community, so that this process is in line with the constitution and serves citizens as well as the stability of judicial rulings,\u201d said \u017burek on social media.\n\nIn 2019, Poland\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0that, due to PiS\u2019s reforms, \u201cthe KRS is not an impartial and independent body\u201d as it had been rendered \u201cdependent on the executive authorities\u201d. In 2022, the same\u00a0[court](\u00a0found the KRS to no longer be consistent with its role outlined in the constitution.\n\nIn 2021, the European Court of Human Rights likewise\u00a0[found](\u00a0the overhauled KRS was no longer independent from legislative or executive powers. The same year, Poland became the\u00a0[first country to ever be expelled](\u00a0from the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary.\n\nHowever, even some proponents of reversing PiS\u2019s reforms have argued that it would be impractical and unfair to simply cancel all appointments made through the KRS since 2017, leading the ruling coalition to put forward bills that included measures to resolve the status of illegitimately appointed judges.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/12/poland-begins-process-of-selecting-new-members-of-judicial-body-at-heart-of-rule-of-law-dispute/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
