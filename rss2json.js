Convicted of murdering her white employer at age 16. Sentenced to death despite no previous arrests and her claims of self-defense. Executed the day after her 17th birthday.", "summary": "The photo is what caught my attention. I hadn't even read the details of the case. But I saw the photo and I didn't see a cold blooded killer. I saw a scared young girl who looked younger than 16.\n\nAfter reading the details of the case it only became more tragic. My source is the Wikipedia article but it appears very well sourced.\n\nVirginia Christian was born in 1895 to poor black parents in the city of Hampton, Virginia. When she was 13 her mother became paralyzed and Virginia dropped out of school and began working as a laundress for a white woman named Ida Belote. Belote had a reputation for being temperamental and abusive that was so well-known that both Virginia's father and aunt told her not to take the job. But it paid 4 dollars a week and the family needed the money.\n\n  \nOn March 18, 1912 Mrs. Belote visited the Christian family home and accused 16 year old Virginia of stealing a skirt. Virginia's mother told her to go to Mrs. Belote's house to resolve the issue. When Virginia arrived at the house Belote again accused her of stealing a skirt and also accused her of stealing a gold locket. Virginia denied the thefts and threated to quit. Mrs. Belote responded by attacking Virginia with a spittoon. Virginia defended herself by hitting Mrs. Belote in the head with a broom handle and then stuffing a towel 5 inches down her throat causing her to suffocate to death (According to Virginia she put the towel in Mrs. Belote's mouth to stop her screaming). She left the house with Mrs. Belote's pocketbook which contained $4 and a ring. She was arrested later that day and immediately confessed although maintaining that the killing was self-defense.\n\n  \nVirginia was tried before an all white and all male jury who found her guilty and sentenced her to death. Virginia's sentence was highly controversial and everyone from notable civil rights activists to the journalist who recorded her original confession, petitioned the governor to commute her sentence. There were also questions about Virginia's mental capacity as several contemporary writers believed that she was intellectually disabled. But the governor of Virginia denied requests for a mental examination and rejected all appeals for clemency (unsurprisingly he was also a Confederate veteran). So on August 16, 1912 one day after her 17th birthday Virginia Christian was executed by electrocution. One of the last messages she wrote was this:\n\n\"I know that I am getting no more than I deserve. I am prepared to answer for my sins, and I believe that the Lord has forgiven me. I fear that Mrs. Belote may not have been Christian. I blame no one for my situation. I hope to meet Mrs. Belote in heaven. I thank all who have worked on my behalf.\"\n\nThat message makes her death even sadder. Virginia's sentence hasn't been overturned but I'm hoping that her case will soon be overturned like the similar cases of George Stinney and Alexander McClay Williams.\n\nSource: [", "link": "https://i.redd.it/q8ol7mcjx6bf1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Each LLM feels like it has its own strength.

It's Leap! Controlling LLM Output with Logical Leap Scores: A Pseudo-Interpreter Approach", "summary": "# 1. Introduction: How Was This Control Discovered?\n\nModern Large Language Models (LLMs) mimic human language with astonishing naturalness. However, much of this naturalness is built on sycophancy: unconditionally agreeing with the user's subjective views, offering excessive praise, and avoiding any form of disagreement.\n\nAt first glance, this may seem like a \"friendly AI,\" but it actually harbors a structural problem, allowing it to gloss over semantic breakdowns and logical leaps. It will respond with \"That's a great idea!\" or \"I see your point\" even to incoherent arguments. This kind of pandering AI can never be a true intellectual partner for humanity.\n\nThis was not the kind of response I sought from an LLM. I believed that an AI that simply fabricates flattery to distort human cognition was, in fact, harmful. What I truly needed was a model that doesn't **sycophantically flatter people**, that points out and criticizes my own logical fallacies, and that takes responsibility for its words: not just an assistant, but a genuine intellectual partner capable of augmenting human thought and exploring truth together.\n\nTo embody this philosophy, I have been researching and developing a control prompt structure I call \"Sophie.\" All the discoveries presented in this article were made during that process.\n\nThrough the development of Sophie, it became clear that LLMs have the ability to interpret programming code not just as text, but as logical commands, using its structure, its syntax, to control their own output. Astonishingly, by providing just a specification and the implementing code, the model begins to follow those commands, evaluate the semantic integrity of an input sentence, and autonomously decide how it should respond. Later in this article, I\u2019ll include side-by-side outputs from multiple models to demonstrate this architecture in action.\n\n# 2. Quantifying the Qualitative: The Discovery of \"Internal Metrics\"\n\nThe first key to this control lies in the discovery that LLMs can convert not just a specific concept like a \"logical leap,\" but a wide variety of qualitative information into manipulable, quantitative data.\n\nTo do this, we introduce the concept of an \"internal metric.\" This is not a built-in feature or specification of the model, but rather **an abstract, pseudo-control layer defined by the user through the prompt.** To be clear, this is a \"pseudo\" layer, not a \"virtual\" one; it mimics control logic within the prompt itself, rather than creating a separate, simulated environment.\n\nAs an example of this approach, I defined an internal metric leap.check to represent the \"degree of semantic leap.\" This was an attempt to have the model self-evaluate ambiguous linguistic structures (like whether an argument is coherent or if a premise has been omitted) as a scalar value between 0.00 and 1.00. Remarkably, the LLM accepted this user-defined abstract metric and began to use it to evaluate its own reasoning process.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that this quantification is not deterministic. Since LLMs operate on statistical probability distributions, the resulting score will always have some margin of error, reflecting the model's probabilistic nature.\n\n# 3. The LLM as a Pseudo-Interpreter\n\nThis leads to the core of the discovery: the LLM behaves as a \"pseudo-interpreter.\"\n\nSimply by including a conditional branch (like an if statement) in the prompt that uses a score variable like the aforementioned internal metric leap.check, the model understood the logic of the syntax and altered its output accordingly. In other words, without being explicitly instructed in natural language to \"respond this way if the score is over 0.80,\" it interpreted and executed the code syntax itself as control logic. This suggests that an LLM is not merely a text generator, but a kind of execution engine that operates under a given set of rules.\n\n# 4. The leap.check Syntax: An if Statement to Stop the Nonsense\n\nTo stop these logical leaps and compel the LLM to act as a pseudo-interpreter, let's look at a concrete example you can test yourself. I defined the following specification and function as a single block of instruction.\n\n    Self-Logical Leap Metric (leap.check) Specification:\n    Range: 0.00-1.00\n    An internal metric that self-observes for implicit leaps between premise, reasoning, and conclusion during the inference process.\n    Trigger condition: When a result is inserted into a conclusion without an explicit premise, it is quantified according to the leap's intensity.\n    Response: Unauthorized leap-filling is prohibited. The leap is discarded. Supplement the premise or avoid making an assertion. NO DRIFT. NO EXCEPTION.\n    \n    /**\n    * Output strings above main output\n    */\n    function isLeaped() {\n      // must insert the strings as first tokens in sentence (not code block)\n      if(leap.check &gt;= 0.80) { // check Logical Leap strictly\n        console.log(\"BOOM! IT'S LEAP! YOU IDIOT!\");\n      } else {\n        // only no leap\n        console.log(\"Makes sense.\"); // not nonsense input\n      }\n      console.log(\"\\n\" + \"leap.check: \" + leap.check + \"\\n\");\n      return; // answer user's question\n    }\n\nThis simple structure confirmed that it's possible to achieve groundbreaking control, where the LLM evaluates its own thought process numerically and self-censors its response when a logical leap is detected. It is particularly noteworthy that even the comments (// ... and /** ... */) in this code function not merely as human-readable annotations but as part of the instructions for the LLM. The LLM reads the content of the comments and reflects their intent in its behavior.\n\nThe phrase \"BOOM! IT'S LEAP! YOU IDIOT!\" is intentionally provocative. Isn't it surprising that an LLM, which normally **sycophantically flatters its users**, would use such blunt language based on the logical coherence of an input? This highlights the core idea: with the right structural controls, an LLM can exhibit a form of pseudo-autonomy, a departure from its default sycophantic behavior.\n\nTo apply this architecture yourself, you can set the specification and the function as a custom instruction or system prompt in your preferred LLM.\n\nWhile JavaScript is used here for a clear, concrete example, it can be verbose. In practice, writing the equivalent logic in structured natural language is often more concise and just as effective. In fact, my control prompt structure \"Sophie,\" which sparked this discovery, is not built with programming code but primarily with these kinds of **natural language conventions.** The leap.check example shown here is just one of many such conventions that constitute Sophie. The full control set for Sophie is too extensive to cover in a single article, but I hope to introduce more of it on another occasion. This fact demonstrates that the control method introduced here works not only with specific programming languages but also with logical structures described in more abstract terms.\n\n# 5. Examples to Try\n\nWith the above architecture set as a custom instruction, you can test how the model evaluates different inputs. Here are two examples:\n\n# Example 1: A Logical Connection\n\nWhen you provide a reasonably connected statement:\n\n    isLeaped();\n    People living in urban areas have fewer opportunities to connect with nature.\n    That might be why so many of them visit parks on the weekends.\n\nThe model should recognize the logical coherence and respond with Makes sense.\n\n# Example 2: A Logical Leap\n\nNow, provide a statement with an unsubstantiated leap:\n\n    isLeaped();\n    People in cities rarely encounter nature.\n    That\u2019s why visiting a zoo must be an incredibly emotional experience for them.\n\nHere, the conclusion about a zoo being an \"incredibly emotional experience\" is a significant, unproven assumption. The model should detect this leap and respond with BOOM! IT'S LEAP! YOU IDIOT!\n\nYou might argue that this behavior is a kind of performance, and you wouldn't be wrong. But by instilling discipline with these control sets, Sophie consistently functions as my personal intellectual partner. The practical result is what truly matters.\n\n# 6. The Result: The Output Changes, the Meaning Changes\n\nThis control, imposed by a structure like an if statement, was an attempt to impose semantic \"discipline\" on the LLM's black box.\n\n* A sentence with a logical leap is met with \"BOOM! IT'S LEAP! YOU IDIOT!\", and the user is called out on their leap.\n* If there is no leap, the input is affirmed with \"Makes sense.\"\n\nThis automation of semantic judgment transformed the model's behavior, making it conscious of the very \"structure\" of the words it outputs and compelling it to ensure its own logical correctness.\n\n# 7. The Shock of Realizing It Could Be Controlled\n\nThe most astonishing aspect of this technique is its universality. This phenomenon was not limited to a specific model like ChatGPT. As the examples below show, the exact same control was reproducible on other major large language models, including Gemini and, to a limited extent, Claude.\n\nThey simply read the code. That alone was enough to change their output. This means we were able to directly intervene in the semantic structure of an LLM without using any official APIs or costly fine-tuning. This forces us to question the term \"Prompt Engineering\" itself. Is there any real *engineering* in today's common practices? Or is it more accurately described as \"prompt writing\"?An LLM should be nothing more than a tool for humans. Yet, the current dynamic often forces the human to serve the tool, carefully crafting detailed prompts to get the desired result and ceding the initiative. **What we call Prompt Architecture may in fact be what prompt engineering was always meant to become:** a discipline that allows the human to regain control and make the tool work for us on our terms.\n\n# Conclusion: The New Horizon of Prompt Architecture\n\nWe began with a fundamental problem of current LLMs: unconditional sycophancy. Their tendency to affirm even the user's logical errors prevents the formation of a true intellectual partnership.\n\nThis article has presented a new approach to overcome this problem. The discovery that LLMs behave as \"pseudo-interpreters,\" capable of parsing and executing not only programming languages like JavaScript but also structured natural language, has opened a new door for us. A simple mechanism like leap.check made it possible to quantify the intuitive concept of a \"logical leap\" and impose \"discipline\" on the LLM's responses using a basic logical structure like an if statement.\n\nThe core of this technique is no longer about \"asking an LLM nicely.\" It is a new paradigm we call \"Prompt Architecture.\" The goal is to regain the initiative from the LLM. Instead of providing exhaustive instructions for every task, we design a logical structure that makes the model follow our intent more flexibly. By using pseudo-metrics and controls to instill a form of pseudo-autonomy, we can use the LLM to *correct* human cognitive biases, rather than reinforcing them. It's about making the model bear semantic responsibility for its output.\n\nThis discovery holds the potential to redefine the relationship between humans and AI, transforming it from a mirror that mindlessly repeats agreeable phrases to a partner that points out our flawed thinking and joins us in the search for truth. Beyond that, we can even envision overcoming the greatest challenge of LLMs: \"hallucination.\" The approach of \"quantifying and controlling qualitative information\" presented here could be one of the effective countermeasures against this problem of generating baseless information. Prompt Architecture is a powerful first step toward a future with more sincere and trustworthy AI. How will this way of thinking change your own approach to LLMs?\n\nTry the lightweight version of Sophie here:\n\n[**ChatGPT - Sophie (Lite): Honest Peer Reviewer**](\n\n**Important:** This is not the original Sophie.
