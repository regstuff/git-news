You can _optionally_ say \"Chain-of-Thought Pre-Analysis For Everything First\" then say \"Memory Map For Everything First\" so that you can guarantee your accuracy is high as possible before condensation begins. This is optional though :)\n   \n3. **Begin Condensation**: breaks your doc into chunks (3k words max each), you can preferably change that amount before condensation begins. But this helps make sure accuracy is high.\n   \n4. **Optional Review**: After it condenses you can take your original text and compare it by your condensed version with the following: \"Compare original text with condensed text by Identifying anything important that was left out. Do I really need this? , Show me mechanical fidelity percentage, Use multiple messages if necessary.\"\n\n5. **Optional Supplement**: You can bolt on extra info, matching the format of your condensed notes with the following: \"Draft a _\"micro-supplement\"_ I could easily bolt onto condensed notes that would restore these.
