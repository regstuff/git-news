I was planning to conduct continued pretraining on TFBertForMaskedLM, and then extracting the Bert layer, or its weights, and attaching a classification head. For MosaicBERT, I don't know how to create a Tensorflow object representing tits architecture, I only have a transformers.BertForMaskedLM object.\n\n- Does anyone know how I can create the TensorFlow equivalent?\n\n- Alternatively, how can I change the head for the maskedLM and use is as a classifier for fine tuning?\n\nI tried initialising the MosaicBert model as a TFBertModel class to add the MLM head myself, using the from\\_pt (from Pytorch) option, but this warned of weights which were not loaded, corresponding to a mismatch in their architectures.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1e66whi/loading_mosaicbert_as_a_tensoflow_model/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ex-CIA analyst charged with spying for South Korea", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqv5qd82pjlo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany slashes Ukraine funding in savings push", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-war-slashes-funds-ukraine-russia-savings-aid-drat-2025-budget-defense-deal/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": []}}};
