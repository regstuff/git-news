The first report, on how public media were used by PiS to \u201crepress and defame\u201d civil society groups and activists, was\u00a0[published in September](\n\nThe other three reports, which are yet to be published, relate to \u201clegal harassment\u201d of activists, \u201cpolice actions against protesters\u201d, and \u201cthe actions of agencies other than the police, including citizen surveillance\u201d.\n\nOne of the members of the commission is Klementyna Suchanow, who is a founder and leader of\u00a0[All-Poland Women\u2019s Strike](\u00a0(Og\u00f3lnopolski Strajk Kobiet), which led\u00a0[mass protests](\u00a0against the tightening of Poland\u2019s abortion law. They were the largest demonstrations in Poland\u2019s post-communist history.\u00a0\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, journalist Grzegorz Rzeczkowski revealed that Suchanow had been denied security clearance \u201cdue to the Internal Security Agency\u2019s (ABW) concerns\u201d about her. That means that she \u201ccannot continue her work\u201d on the commission, he added.\n\nRados\u0142aw Gruca, the journalist presenting the programme on which Rzeczkowski was appearing, said that, \u201cas a result, no one will investigate the surveillance of Women\u2019s Strike, and in my opinion that\u2019s what they were afraid of\u201d.\n\nSuchanow, who was appearing on the same show, confirmed that she was seeking to appeal the decision. In a subsequent social media post, she appealed to Tusk to take action over the issue.\n\nThe activist said that she had been denied security clearance due to an incident during the abortion protests when she had thrown paint towards police outside the constitutional court, for which she was charged with assaulting an officer.\n\nThe spokesman for Poland\u2019s security services, Jacek Dobrzy\u0144ski, however, defended the ABW\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe reasons for denying access to classified information are absolutely formal and known to the interested party,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe ABW has no possibility in such a situation to issue a \\[security clearance\\] certificate to anyone.\u201d\n\nHe also added that the decision regarding Suchanow creates \u201cno obstacles to investigating the surveillance of Women\u2019s Strike \u2013 this commission was established, among other things, for that purpose\u201d.\n\nPiS spokesman Rafa\u0142 Bochenek told conservative broadcaster Republika that the very fact someone like Suchanow was appointed by Tusk to the commission is concerning.\n\n\u201cI have the impression that we are governed by very shady people who have repeatedly disturbed public order and have displayed various acts of aggression in public space towards officers,\u201d said Bochenek.\n\n\u201cThe current government allows these individuals to function in public life. This type of behaviour is rewarded\u2026These people have a huge influence on those in power today,\u201d he added, calling them \u201cTusk\u2019s soldiers\n\nWhen PiS was in power, it regularly criticised the leaders of Women\u2019s Strike,\u00a0[accusing them](\u00a0of engaging in and encouraging illegal behaviour and threatening public health during the pandemic. Last year, Suchanow and two other leaders were\u00a0[acquitted](\u00a0of \u201ccreating an epidemiological threat\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, Republika published the content of text messages it claimed show Suchanow offering help to activists \u201csmuggling immigrants\u201d\u00a0[over the border with Belarus]( Suchanow denied being involved in any such activities", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/26/polish-abortion-activist-denied-security-clearance-to-investigate-surveillance-of-her-own-movement/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hong Kong fire live: At least 36 dead, nearly 300 missing in Tai Po as blaze engulfs apartment buildings", "summary": "* Fire engulfs residential towers in [northern Hong Kong](\n* 36 people have died, 29 are hospitalized and 279 are missing\n* Firefighters have been battling blaze for hours\n* Some residents still trapped in buildings\n* The complex includes 2,000 apartments and houses over 4,600 people", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-fire-live-four-killed-blaze-engulfs-apartment-building-tai-po-2025-11-26/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK to scrap jury trials except for serious crimes", "summary": "", "link": "https://parliamentnews.co.uk/justice-secretary-wants-jury-trials-scrapped-except-in-most-serious-cases", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ambitious plan to store CO2 beneath the North Sea set to start operations", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/carbon-capture-storage-climate-denmark-north-sea-060306c826ba527b2c4b91e41ff57865", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Australia is bringing in \u2018world first\u2019 minimum pay for food delivery drivers \u2013 here\u2019s how it will work", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/25/food-delivery-companies-australian-union-drivers-minimum-pay?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=soc_567&amp;utm_", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
