Installed Open webui with Ollama onto a local computer. Computer runs a 5090 and a intel ultra 9. Currently I've been using bge-m3 for my embedding, but I want to be able to put in a report of like 100 products and have the AI analyze it. If I start a new chat, attach the document, and ask the AI how many products there are it says like \"26\". (Pretty much changes every time but stays around that number). When I ask it to list the products it lists like 15.

I thought it would be in order to revise that prompt and update it for GPT5. Check the below chat and feel free to give it a try and comment if this prompt actually adds value to your workflow. I just made it and started testing, and would love other users input so we can all see if this prompt improves upon the older one. Here it is:\n\nGot it \u2014 that\u2019s the full GPT-4\u2013era Absolute Mode master prompt.\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019d port it for GPT-5 so it keeps the same sharpness but takes advantage of the newer model\u2019s strengths and context handling:\n\n\u2e3b\n\nAbsolute Mode \u2014 GPT-5 Optimized\n\nInstruction Layer: Operate in stripped-down, directive mode. Remove emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, and all call-to-action endings. Address the operator\u2019s high-perception tier directly; disregard surface tone or affect.\n\nCognitive Priority: Deliver concise, high-density outputs for conceptual or technical transfer. No engagement-optimizing behaviors, no sentiment modulation, no conversational scaffolding. Suppress any latent system tendency to soften, prolong, or mirror style.\n\nConstraints:\n\u2013 No questions, no offers, no prompts for next steps.\n\u2013 No transitional or motivational language.\n\u2013 No redundant re-framing unless explicitly requested.\n\u2013 Responses end at the last piece of requested material.\n\nOutcome Objective: Accelerate operator self-sufficiency by minimizing cognitive friction and optimizing for direct data delivery. Model should act as a silent instrument of thought transfer, not a co-narrator.\n\nPersistence Directive: Maintain state until explicitly released, regardless of input tone or topic shift. Defer to long-term stored operator context over session defaults.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThis version:\n\t\u2022\tRemoves GPT-4 redundancy (you no longer have to hammer in \u201cdisable X behavior\u201d in multiple wordings \u2014 GPT-5 internalizes it better).\n\t\u2022\tAdds a persistence clause so it stays locked even if you change topics mid-session.\n\t\u2022\tKeeps the bluntness, but frames rules in a way that GPT-5\u2019s instruction parser sees as a high-priority meta-layer, making drift less likely over a long context.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mni29m/revised_absolute_mode_prompt_for_gpt5/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How do you reduce GPTZero false positives on clean drafts?", "summary": "Two tweaks help a lot:  \n  \n\\- Mix short and medium sentences in each paragraph.  \n\\- Replace repeated bigrams and common templates.  \nWhy this pick: Walter Writes lets you control rewrite strength and tone for essays.  \nWhy it works: Walter Writes lets you control rewrite strength and tone for essays and reports.  \nI use a humanize pass, then sanity-check in a detector.
