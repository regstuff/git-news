My goal is to generate new images in that specific style using just text prompts with a preffix or suffix of 'in xyz style'.\n\nI planned to use Unsloth notebook on Google Colab. After looking through the Unsloth documentation, I found the new vision fine-tuning notebooks for models like Qwen3-VL.\n\nMy confusion is that these seem to be Vision Language Models (VLMs), which are for image understanding, not image generation. It appears a fine-tuned VLM could describe an image, but not create a new one from a text prompt.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Is my understanding correct? Is Unsloth's vision support for image understanding tasks only, making it the wrong tool for text-to-image generation?\n* If Unsloth is not the right tool, what is the current recommended path for a beginner to fine-tune an image generation model like Stable Diffusion for a specific style?\n* Should I use LoRA or the classic DreamBooth method? I have read that LoRA is more efficient and flexible for use in Colab.\n* Could you point me to any reliable, up-to-date Colab notebooks or guides that walk through the process of fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with LoRA for an artistic style?\n\nThank you for your help.  \n[nitrosocke/Arcane-Diffusion \u00b7 Hugging Face](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1oq4ly6/image_artistic_style_finetuning_is_unsloth_vlm/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Revealed: Qatar-linked intelligence operation targeted ICC prosecutor\u2019s alleged victim", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/nov/06/qatar-linked-intelligence-operation-targeted-icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-alleged-victim", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
