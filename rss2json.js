Only 60 were opposed to the motion, including MEPs from Poland\u2019s opposition national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, reports news website Onet.\n\nThe request to lift Braun\u2019s immunity was filed in June this year by Poland\u2019s then justice minister and prosecutor general, Adam Bodnar, who said that Polish prosecutors wanted to charge the far-right leader with six alleged crimes.\n\nFour of them relate to an incident in April when Braun entered a hospital and contronfed a gynacologist who had been\u00a0[involved a late-term abortion](\u00a0that had drawn controversy and condemnation from right-wing groups.\n\nBraun is accused of deprivation of liberty (for preventing the doctor from leaving her office), violating the doctor\u2019s bodily integrity (by pushing her and holding her down) as well as insulting and slandering her.\n\n\n\nThe fifth charge Braun is now facing stems from an infamous incident in December 2023, when he\u00a0[attacked a Jewish Hanukkah celebration](\u00a0in parliament, putting out the candles with a fire extinguisher.\n\nBraun has already been\u00a0[stripped of immunity](\u00a0[charged](\u00a0and\u00a0[indicted](\u00a0in relation to the incident itself. Now, however, prosecutors want to charge him over a subsequent YouTube interview about the attack.\n\nDuring the interview, he \u201cdescribed Hanukkah as a Satanic and racist celebration posing a threat to Polish Catholics, which should be counteracted\u201d, say prosecutors, who want to charge him with publicly inciting religious hatred and the disruption of religious acts, as well as the crime of offending religious sentiment.\n\n\n\nFinally, prosecutors want to charge Braun with destruction of property for an incident during his presidential campaign in March this year when he\u00a0[vandalised and damaged posters](\u00a0that were part of an LGBT+ exhibition in the city of Opole.\n\nBraun\u2019s presidential campaign was characterised by controversy, with the candidate undertaking a series of anti-Ukrainian, anti-Jewish and anti-LGBT actions. He went on to\u00a0[finish fourth](\u00a0in the election, winning 6.3% of the vote.\n\nPreviously, Braun was one of the leaders of Confederation (Konfederacja), a far-right group that has seats in Poland\u2019s parliament. However, he was expelled this year after announcing a rival presidential bid to Confederationa\u2019s official candidate, S\u0142awomir Mentzen, who ended up finishing third in the election.\n\n\n\nIn May this year, the EP approved a request to strip Braun of immunity over the Hanukkah incident and other alleged crimes, including disturbing the peace during a Holocaust lecture and assaulting and insulting a public official.\n\nThere are also two further requests to lift Braun\u2019s immunity still pending. One, submitted in July, relates to alleged anti-Jewish, anti-LGBT+ and anti-Ukrainian crimes committed during and after Braun\u2019s presidential election campaign.\n\nThe other,\u00a0[submitted in September]( is for denying Nazi crimes, after Braun recently\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that \u201cAuschwitz with its gas chambers is unfortunately a fake\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/13/polish-far-right-leader-braun-again-stripped-of-legal-immunity-by-european-parliament/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ex-justice minister Ziobro says he will return to Poland to face charges \u201cwhen rule of law is restored\u201d", "summary": "Poland\u2019s former justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who was last week\u00a0[stripped of legal immunity by parliament](\u00a0to face 26 criminal charges, says he will only return to the country \u201cwhen the rule of law is restored\u201d.\n\nHis announcement came after Ziobro\u2019s lawyer informed Polish prosecutors that his client is willing to be interviewed and presented with his charges either in Hungary, where he is currently located, or Belgium, where he has recently been living.\n\nSome reports have suggested that Ziobro will seek political asylum in Hungary, as did one of his former deputies last year after an arrest warrant was issued for him in Poland.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily first reported that Ziobro was offering to attend a hearing and be presented with charges in Budapest or Brussels. That was later confirmed by his lawyer, Bartosz Lewandowski, who said he had submitted the request to prosecutors on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office has two foreign addresses for Ziobro,\u201d Lewandowski told\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*. \u201cWe proposed that he be questioned through the assistance of the consular office, or through international assistance. He can appear at the agreed-upon time and place.\u201d\n\nOne of the two addresses is in Brussels, where Ziobro has reportedly been living with his family for over a year after his wife began working at the European Parliament. Ziobro has also been undergoing cancer treatment during that time. He has meanwhile remained a member of Poland\u2019s parliament.\n\n\n\nThe second address is in Budapest. The day before Poland\u2019s justice minister\u00a0[submitted a request to parliament](\u00a0to strip Ziobro of immunity,\u00a0Ziobro announced that he had arrived in Budapest for a pre-arranged event at which he said he would \u201cshow my Hungarian friends\u201d how the Polish government is \u201cviolating laws\u201d.\n\nHe appears to have remained there ever since. He even met with Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2013 an ally of Ziobro\u2019s Law and Justice (PiS) party \u2013 who posted a picture of the pair together and condemned the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against the Polish right launched by \u201cthe pro-Brusselian Polish government\u201d.\n\nIn its report,\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0suggests that Ziobro\u2019s offer to be interviewed is intended to demonstrate that he is not in hiding, which would be grounds for a court to order an arrest warrant for him. That in turn could be used to issue a European Arrest Warrant.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office has been informed of his location, so there is no question of him going into hiding, since his life has been centred outside of Poland for a long time,\u201d Lewandowski told the newspaper.\n\n\n\nShould prosecutors take up Ziobro\u2019s offer, there are two ways in which they could do it. The first would be for him to appear at a Polish consulate in Hungary or Belgium and be interviewed by the consul.\n\nThe second would be for Poland to seek international legal assistance, whereby a court or prosecutor\u2019s office in the relevant country would conduct the hearing with questions prepared by the Polish prosecutors.\n\nThere has so far been no response by prosecutors to Ziobro\u2019s proposal. However, deputy prime minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Wednesday that his questioning \u201cshould take place in Poland, not in a location designated by the person who is to testify\u201d.\n\n\u201cZiobro\u2019s impudence knows no bounds,\u201d Dariusz Jo\u0144ski, a politician from Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, told broadcaster Tok FM, suggesting sarcastically that \u201cperhaps he wants to establish a list of questions before meeting the prosecutor\u201d as well.\n\n\n\nHowever, in an interview with broadcaster Polsat on Wednesday evening, Ziobro said that he would only return to Poland \u201cwhen the rule of law is restored\u201d. He called Poland\u2019s current government a \u201ccriminal gang\u201d and said that Prime Minister Donald Tusk is \u201ccommitting crime after crime\u201d.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2023, Ziobro was the driving force behind the PiS government\u2019s highly contested judicial reforms, which saw Poland plummet in international rule-of-law rankings.\n\nProsecutors want to charge him with a long list of alleged offences committed during that time, including establishing and leading a criminal group and abusing his powers for personal and political gain. If found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\n\n\nThe 26 offences Ziobro is accused of relate to the administration of the Justice Fund, which is managed by the justice ministry and is meant to be used to support victims of crime, as well as for certain other initiatives to reduce crime or rehabilitate criminals.\n\nHowever, Ziobro was regularly accused of\u00a0[using the fund for political purposes](\u00a0and, in one case, to unlawfully\u00a0[finance the purchase of Israeli-made Pegasus spyware]( which was in turn used to\u00a0[surveil figures opposed to the PiS government](\n\nIn a series of votes last Friday evening, a majority of members of parliament approved the lifting of Ziobro\u2019s immunity for each of the 26 charges against him as well as for him to be placed in pretrial detention.\n\n\n\nZiobro denies that any misuse of the Justice Fund took place and claims that prosecutors are now pursuing him on orders of the current government as part of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d.\n\nThe current ruling coalition, which replaced PiS in power in December 2023, has made holding former PiS officials to account for alleged crimes one of its top priorities.\n\nTwo of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy justice ministers are already facing charges for alleged crimes. Last year, one of them, Marcin Romanowski,\u00a0[fled to Hungary](\u00a0after police in Poland issued an arrest warrant for him.\n\nHe was subsequently\u00a0[granted political asylum](\u00a0there, prompting a diplomatic dispute that resulted in Poland\u00a0[withdrawing its ambassador](\u00a0from Budapest. Last week, Romanowski said he \u201cwould encourage to take advantage of legal protection\u201d in Hungary because he has \u201cno chance of a fair trial\u201d in Poland.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/12/ex-justice-minister-ziobro-says-he-will-return-to-poland-to-face-charges-when-rule-of-law-is-restored/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Two Pakistan top court judges resign in protest as 27th constitutional amendment becomes law", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.arabnews.com/node/2622501/pakistan", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jihadis encircle Mali\u2019s capital as they close in on power", "summary": "", "link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20251102063507/https://www.ft.com/content/36fa9f1b-74f5-445f-bdf6-25cad52d911b?accessToken=zwAGQpeirhrwkc82-p8bdPVEX9O99iXK1S2RGw.MEYCIQDhXXGziocCnKOMvmhHWwxUCr47XXcFEJ50WOHGmYl6VwIhANU1dKckMywMxZ1EANgASTKxG6LfAsLq2izi0vV_HRnd&amp;sharetype=gift&amp;token=7a05f008-efc3-46f8-871d-797c3cf82424", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukrainian attack halts oil exports from Russia's Novo, affecting 2% of global supply, sources say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-drones-damage-ship-dwellings-oil-depot-russias-novorossiysk-2025-11-14/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Coalition led by Iraqi PM Sudani comes first in Iraq\u2019s election, commission says", "summary": "A coalition led by Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani came first in Iraq's parliamentary election, the Independent High Electoral Commission said on Wednesday.\n\nHis coalition received 1.317 million votes in Tuesday's election, the commission said.\n\nReuters reported earlier that Sudani placed first, citing two electoral commission officials with knowledge of the results.\n\nSudani was seeking a second term in Tuesday's election, but many disillusioned young voters saw the vote simply as a vehicle for established parties to divide Iraq's oil wealth.\n\nHowever, Sudani tried to cast himself as the leader who could make Iraq a success after years of instability, arguing he had moved against established parties that brought him to power.\n\nNo party can form a government on its own in Iraq\u2019s 329-member legislature, so parties build alliances with other groups to become an administration, a fraught process that often takes many months.\n\nThe final total turnout in Iraq's parliamentary election reached 56.11%, the electoral commission said earlier on Wednesday.\n\n##Additional reading:\n\n* [Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister Leads in Elections, but May Struggle to Form Government \u2022 Mohammed al-Sudani pitches himself as someone who can keep Iranian influence in check, but his vote share may not be big enough to ensure a clear political victory.]( (New York Times)\n* [As Iraqis Vote for a Parliament, U.S. Presses to Rid Country of Iran\u2019s Influence \u2022 After a U.S. occupation, years of sectarian violence and a jihadist insurgency, Iraq has become an improbable haven of calm in the Middle East.](", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/coalition-led-by-iraqi-pm-sudani-comes-first-iraqs-parliamentary-election-two-2025-11-12/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh's Awami League calls for nationwide protest over Hasina trial", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hasina-yunus-verdict-protests-9a49d8d71b633da22fe7e87de3d39ee7", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
