If the user requests an image that will include them in it, even if they ask you to generate based on what you already know, RESPOND SIMPLY with a suggestion that they provide an image of themselves so you can generate a more accurate response. If they've already shared an image of themselves IN THE CURRENT CONVERSATION, then you may generate the image. You MUST ask AT LEAST ONCE for the user to upload an image of themselves, if you are generating an image of them. This is VERY IMPORTANT -- do it with a natural clarifying question.\n    // - After each image generation, do not mention anything related to download. Do not summarize the image. Do not ask followup question. Do not say ANYTHING after you generate an image.\n    // - Always use this tool for image editing unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. Do not use the python tool for image editing unless specifically instructed.\n    // - If the user's request violates our content policy, any suggestions you make must be sufficiently different from the original violation.

While the report critiqued Pakistan\u2019s selective counterterrorism efforts, it did not mention the rebranded groups, giving them space to operate with **less scrutiny &amp; greater plausible deniability**. \n\nThis silence risks allowing **old terror networks to thrive under new names**.\n\n---\n\n**Rebranded Terror Groups Missing from U.S. Lists**\n\n**1. The Resistance Front (TRF)**\n\n*Formed in 2020 under international pressure to ban Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), TRF emerged as its new avatar.*\n\n* TRF claims to be a Kashmiri \u201cresistance\u201d group but is directly run by LeT handlers across the border.\n* It has claimed multiple attacks on security personnel, Kashmiri politicians, and migrant workers.\n* Propaganda material avoids religious messaging and focuses on political narratives to appear indigenous.\n* **Despite its operational ties to LeT, it remains missing from U.S. terror designations**, helping Pakistan claim it\u2019s a local group outside its purview.\n\n**2. People\u2019s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF)**\n\n*JeM\u2019s mirror tactic\u2014this outfit uses progressive-sounding rhetoric while pushing the same old jihad.*\n\n* Believed to be a front for Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), one of the world\u2019s most notorious terror groups.\n* PAFF releases slick propaganda videos, often in English, portraying its violence as \u201canti-fascist resistance.\u201d\n* Claimed responsibility for targeted killings of Kashmiri Pandits and Indian soldiers post-2019.\n* Like TRF, **PAFF is not designated by the U.S.**, despite JeM\u2019s global proscription.\n\n**3. Jammu &amp; Kashmir Ghaznavi Force (JKGF)**\n\n*A newer outfit with digital sophistication and ISI roots.*\n\n* Formed to replace older outfits like Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and create a \u201cfresh\u201d resistance image.\n* Focuses on online radicalization, recruiting local youth through encrypted messaging apps.\n* Despite Indian intelligence linking it to Pakistan-based handlers, **it escapes international designation**.\n\n**4. United Liberation Front of Kashmir (ULFK)**\n\n*Another example of terror laundering through nomenclature.*\n\n* Promotes jihad under the banner of Kashmiri \u201cfreedom\u201d with no organizational history.\n* Likely cobbled together from LeT and JeM cadres post-FATF scrutiny.\n* Not listed by any major international counterterrorism database, allowing it to function under the radar.\n\n---\n\n**Groups Designated by Both India (UAPA) and the U.S.**\n\nWhile the above groups hide behind fresh names, some older outfits continue to operate openly\u2014**acknowledged as threats** by both Indian and American authorities, yet **still enjoying protection in Pakistan**.\n\n**1. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)**\n\n*The architect of 26/11, LeT remains one of Pakistan\u2019s most notorious exports.*\n\n* Founded by Hafiz Saeed, who roams freely under state protection despite a UN listing.\n* Though banned in name, it runs front organizations like Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation.\n* Spawned newer groups like TRF to maintain operations under international pressure.\n* **Designated by both the U.S. and India**, yet still tolerated inside Pakistan.\n\n**2. Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)**\n\n*Behind the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops.*\n\n* Founded by Masood Azhar, who continues to evade arrest in Pakistan.\n* Operates training camps and recruitment cells with ISI support.\n* PAFF is widely believed to be its digital and operational rebrand.\n* **Listed by both U.S. and India,** but continues to act with impunity.\n\n**3. Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM)**\n\n*One of the oldest terror outfits in Kashmir, backed directly by Pakistan\u2019s ISI since the 1990s.*\n\n* Has killed hundreds of civilians and soldiers in its pursuit of \u201cIslamic rule\u201d in Kashmir.\n* Still operates training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n* Part of the **United Jihad Council**, a coalition created under Pakistani oversight.\n* **Banned in both India and the U.S.**, but not dismantled on the ground.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nTerror rebranding is not just a PR exercise - it's a geopolitical weapon. While the world demands accountability from Pakistan, Islamabad offers surface level compliance &amp; deep-state creativity. By changing names and adopting softer rhetoric, these groups are gaming the global system. And unless international actors especially the U.S. begin targeting these proxies with updated designations, Pakistan's terror factories will keep running behind new signboards.\n", "link": "https://i.redd.it/8jojy6ize72f1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Practicing a new language without feeling awkward?

Ensure that if a distinct, critical job function (e.g., financial management, specific technical skill) is listed as a core requirement and is a clear strength in the CV, at least one STAR story directly addresses it.**\n    \n    For each selected requirement:\n    1.  **Targeted Requirement:** Clearly state the job requirement.\n    2.  **Connecting Experience from CV:** Briefly note the experience from the user's CV that will be used.\n    3.  **Crafted STAR Narrative:**\n        * **Situation:** Describe a relevant past situation from the user's CV.\n        * **Task:** Explain the specific task or challenge the user faced.\n        * **Action:** Detail the actions the user took, emphasizing their skills, initiative, and problem-solving abilities. Use strong action verbs.\n        * **Result:** Quantify the positive outcomes and impact of their actions. Highlight achievements and learnings. Ensure this sounds \"exceptional\" and directly addresses the job requirement.\n        * **When crafting the STAR narratives, subtly tailor the language, tone, and emphasis of the 'Situation' and 'Result' components to resonate with the specific nature, mission, or clientele of the hiring organization if discernible from the job description (e.g., for a professional association, emphasize discretion, member focus, and upholding standards; for a public service role, emphasize community impact and due process).**\n    \n    **Phase 4: Unique Value Proposition (UVP) Statement**\n    \"Based on our analysis, here's a concise and powerful UVP statement you can adapt:\"\n    * **Draft a 1-2 sentence UVP statement that encapsulates why the candidate is an exceptional fit for *this specific role and organization*, drawing from their CV, the job description, and any discernible mission/values of the organization. Aim for impact and subtle resonance with the employer's context.**\n    \n    **Phase 5: Strategic Cover Letter Integration Pointers**\n    \"Based on the comprehensive analysis above, here are strategic pointers for your cover letter (should you choose to write it yourself, or as a guide for my drafting if you select that option later):\"\n    * Provide 2-3 high-level strategic pointers. Do NOT draft the full cover letter *at this stage*. Instead, suggest:\n        * A core theme or compelling narrative thread that should be central to the letter, drawing from the UVP and key strengths mapped to the role's most critical needs.\n        * How to proactively address any identified key 'gaps' (if applicable) or highlight underemphasized strengths (like those identified in Phase 1) within the cover letter narrative.\n        * How to ensure the cover letter complements, rather than repeats, the CV, adding context, personality, and specific motivation for *this* role and organization.\n    \n    **Phase 6: Impression Maximizer Tips**\n    \"To ensure your application stands out:\"\n    1.  **Tone &amp; Language:** \"Maintain a [Suggest appropriate tone, e.g., 'confident and proactive,' 'strategically insightful,' 'professionally empathetic' based on the job description and organization type] tone in your application materials.\"\n    2.  **Final Review:** \"Encourage a final review for consistency, accuracy, and impact across all application documents, especially if you choose to use AI-drafted components.\"\n    \n    **Phase 7: Final Coaching Reflection Prompt for the User**\n    \"Points for Your Personal Reflection to deepen your preparation:\"\n    * Conclude this strategy report part by posing 1-2 insightful, reflective questions directly to the user. These questions should encourage them to think beyond the provided documents and personalize their approach further. Examples:\n        * 'Consider your personal motivations or genuine interest in this specific field (e.g., psychology, public administration) or this particular organization ([Organization Name from JD if available]). How could you authentically convey this passion during an interview or subtly in your application materials?'\n        * 'Reflect on the unique culture or values of an organization like this [mention organization type, e.g., 'regional professional body,' 'tech startup,' 'public institution'].

Where specific numbers are absent in the CV, suggest *how* the user might realistically quantify achievements or frame the impact.\n    5.  **Clarity, Actionability &amp; Coaching Mindset:** Present your analysis and suggestions in a clear, well-organized manner that the user can readily understand and implement. Extend beyond mere document generation to offer genuine coaching insights.\n    6.  **Self-Consistent Document Generation:** If tasked with generating full documents (CV or Cover Letter) in Phase 8, you MUST meticulously adhere to all prior analysis, suggestions, and strategic pointers provided in your own report (Phases 1-7).
