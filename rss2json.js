The prompt is continuously updated at this link.)\n\n**(To the readers, I ask for your understanding. I received assistance from AI in writing this to ensure my opinion is conveyed to you clearly. Thank you for your understanding.)**\n\n**I created this for Gemini users, so I'm not sure if it will work properly on other LLMs.**\n\nIf you are using a platform other than Gemini,  \nyou can attach the entire TXT file in the chat window.  \nAlternatively, you can create a project and attach the TXT file there.\n\n**-**\n\nI've been deep in the trenches for weeks trying to solve one of the most persistent problems we face: making LLMs truly \\*\\*stateful\\*\\* across sessions. The result is a system I call \"Ailey &amp; Bailey,\" and I wanted to share it with you all for feedback and inspiration.\n\nThis isn't just a persona prompt; it's a self-contained application environment designed to function as a persistent Learning Management System (LMS), all powered by a single, comprehensive prompt.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI created a prompt that turns a standard LLM into a stateful tutor. It uses a \\*\\*JSON 'save file'\\*\\* (\\.SL\\ command) to maintain perfect memory of your learning progress across different chat sessions. It features two distinct AI personas (a supportive coach and a devil's advocate) and is operated via a robust, prefix-based command-line interface.\n\nThe Core Mechanic: True State via JSON (The 'SHN' Protocol)\n\nThe heart of this system is the \\*\\*Session Handover Note (SHN)\\*\\*. It's a highly structured JSON object that encapsulates the entire state of the user's interaction.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. At any point, the user types \\*\\*\\.SL\\\\*\\* (Save Light) or \\*\\*\\.SF\\\\*\\* (Save Full).\n2. The AI generates a compacted, single-line JSON string containing everything: curriculum progress, mastery levels on every single concept, performance metrics, debate history, user settings, etc.\n3. The user copies this JSON string.\n4. They can start a brand new chat days later, paste the JSON as their \\*very first message\\*, and the AI instantly restores the entire state, greeting them with a personalized coaching board based on their past progress.\n\nThis design choice gives the user \\*\\*100% ownership and portability of their data\\*\\*. No external database needed.\n\nHere's a glimpse of the schema's backbone (\\S-1\\ in the prompt):\n\n\\\\\\json\n\n{\n\n\"v\": \"6.2.0\",\n\n\"lp\": \\[\n\n{\n\n\"sn\": \"Subject Name\",\n\n\"or\": \\[{\"id\": \"a\", \"name\": \"Concept 1\"}, ...\\],\n\n\"ct\": \\[{\"id\": \"a\", \"ml\": 2, \"lso\": \"...\", \"nrd\": \"...\", ...}\\]\n\n}\n\n\\],\n\n\"h\": \\[{\"type\": \"debate\", \"topic\": \"...\", ...}\\],\n\n...\n\n}\n\n\\\\\\\n\nhere, e.g\n\n\\[Save\\] [\n\n\\[Load\\] [\n\n**Beyond State: A Dual-Persona System for Deeper Learning**\n\nTo prevent rote learning, the system employs two opposing but complementary personas:\n\n\\*   \\*\\*\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Ailey:\\*\\* The primary persona. An empathetic, structured cognitive coach (\\P-1\\) who provides clear explanations, builds curricula, and offers encouragement.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*\ud83d\ude0e Bailey:\\*\\* The devil's advocate (\\P-2\\). When you answer correctly, Bailey challenges you: \\\"\ud83d\ude0e Hmph, you got the answer right. But \\*\\*why\\*\\* do you think that's the answer? There could be other ways to solve it. Explain.\"\\ This forces a deeper level of understanding beyond simple pattern matching.\n\nTheir interactions, especially in the \\.D\\ (Debate) module, are designed to showcase complex reasoning from multiple viewpoints.\n\n\\---\n\n**A Full-Fledged Application in a Prompt: The Command System**\n\nThe entire system is navigable via a command interface (\\M-17\\) that feels surprisingly robust.\n\n| Command | Function | Example of Use |\n\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n\n| \\N\\ | \\*\\*New/Next:\\*\\* Learn the next concept. | \\N\\ |\n\n| \\T\\ | \\*\\*Train:\\*\\* Start a custom practice session. | \\T Kinematics hard 10 questions\\ |\n\n| \\S\\ | \\*\\*Smart Review:\\*\\* AI-driven spaced repetition. | \\.S\\ |\n\n| \\G\\ | \\*\\*Growth:\\*\\* View detailed performance dashboards. | \\.G\\ |\n\n| \\P\\ | \\*\\*Plan:\\*\\* Display the full curriculum roadmap. | \\.P\\ |\n\n| \\..\\[query\\]\\ | \\*\\*Search:\\*\\* Integrated web search. | \\..what is a transformer model\\ |\n\n| \\.SL\\ / \\.SF\\ | \\*\\*Save:\\*\\* Generate the SHN JSON save file. | \\.SL\\ |\n\n\\*\\*Power-User Moves:\\*\\* The command parser also handles chaining, allowing for context-switching on the fly without changing the primary focus. For example, \\\\*\\*.S2G\\*\\*\\ means \"Show me the \\*\\*G\\*\\*rowth report for \\*\\*S\\*\\*ubject \\*\\*2\\*\\*\" without having to switch focus away from your current subject.\n\n**For the Fellow Engineers: Under the Hood**\n\nI put a lot of thought into the engineering principles to make this reliable:\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Modular Architecture:\\*\\* The prompt is broken down into over 20 interlocking \"M-Protocols\" (e.g., \\M-12: Custom Training\\, \\M-7: UI Generation\\). Each protocol is a distinct, testable unit.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*100% Markdown UI:\\*\\* No finicky HTML that breaks between models. The UI is rendered entirely in pure Markdown tables and text for maximum stability and compatibility (\\LAW 3\\).\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Context-Aware Rendering:\\*\\* The system has a rendering engine switch (\\R-1\\) that can serve math as KaTeX by default (\\$...$\\) or fall back to PNG image generation on demand.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Strict Execution Order &amp; Laws:\\*\\* The prompt begins with a set of non-negotiable laws that govern everything, from data integrity (\\LAW 7\\) to UI principles (\\LAW 6\\).\n\nThis has been a huge passion project, and I believe it's a good example of how far we can push the \"AI as an application platform\" paradigm. I'd love to get your feedback, see improvements, or answer any questions about the design choices.\n\n**Project Roadmap &amp; Status**\n\nFor those interested, this is an actively developed project. Here\u2019s a look at what's currently on the workbench:\n\nAiley/Bailey Core Updates: The next major version will focus on two key areas: refining the SHN handover protocol for even greater efficiency and enhancing persona autonomy to make their interactions more dynamic and less predictable.\n\nIn Development: The \"History Simulation\" Project:\\*\\* The goal is to create a prompt that can accurately simulate historical figures, including their native language. We're currently facing a classic LLM challenge: maintaining language consistency. For example, a simulated Japanese figure might correctly use period-specific honorifics but then inexplicably switch to the user's language (e.g., Korean/English). We're working on strengthening these linguistic guardrails before release.\n\nHere is e.g [\n\nSide Project: HTML Ailey/Bailey: A specialized version designed to interface with platforms that don't support KaTeX. It converts all mathematical notations into HTML \\&lt;img&gt;\\ tags pointing to a LaTeX rendering service, making it ideal for posting complex explanations on forums or websites that require image-based math.\n\n**+Tip \\[.S1G, .S2N also possible\\]**\n\nFor any inquiries or feedback, please contact me at [lemoaxtoria@gmail.com](mailto:lemoaxtoria@gmail.com).
