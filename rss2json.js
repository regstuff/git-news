Sorry in advance for the long post. I (30F) got my MA in Classical Studies (w/ a focus on archaeology) in 2019 and, for a lot of reasons, I decided not to pursue my PhD at the time.\n\n\n\nI'm now definitely certain I want to pursue my PhD, although with a slightly different focus--I think I want to study classical archaeology and its intersection with imperialism &amp; colonialism, in particular--so a little bit of reception studies, basically, although I'm also very interested in mortuary studies as well (especially in the Early Iron Age/Archaic Period in Greece). After a lot of back and forth (like...a lot)--I've decided to apply this upcoming fall, for fall 2026 cohort (hopefully!).\n\n\n\nI've been seeing stuff on Twitter though that it has become increasingly difficult for people be accepted into PhD programs in the humanities &amp; social sciences. I'll admit that I don't think I have a whole lot that will make me stand out right now--I'm doing classes now (although mostly in medieval stuff, the university I work at doesn't have a ton in terms of Latin/Greek and archaeology, and I was sort of considering exploring a later time period). I've also done German and French for reading knowledge, but I can't speak either. I have a tiny bit of Spanish under my belt, but it needs a lot of help.\n\n  \nI've always heard writing sample &amp; letters of rec can be the most helpful--which I think should be okay. But is there anything else I can do to make my application stand out? I only got to dig one season, but I plan on digging again this summer (have been accepted to one in Italy, still waiting to hear back from one in Greece).\n\n  \nAny thoughts or advice on what programs are looking for would be super helpful! I'm definitely thinking I should focus my attention on learning modern Greek--but not sure what else would be a good idea.\n\n  \nThank you all in advance for any help you can provide!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ig6kk5/how_to_make_an_application_for_classical/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine peace talks without Kyiv would send \u2018very dangerous\u2019 signal: Zelenskyy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/negotiating-peace-ukraine-america-russia-signal-dictators-act-impunity-volodymyr-zelenskyy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More states outlaw the \"exception clause\"[to slavery in US]", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.freedomunited.org/news/states-banning-prison-labor/?trk_msg=DT21HDNASSA4V1R8RF460JS55K&amp;trk_contact=CLEG5NF2S50DG47E9DVM9F9T1C&amp;trk_sid=FST4SLMRPD0FEEUVU19S430HRC&amp;trk_link=E08OEN33QIE4F7P1JGDHJVGLIK&amp;utm_source=Listrak&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=Read+more...&amp;utm_campaign=News+Digest_02.02.2025+core+supporters&amp;utm_content=News+Digest_02.02.2025+core+supporters", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
