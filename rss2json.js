Canada currently enjoys the lowest effective tariff rate with the United States globally, while still seeing some key industries suffer from Mr. Trump\u2019s levies on autos, steel, aluminum and lumber.\n\nBut Canada also faces a review by this summer of its free-trade agreement with the United States and Mexico, which Mr. Trump is [considering abandoning]( at least in part.\n\nIn response to this volatility and Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestions that the United States take over Canada, Mr. Carney was elected to find a new normal in the important relationship, but also to strengthen Canada\u2019s links to other economies around the world.\n\nMr. Carney has traveled relentlessly \u2014 more than most Western leaders, a New York Times review shows \u2014 to secure investments and build relationships with countries in Europe and in Asia.\n\n# India: Bygones be bygones?\n\nMr. Carney\u2019s first stop is in Mumbai, where he lands Friday to meet business leaders before heading to New Delhi to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.\n\nIt\u2019s the most important and hardest part of his three-stop tour.\n\nJust over a year ago, Mr. Carney\u2019s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, disclosed that Canadian intelligence services and law enforcement believed that Indian diplomats in Canada, under orders from the government in New Delhi, had [helped orchestrate political assassinations]( [extortions and intimidation campaigns]( targeting Sikhs on Canadian soil.\n\nThe two countries nearly suspended diplomatic relations after Mr. Trudeau\u2019s 2024 statement, and expelled each other\u2019s top diplomats. But after Mr. Carney\u2019s election last spring, a thaw began, culminating in this visit.\n\nMr. Carney is trying to set all that aside as he seeks to announce important agreements with Mr. Modi, particularly to sell oil and uranium to India, officials said. India is a big potential market for Canadian oil, the vast majority of which currently goes south to the United States.\n\n# Australian Cousins, Japanese Partners\n\nMr. Carney\u2019s Australia visit is likely to be more like a family reunion. Those familial ties include a similar federal structure and political system, as well as economic traits, such as important mining sectors.\n\nBut some business is on the table in Australia, especially around investment prospects for each nation\u2019s well-endowed and mighty pension funds.\n\nMr. Carney\u2019s final stop is Japan, an important defense partner for Canada in the region, and joint pursuit of stability in the Indo-Pacific is likely to be high on the agenda.\n\nCanadian Armed Forces participate in numerous joint exercises and missions alongside Japanese counterparts.\n\nThe two countries, which are quintessential \u201cmiddle powers\u201d and both members of the Group of 7 biggest industrialized economies in the world, have long enjoyed a close relationship. But Mr. Carney is eager to pursue more economic cooperation with Japan, which has also expressed interest in buying more Canadian natural gas.\n\n-----\n\n[Here's a copy of the full article]( in case you get blocked from the original page.\n\n-----\n\n#See also:\n\n* [Prime Minister Carney to travel to India, Australia and Japan to diversify Canada trade away from US]( (Associated Press)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/world/canada/carney-asia-australia-visit.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mass graves found in eastern Congo after rebel withdrawal, governor says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/mass-graves-found-eastern-congo-after-rebel-withdrawal-governor-says-2026-02-27/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish Supreme Court picks candidates for new chief justice despite boycott by some judges", "summary": "Poland\u2019s Supreme Court has nominated five candidates to become its new chief justice, replacing the outgoing Ma\u0142gorzata Manowska, whose six-year term will come to an end in May. President Karol Nawrocki will now decide which of the candidates will become the new head of the court.\n\nHowever, the process has been shrouded in controversy, as it was\u00a0[six years ago]( due to the ongoing\u00a0[rule-of-law crisis](\u00a0in Poland. Many of the court\u2019s judges have boycotted the election for a new chief justice as they do not recognise the legitimacy of their colleagues.\n\nThe process of choosing a new chief justice begins with the Supreme Court\u2019s judges (of whom there are currently 91) voting to select a shortlist of candidates from among their own members.\n\nThe five candidates who receive the most votes are then presented to the president, who must select one of them, at his own discretion, to become the new head of the court.\n\nManowska, who decided not to stand for a second term, originally called a meeting on Tuesday this week to select candidates to replace her. For that to take place, a quorum of 84 judges needed to be present. However, only 48 attended, meaning the meeting was cancelled.\n\nThe reason for the low attendance was that a large minority of judges on the Supreme Court have boycotted the process of choosing a new chief justice because they regard the majority of their colleagues, including Manowska, as holding their positions illegitimately.\n\nThe dispute stems from a decision by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government to overhaul the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), the body responsible for nominating judges, in 2017.\n\nPreviously, the KRS\u2019s members had been chosen mostly by judges themselves; after PiS\u2019s reforms, most were chosen by politicians. That rendered the KRS illegitimate, according to multiple\u00a0[Polish](\u00a0and\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings, as well as many expert bodies and Polish judges themselves.\n\nAs a consequence, many \u201cold\u201d judges appointed before the KRS reform regard \u201cnew\u201d judges appointed since then as illegitimate. On the Supreme Court, for example, over 60% of judges are \u201cnew\u201d and many of their \u201cold\u201d colleagues\u00a0[refuse to cooperate with them](\n\nA group of 29 \u201cold\u201d judges jointly signed a letter this week saying that they were refusing to participate in the election because Manowska herself, who launched the process, holds her position illegitimately while the participation of other \u201cnew\u201d judges also renders the elections invalid.\n\n\u201cWe will not participate in this theatre,\u201d one of the rebel judges, W\u0142odzimierz Wr\u00f3bel, told broadcaster TVN. \u201cThe entire procedure is\u2026not consistent with the law or the constitution.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Manowska attempted to hold a second meeting to choose candidates. Under the court\u2019s regulations, this time the quorum was lowered to 75. However, that figure was again not reached, with only 51 judges showing up.\n\nOn Thursday, a third meeting was called, with the quorum this time lowered to 32. Court spokesman Igor Zgoli\u0144ski confirmed that 53 judges had attended, allowing the meeting to take place. Six candidates to be the new chief justice were chosen, all of them \u201cnew\u201d judges.\n\nOn Friday, a vote then took place to choose the five who would be presented to the president. The candidate with the highest number of votes, 18, was\u00a0Zbigniew Kapi\u0144ski, a judge from the Supreme Court\u2019s criminal chamber.\n\nThe other four candidates who will be presented to Nawrocki are:\u00a0Mariusz Za\u0142ucki\u00a0(who received 13 votes),\u00a0Pawe\u0142 Czubik\u00a0(nine votes),\u00a0Aleksander St\u0119pkowski (five votes)\u00a0and\u00a0Tomasz Demendecki (five votes).\n\nThe final candidate,\u00a0Agnieszka G\u00f3ra-B\u0142aszczykowska, also received five votes, forcing a run-off with St\u0119powski and Demendecki. But in that second round she gained the fewest votes and was therefore eliminated.\n\nWhen Nawrocki makes his decision, he does not have to take into account how many votes each candidate received. He has complete discretion to choose any of the five candidates presented to him.\n\nNawrocki is aligned with PiS and accepts the legitimacy of the overhauled KRS and the \u201cnew\u201d judges nominated by it. However, the current government, which replaced PiS in office in December 2023, takes the opposite view.\n\nIt has sought to restore the KRS to its previous state before PiS\u2019s reforms. But Nawrocki earlier this month\u00a0[vetoed legislation](\u00a0to that effect.\n\nMeanwhile, the president\u00a0[submitted his own proposed law](\u00a0that would jail officials for up to ten years if they \u201cpersistently question\u201d his powers or those of judicial bodies filled with PiS-era appointees, such as the Supreme Court and Constitutional Tribunal (TK).\n\nManowska herself has clashed regularly with the current government. In December 2023, she and the head of the TK\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0proposals to roll back PiS-era reforms. Last year, she\u00a0[accused the government](\u00a0of an \u201cunlawful and audacious attack on the independence of the Supreme Court\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court\u00a0[rejected a request](\u00a0by prosecutors to strip Manowska of legal immunity so that she can face charges of abusing her powers.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/27/polish-supreme-court-picks-candidates-for-new-chief-justice-despite-boycott-by-some-judges/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish parliament pledges to take into account judiciary\u2019s picks for council at heart of rule-of-law dispute", "summary": "The government\u2019s majority in parliament has adopted a resolution pledging to take into account the wishes of the judicial community when selecting new members of the body responsible for nominating judges.\n\nThe move represents a \u201cplan B\u201d adopted by the government after opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki vetoed a bill that would have changed how\u00a0members of the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS) are chosen.\n\nUntil 2017, most of KRS\u2019s members were elected by judges themselves. That year, however, the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government changed the system so that most members were chosen by politicians.\n\nThat political influence removed the KRS\u2019s independence and thereby rendered it illegitimate, according to multiple\u00a0[Polish](\u00a0and\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings, as well as many expert bodies and Polish judges themselves.\n\nThe current government has pledged to restore the legitimacy of the KRS by again having most members elected by judges.
