Significant savings without sacrificing quality \u2014 especially when paired with OpenWebUI.\n\nThis experience led me to a suggestion that could benefit the entire OpenWebUI community:\n\n# Proposed Feature: Built-in Smart LLM Routing + Transparent Cost Reporting\n\nOpenWebUI could natively support **dynamic model routing** with a standardized output format that shows exactly which models were used and how much they cost. This would transform OpenWebUI from a simple frontend into a true **cost-aware orchestration platform**.\n\nHere\u2019s a ready-to-use schema I\u2019ve already implemented in my own proxy (*claudinio cli*) that could be adopted as an official OpenWebUI protocol:\n\n    {\n      \"LLMRouterOutput\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"description\": \"Complete breakdown of all models used in processing a request. Includes both the router model (task analysis &amp; selection) and completion model(s).\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"models\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"List of all models used, in order of invocation\",\n            \"items\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/LLMRouterOutputEntry\" }\n          },\n          \"total_cost_usd\": {\n            \"type\": \"number\",\n            \"minimum\": 0.0,\n            \"description\": \"Total cost across all models in USD\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"additionalProperties\": true\n      },\n      \"LLMRouterOutputEntry\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"description\": \"Information about a single model invocation\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"model\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Model identifier (e.g., 'mistralai/devstral-small')\"\n          },\n          \"role\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"enum\": [\"router\", \"completion\"],\n            \"description\": \"'router' for task analysis, 'completion' for response generation\"\n          },\n          \"usage\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/ModelUsageDetail\" }\n        },\n        \"additionalProperties\": true\n      },\n      \"ModelUsageDetail\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"description\": \"Detailed token and cost breakdown\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"input_tokens\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 },\n          \"output_tokens\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 },\n          \"total_tokens\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 },\n          \"input_cost_usd\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": 0.0 },\n          \"output_cost_usd\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": 0.0 },\n          \"total_cost_usd\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": 0.0 }\n        },\n        \"additionalProperties\": true\n      }\n    }\n\n# Why this matters:\n\n* Users see **exactly** where their money goes (no more surprise bills)\n* Enables **community-shared routing configs** (e.g., \u201cbest for code\u201d, \u201ccheapest for planning\u201d)\n* Turns OpenWebUI into a **smart spending dashboard**\n* Works with any OpenAI-compatible proxy (including home-grown ones like mine at **claudin.io**)\n\nI\u2019ve been running this exact setup for weeks and it\u2019s been a game-changer. Would love to see OpenWebUI lead the way in transparent, cost-aware AI workflows.\n\nIf you try something similar (or want to test my router at [**claudin.io**]( please share your feedback.

I recently started getting more interested in Language Technology, so I decided to do my bachelor's thesis in this field.

(I cannot post links, I will try and link it in the comments). He seemed a bit disinterested in the idea but told me I could choose any topic that I find interesting.\n\nI was wondering what you all think: would this be a good task to base a bachelor's thesis on? And what do you think of the task itself?\n\nAlso, I\u2019m planning to submit a paper to the workshop after completing the task, since I think having at least one publication could help with my master\u2019s applications.

I\u2019m a southeastern CRM arch at a very large firm. I love my job and am good at it, but my pay is really crap, even for SE standards. I wrap up my PhD in a few months and for the last decade have specialized in collections management and digitization. My current job lets me be a research archaeologist (and lab manager) without having to be in academia. I have been thinking about the types of jobs I want to apply to around Jan/Feb after the holiday slowdown (and after my defense date is set). Honestly, I\u2019d stay at my job if they paid me more, but they recently denied a cost of living adjustment and raise. \n\nMy advisor just informed me that the two state collections jobs will be opening up early next year. It\u2019s pretty much my dream job - but 4 hours away and the pay would never be more than (maybe not even match) what I currently make (which is already crappy). BUT it means better/cheaper health insurance and higher take home pay even if I was making the same amount that I am now. \n\nGuess I\u2019m just looking for advice from those of you who have worked in a state position (not federal), or those who have gone from public to private or vic versa.
