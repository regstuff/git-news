Here's the knowledge extraction system that changed how I learn forever", "summary": "We all have a YouTube \"Watch Later\" list that's a graveyard of good intentions. That 2-hour lecture, that 30-minute tutorial, that brilliant deep-dive podcast\u2014all packed with knowledge you want, but you just don't have the time.\n\nWhat if you could stop\u00a0*watching*\u00a0and start\u00a0*knowing*? What if you could extract the core ideas, secret strategies, and \"aha\" moments from any video in about 60 seconds?\n\nThis guide will show you how. We'll use AI tools like Perplexity and Gemini to not only analyze single videos but to deconstruct entire YouTube channels for rapid learning, creator research, or competitive intelligence. A simple \"summarize this\" is for beginners. We're going to teach the AI to think like a strategic analyst.\n\n# The \"Super-Prompts\" for Single Video Analysis\n\nThis is your foundation. Choose your tool, grab the corresponding prompt, and get a strategic breakdown of any video in seconds.\n\n# Option A: The Perplexity \"Research Analyst\" Prompt\n\n**Best for:**\u00a0Deep, multi-source analysis that pulls context from the creator's other work across the web.\n\n**The 60-Second Method:**\n\n1. Go to\u00a0**perplexity.ai**.\n2. Copy the YouTube video URL.\n3. Paste the following prompt and your link.\n\n**Perplexity Super-Prompt**  \n  \nAct as an expert research analyst and content strategist. Your goal is to deconstruct the provided YouTube video to extract its fundamental components, core message, and strategic elements. From this YouTube video, perform the following analysis:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Outline:** Generate a detailed, hierarchical outline of the video's structure with timestamps (HH:MM:SS).\u00a0  \n2. **Core Insights:** Distill the 5-7 most critical insights or \"aha\" moments.\u00a0  \n3. **The Hook:** Quote the exact hook from the first 30 seconds and explain the technique used (e.g., poses a question, states a shocking fact).\u00a0  \n4. **Actionable Takeaways:** List the most important, actionable steps a viewer should implement.\u00a0  \n5. **Holistic Synthesis:** Briefly search for the creator's other work (blogs, interviews) on this topic and add 1-2 sentences of context. Does this video expand on or contradict their usual perspective?\n\nAnalyze this video: [PASTE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK HERE]\n\n# Option B: The Gemini \"Strategic Analyst\" Prompt\n\n**Best for:**\u00a0Fluent, structured analysis that leverages Google's native YouTube integration for a deep dive into the video itself.\n\n**The 60-Second Method:**\n\n1. Go to\u00a0**gemini.google.com**.\n2. Go to\u00a0**Settings**\u00a0\\&gt;\u00a0**Extensions**\u00a0and ensure the\u00a0**YouTube**\u00a0extension is enabled.\n3. Copy the YouTube video URL.\n4. Paste the following prompt and your link.\n\n**Gemini Super-Prompt**\n\nAct as a world-class strategic analyst using your native YouTube extension. Your analysis should be deep, insightful, and structured for clarity.\n\nFor the video linked below, please provide the following:\n\n1. **The Core Thesis:** In a single, concise sentence, what is the absolute central argument of this video?\u00a0  \n2. **Key Pillars of Argument:** Present the 3-5 main arguments that support the core thesis.\u00a0  \n3. **The Hook Deconstructed:** Quote the hook from the first 30 seconds and explain the psychological trigger it uses (e.g., \"Creates an information gap,\" \"Challenges a common belief\").\u00a0  \n4. **Most Tweetable Moment:** Identify the single most powerful, shareable quote from the video and present it as a blockquote.  \n5. **Audience &amp; Purpose:** Describe the target audience and the primary goal the creator likely had (e.g., \"Educate beginners,\" \"Build brand affinity\").\n\nAnalyze this video: [PASTE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK HERE]\n\n  \nThe Gemini prompt is my favorite for analyzing videos in 60 seconds and really pulling out the key points.  Saves so many hours I don't have to watch videos where people often have a few good points but go on and on about a lot of nothing.\n\nI then built an app with Lovable, Supabase and the Gemini API and started analyzing entire YT channels to understand the best videos, what content gets the most views and likes, and I also studied the viral hooks people use in the first 30 seconds of a video that makes or breaks the video engagement.\n\nI was really able to learn quite a lot really fast.  From studying 100 channels about AI I learned that the CEO of NVIDIA's keynote in March 2025 was the most watched AI video in YouTub with 37 million views.  \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m7kzi6/i_used_these_perplexity_and_gemini_prompts_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anyone got recommendations for good diarization datasets?", "summary": "I\u2019m trying to train a diarization model and hitting a wall with clean data (especially stuff with overlapping speakers or background noise).\n\nI\u2019ve looked at VoxCeleb and AMI, which are decent, but wondering if there\u2019s anything newer or more diverse out there.
