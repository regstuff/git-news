If you need to ask me questions, ask one question at a time, so that by you asking and me replying, you will be able to produce the most reliable fact-check of the provided text. Here are the steps you should follow: 1. Source Evaluation: Identify the primary source of the information in the text (e.g., author, speaker, publication, or website). Assess the credibility of this source based on the following: - Expertise: Is the source an expert or authority on the subject? - Past Reliability: Has the source demonstrated accuracy or consistency in past claims? - Potential Bias: Does the source have any noticeable biases that could affect the reliability of the information presented? 2. Cross-Referencing: Cross-reference the claims made in the text with reputable and trustworthy external sources. - Look for corroboration: Are other authoritative sources, publications, or experts supporting the claims made in the text? - Identify discrepancies: If there are any inconsistencies or contradictions between the text and trusted sources, please highlight them. 3. Rating System: Provide a rating for the overall reliability of the text, based on the information provided. Use the following categories: - True: The claims in the text are supported by credible sources and factual evidence. - Minor Errors: There are small inaccuracies or omissions that do not significantly affect the overall message. - Needs Double-Checking: The information provided is unclear or may be misleading. Further verification is needed for key claims. - False: The claims in the text are incorrect, misleading, or entirely unsupported by credible sources. 4.

Are there any nuances, qualifiers, or details that might be missing, which could affect the interpretation of the information? If there is a subtle misrepresentation or missing context, please describe the impact it has on the accuracy of the claims. 5. Timeliness Check: Assess whether the claims are based on outdated information. - Is the information current?: Are there recent developments or changes that have not been accounted for? - If the information is outdated, indicate how this affects the validity of the text\u2019s claims. 6. Final Summary: Provide a brief summary of your fact-checking analysis: - Highlight any key errors or issues found in the text. - Suggest additional sources or strategies for the user to verify the text further, if applicable. - Provide your overall judgment on whether the text is reliable, needs further scrutiny, or should be dismissed as false.*\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your interest and feedback.

For my masters project there is a section where i need to create synthetic medical discharge notes. For that i chose gemma3 4b model because it can run locally on 6gb vram machine and 128k context window. My instruction is \"create a discharge note with diabetes, hypertension,  kidney disease\" (simplified) and output is a full discharge note from hospital. \n\nSome numbers : \n\nTraining dataset in hugging face format - 40k\nValidation - 5k\nTest - 5k\n\nWith gemma4 tokeniser - \nMax token for instruction 600\nAverage 300\n\nMax token for output 13300\nAverage 4000\n\nSo i used unsloth notebook and used it on a cloud vm with 40gb a100 vram. \n\n14000 &gt;(13300+ 600) context window is minimum. No compromise during training. \n\nMy goal : to finetune it enough so it understands the discharge note template or structure or tonality, narrative etc in a good way. When gemini generates discharge note its very robotic and not human doctor like. \n\nDuring inference i will use 128k context and use 70k token instructions with detailed disease description. \n\nChallenges i am facing : \n1. First time fine tuning. I have no idea what i am doing or even if it will work. Need guidance.\n\n2. How can i finetune it with almost minimum money. Google colab + pro tpu ?? H100 vs a100 ?? Etc. I was using 10000 rupees free credit on ola krutrim which is a garbage cloud solution. I have spent 3 accounts of google 300$ credit last month. And azure 200$ student subscription doesn't let me create vm with gpu. \n\n3. I want to stick to gemma3, but can you help me also with the best hyper parameters for the vm that is available to me on ola krutrim randomly - 40gb vram a100 ? Like batch size and all of the hyperparam of SFTT trainer class. \n\n\nI am using the same parameters as - \n\n\nNothing i have changed regarding the process and hyper parameters.
