This comes from an upcoming book by Dr. Emily Hauser titled Mythica: A New History of Homer\u2019s World, Through the Women Written Out Of It. In an Instagram post Dr. Hauser writes \"Meanwhile artwork that gives us depictions of women in the ancient world is by men &amp; for the male gaze, depicting stereotyped (and almost always fantasy) women. And then, when that artwork DOES seem to depict real women, it's typically been assigned to men; take the example of an electrum death mask, buried near a female and male skeleton in Late Bronze Age Mycenae, that is typically assigned to the man: which researchers now think actually belonged to her.\" In the same grave there have been found swords, which she thinks also belonged to her which according to her might prove that women had roles in warfare.\n\nHowever when a comment asked her about the image of the original mask she didn't post a link or anything, just said that it's in the Athens museum. I tried to find images of this and all of the deaths masks that show up from the museum are of this photo here. So far no one has found a female with a death mask so I'm very curious how does she arrive at the conclusion that one of these masks belonged to the lady. Another thing that is a bit sketchy that I noticed is that the \"artist\" that she asked to re-crated this image mostly has AI generated images on their instagram profile and it's this one:imperiumromanum\\_27ac . Also I can't find images (and she hasn't posted) of the bones of the woman which would be interesting to look at.  Does anyone have more information about this grave and find because I really love looking at ancient faces and love when people try to re-created them with modern tools so we can peer back to ancient times.
