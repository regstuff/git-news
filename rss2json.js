The publication venue for system descriptions will be the proceedings of the CL4Health workshop, also co-published in the ACL anthology.\n\n== TASK DESCRIPTION ==  \nHealthcare CQA forums provide diverse user perspectives, from personal experiences to factual advice and suggestions. However, traditional summarization approaches often overlook this richness by focusing on a single best-voted answer. The PerAnsSumm shared task seeks to address this gap with two main challenges:\n\n\\* Task A: Identifying and classifying perspective-specific spans in CQA answers.  \n\\* Task B: Generating structured, perspective-specific summaries for the entire question-answer thread.\n\nThis task aims to build tools that provide users with concise summaries catering to varied informational needs.\n\n== DATA ==  \nParticipants will be provided with:  \n\\* Training and validation datasets, accessible via CodaBench.  \n\\* A separate test set for evaluation. (Unseen)  \nA starter code is also available to make it easier for participants to get started.\n\n== EVALUATION ==  \nSystem submissions will be evaluated based on automatic metrics, with a focus on the accuracy and relevance of the summaries.
