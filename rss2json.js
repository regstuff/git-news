I've been thinking about how to make my life easier by automating some of the grunt work, especially when I'm writing articles and video scripts.\n\nSo here's what I'm trying to do:\n\n1. Generate relevant phrases based on my content\n\n2. Take these phrases and find phonetically similar variations\n\n3. Filter out the ones that don't make sense\n\nLet's use this post as an example:\n\nStep 1 would generate phrases like \"fun and games\"\n\nStep 2 would give me variations like \"pun and games\" or \"gun and games\"\n\nStep 3 would keep \"pun and games\" but toss out \"gun and games\" because this post isn't about guns\n\nI tried [using large language models to automate steps 1-3]( end-to-end, but it just didn't work as well as I hoped. These models don't explore enough options to find good puns, and they burn through a lot of tokens.\n\nLarge language models are great at step 1 (coming up with phrases) and step 3 (filtering for meaning), but step 2 (finding and replacing words based on sound) needs a more systematic, combinatorial approach.\n\nWhat I need is a tool that can handle step 2. It should:\n\n2.1. Take phrases I give it\n\n2.2. Find words that sound alike and swap them in\n\n2.3. Sort them by how close they sound to the original\n\nI've tried  [Rhymezone]( and [Pun Generator]( but they only work with one word at a time. I need something that can handle whole phrases and give me similar-sounding variations.\n\nDoes something like this exist? I'd also love to hear possible ways to build something like this or if there's a better approach I haven't thought of.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ir9v7c/looking_for_a_tool_that_generates_phonetically/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel's Netanyahu signals he's moving ahead with idea to transfer Palestinians from Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-02-15-2025-1cf8b3cb7622489c368c610f85e51e35", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Special Forces blocked 2,000 credible asylum claims from Afghan commandos, MoD confirms", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9l9elr95zo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Note-Taking App Open Source | Only - JS HTML CSS", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/orayemre/Notemod", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Excellent Article:  Ribeiro, A. &amp; Giamakis, C.
