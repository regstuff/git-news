Dude makes amazing stuff so I'm sure most of you have watched him as well. He mentioned using this with Docker and I had always steered clear of Docker since I could never get it installed on my machine. Then I learned about Gemini CLI.\n\nGemini CLI is great for about 1 hour, then it heavily limits itself. But, I was able to get Gemini CLI to install Docker for me and make a container with Open Webui, all with one command. Then I watched as it happened. Finally, I was able to have Docker and a setup that mimics ChatGPT sorta, imo. \n\nNow, I love it. I spent all night learning how to get models into Open Webui, customizing the interface some (still having issues here), and getting it to work for assistant, chat, music, and work needs, in that order of prioritization. Ha. So, being able to use this, technically, as a 1-click install, is possible. Getting it going the way you need does require some digging but I enjoy that part. \n\nOne thing that is bugging me is the lack of resources I can find for customizing it. I don't want to do much to it, but I have some personal visual issues that needs some assistance. I would like to figure out how the fonts can be changed, the color of the font can be changed, and change the color of the backgrounds. I see that it appears to be possible to do so. But I can't seem to figure out where and I don't see it in the admin interface or settings. If anyone can please point me in the right direction to figure this out that would be great. Seriously.

My Thoughts..", "summary": "Basically it's a step above 'prompt engineering ' \n\nThe prompt is for the moment, the specific input. \n\n'Context engineering' is setting up for the moment. \n\nThink about it as building a movie - the background, the details etc. That would be the context framing. The prompt would be when the actors come in and say their one line. \n\nSame thing for context engineering. You're building the set for the LLM to come in and say they're one line. \n\nThis is a lot more detailed way of framing the LLM over saying \"Act as a Meta Prompt Master and develop a badass prompt....\" \n\nYou have to understand Linguistics Programming (I wrote an article on it, link in bio)\n\nSince English is the new coding language, users have to understand Linguistics a little more than the average bear. \n\nThe Linguistics Compression is the important aspect of this \"Context Engineering\" to save tokens so your context frame doesn't fill up the entire context window. \n\nIf you do not use your word choices correctly, you can easily fill up a context window and not get the results you're looking for. Linguistics compression reduces the amount of tokens while maintaining maximum information Density. \n\nAnd that's why I say it's a step above prompt engineering. I create digital notebooks for my prompts. Now I have a name for them - Context Engineering Notebooks... \n\nAs an example, I have a digital writing notebook that has seven or eight tabs, and 20 pages in a Google document. Most of the pages are samples of my writing, I have a tab dedicated to resources, best practices, etc. this writing notebook serve as a context notebook for the LLM in terms of producing an output similar to my writing style. So I've created an environment a resources for the llm to pull from. The result is an output that's probably 80% my style, my tone, my specific word choices, etc.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lnsprm/what_is_this_context_engineering_everyone_is/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "IAF lost some jets due to no-strike orders on Pakistan's defences, says official; govt says remarks taken 'out of context'", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/iaf-lost-some-jets-due-to-no-strike-orders-on-pakistans-defences-says-official-govt-says-remarks-taken-out-of-context/articleshow/122150319.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Alexandrie app", "summary": "Hi everyone!  \nI\u2019d like to share a project I\u2019ve been working on for a few years now: **Alexandrie**.\n\nIt\u2019s a web-based note-taking app, designed especially for **students**, but also useful for **developers**, **creators**, and more.  \nThe goal is to have a clean, beautiful interface and nicely formatted documents **without the hassle** you get with tools like Word.  \nYou can easily manage hundreds of documents, export them, and boost your productivity thanks to **snippets** and **shortcuts** that let you write super fast.\n\nAs for the tech stack, it\u2019s built with **Vue.js/Nuxt** on the frontend and **Go** for the backend, with a small **MinIO** server to handle file storage.  \nIt\u2019s a web app, but it\u2019s also installable as a **PWA** with **offline mode** (coming very soon \u2014 I\u2019m just finishing up some testing).\n\nI\u2019m currently working on it solo, but if anyone wants to contribute \u2014 whether it\u2019s with ideas, feedback, advice, or even code \u2014 I\u2019d absolutely love that.  \nIt\u2019s the **first real project** I\u2019ve hosted seriously, and I\u2019m super excited to see where it goes.\n\n  \n**GitHub**: [  \nIf you like the project, feel free to leave a \u2b50 \u2014 it helps bring in more contributors and keep improving the app!", "link": "https://github.com/Smaug6739/Alexandrie", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018India must avoid seeing the world through the lens of Trump\u2019: Shivshankar Menon", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/2025/06/28/india-must-avoid-seeing-the-world-through-the-lens-of-trump-shivshankar-menon.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China rolls over $3.4 billion of commercial loans to Pakistan, says source | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-rolls-over-34-billion-commercial-loans-pakistan-says-source-2025-06-29/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trash my presentation on NLP and get paid for it", "summary": "Hi all, I have to give a presentation (60 min) on topic modelling and further text analysis using NLP methods.

[READ FOR DETAILS]", "summary": "Ever since I started using ChatGPT back when it first came out (before teachers knew what it was or had checkers for it), I've had the opportunity to experiment and learn the \"art\" of prompt writing--because it really is an art of its own. LLMs are great, but the hard truth is that they're often only as good as the person prompting it. A shit prompt will get shit results, and a beautifully crafted prompt will beget a beautifully crafted response (...most of the time).\n\nLately I've been seeing a lot of posts about the \"best prompt\" for \\[insert topic\\]. Those posts are great, and I do enjoy reading them. But I think a GPT that already knows how to do that for any prompt you feed it would be great. Perhaps it already exists and I'm just trying to reinvent the wheel, but I want to give a shot at creating one. Ideally, it would create prompts just as clear, comprehensive, and fool-proof as the highly engineered prompts that I see on here (without having to wait for someone who is better at prompt writing to post about it).\n\nFor context on my personal use, I use ChatGPT to help me write prompts for itself as well as GeminiAI (mainly for deep research) and NotebookLM (analyzing the reports for GeminiAI as well as other study materials). The only problem is that it's a hassle to go through the process of explaining to ChatGPT what it's duty is in that specific context, write my own first draft, etc. It'd be great to have a GPT that already knows it's duty in great length, as well as how to get it done in the most efficient and effective way possible.\n\nI could have brainstormed on my own and spent a ton of time thinking about what this GPT would need and what qualities it would have... but I think it's much smarter (and more efficient) to consult the entire community of fellow ChatGPT users. More specifically, this is what I'm looking for:\n\n1. Knowledge that I can upload to it as a file (external sources/documents that more comprehensively explain the method of engineering prompts and other such materials)\n2. What I would include in its instruction set\n3. Possible actions to create (don't know if this is necessary, but I expect there are people here far more creative than me lmao)\n4. Literally anything else that would be useful\n\nWould love to hear thoughts on any or all of these from the community!\n\nI totally don't mind (and will,\u00a0*if*\u00a0this post gets traction) putting the GPT out to the public so we can all utilize it!
