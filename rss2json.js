Say DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, even the new GPT-OSS model does not have Vision. For all OpenWebUI users using these models as daily drivers, and the people who use external APIs like OpenRouter, Groq, and Sambanova, I present to you the most seamingless way to add vision capabilities to your favorite base model.\n\nHere it is: [External Vision Layer Function](\n\nNote: even VLMs are supported.\n\n# Features:\n\n1. This filter implements an asynchronous image-to-text transcriber system using Google's Gemini API (v1beta).\n   * You are permitted to modify code to utilize different models.\n2. Supports both single and batch image processing.\n   * Meaning one or multiple images per query will be batched as one request\n3. Includes a retry mechanism, per-image caching to avoid redundant processing.\n   * Cached images are entirely skipped from further analysis to Gemini.\n4. Images are fetched via aiohttp, encoded in base64, and submitted to Gemini\u2019s generate_content endpoint using inline_data.\n5. Generated content from VLM (in this case Gemini) will replace the image URL as context for non-vlm base model.\n   * VLM base model also works because the base model will not even see the images, completely stripped from chat.\n   * API's such as OpenRouter, Groq, and Sambanova API models are tested to function.\n6. The base model knows the order the images were sent, and will receive the images in this format:\n\nxml\n&lt;image 1&gt;[detailed transcription of first image]&lt;/image&gt;\n&lt;image 2&gt;[detailed transcription of second image]&lt;/image&gt;\n&lt;image 3&gt;[detailed transcription of third image]&lt;/image&gt;\n\n\n7. Currently hardcoded to limit max 3 images sent per query.

The thought of uploading sensitive documents\u2014contracts, resumes, financial statements\u2014to some random company's server is a privacy nightmare. Who owns it? How long are my files stored? Are they secure? I didn't want to take that risk.\n\nSo, I decided to build my own solution:\u00a0**Every PDF**.\n\nIt's a completely free, open-source desktop application that does all its work\u00a0**100% locally on your machine**. Your files never touch the internet. No ads, no subscriptions, no data collection.\n\nWhat started as a simple tool to merge and split files has grown into something much more powerful, thanks to amazing feedback from the community. The latest version now includes a\u00a0**full PDF editor**.\n\nHere's what Every PDF can do:\n\n* \u270d\ufe0f\u00a0**Edit &amp; Add Text**: Fill out forms or add annotations anywhere on a page.\n* \u2712\ufe0f\u00a0**Add Signatures**: Draw your signature or upload an image to sign documents digitally.\n* \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u00a0**Add Images**: Easily insert logos, stamps, or other graphics.\n* \u2705\u00a0**Add Checkmarks**: Quickly mark up forms and lists.\n* \ud83d\udd87\ufe0f\u00a0**Merge &amp; Split**: Combine multiple PDFs, or split them by page range.\n* \ud83d\udca7\u00a0**Watermark**: Protect your documents with text or image watermarks.\n* \ud83d\udd04\u00a0**Rotate &amp; Reorder**: Quickly fix page orientation and order.\n\nThis is a one-person project, built with Nextron (Next.js + Electron) and Python. It's my answer to a problem I think many of us face. I'm not a big company, just a developer who wanted a better, more private tool.\n\nI would love for you to try it out and let me know what you think.
