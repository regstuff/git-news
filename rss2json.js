Now, that we are no longer in control of Dhaka ,we are out of picture as we lost our biggest influence .Either US or China are responsible for regime change .Now ,there won't be any election Ig so military will be in power or puppet PM would be installed to fool the population the state would either swing between US or China depending upon the general sentiments and US got what it wants if China gets a strong hold of Dhaka then India has no option but to go closer towards US thus breaking its status quo, US I personally think won't be able consolidate its influence on Dhaka as Military tends to be tilting towards China .The other most bizarre theory is US consolidates its influence on Dhaka which would led US countering India and China at the same time which is highly unlikely. I wouldn't be surprised if US joined hands with China for the regime change as it would serve the purpose of reducing India's influence in the region and serving both for their interests where they could be two big bullies in the region fighting with each other over global influence .\n\n  \nPS:- I see many over here are outright denying my arguments by calling it a conspiracy theory but time shall be the witness when we watch the foreign policy of BD shift causing troubles for us, I hope, I and several others like me be proven wrong let's see.

Before the elections, the US made an offer to Sheikh Hasina requesting permission to set up US military bases in Bangladesh in exchange for support to her party, which she refused. \n\nAlso, in Pakistan, former PM Imran Khan alleged that the US conspired with the ISI to remove him from power as he was building a close relationship with China.\n\nLastly, there were allegations in the 1980s that the Khalistani movement in India was initially funded by the CIA through the ISI, but later on, after Indira Gandhi's assasination they distanced themselves.\n\n\nIs US the cause of all instability in South East Asia?\n\nEdit: Yes, it is true she handled the protests naively. But my question is, did foreign state actors take advantage of the situation and fan the flame, which led to Hasina's resignation and military rule in Bangladesh ?\n\nEdit 2 : Please refrain from inciting communal hatred in the comments sections.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ekl3ya/political_turmoil_in_bangladesh/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Google violated antitrust law to maintain search monopoly, judge rules", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/google-antitrust-lawsuit-monopoly", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Artistic swimming due to kick off in Paris \u2013 without any men", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Artistic swimming due to kick off in Paris \u2013 without any men</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPMHZmOGJpRExidWJsQzFhLUFtd0pZNHljRU12V2dLbHE0TkNSdHFXS2JUc2otNHZ1MHJBTXdBemFUdVNkRzlvVTlGTjg0T2FzUFRpSnMxczFQWlZPOXl0cEYtX1FzWE5qOWtOa2d6bkIxenUwVEhnbzFSUVY0SkVNNXBwaWR1YzZhbmZzakQ1cW00U0ZXa0o5Z25pdzA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-05", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Palestinian Olympic swimmer Valerie Tarazi is living a personal dream, fighting for her homeland through sport", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Palestinian Olympic swimmer Valerie Tarazi is living a personal dream, fighting for her homeland through sport</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNeUlJQUItSWdYbExNcFpZT19KQm9YZ1ptWmQxTms2NnhPVkRxRnVQMENXSWZmdTlwQllqNmVmeDQ0blpUMjR5dWN6bTJtdkFiQkViRE1HX2xXc1V1aTBPdWIycHNmVTVxdmk4TkFMRm1VdGVRRnpqZ0Z1V0hHY1ZuazlEOVhqZlpGZjdqQ2dnM3B1Zw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-05", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany wins dramatic gold medal after controversial mixed relay triathlon went ahead in River Seine", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Germany wins dramatic gold medal after controversial mixed relay triathlon went ahead in River Seine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNdzBFV0Q0TGR3NnY1R2tkMXgwaHYwd0JlZWw2YjdoNnJpNjFPOXBZY2NIWnZtamZHN2lYeHRGY1FFWU1aNW5SUXFxRG5OVGRoV3FOS3UzSmxzSF8zUXVjanpETHJOU25hNWMzSlFWbHFiZTM1MThVVVNSLWhMN1BrLUFjSHRnZkFHaUFSd1pxUWtxVDJHand6T0U0Y0JWYmM?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-05", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The latest on the Paris Olympics", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">The latest on the Paris Olympics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQZzl1OG13aDdib24yY3E2NnFjNkRyMW9oUFFoMnUxMTNJX0RxNXo0d2ZNaFB4UDBlVFhFUFdsaGE0dmgxaHpvamRXWFBZZnRYajZCVGFoalJSSjhLM05qUGZyQXBrS29WYXhrcmFRVzhHUFpiLVJGMUwzSy1ELW5TXzMzak44eWY3?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-05", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Simone Biles slips off the balance beam and fails to win gold for the first time in Paris", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Simone Biles slips off the balance beam and fails to win gold for the first time in Paris</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRkhXSzdRY0JiWThBY3NpMUpHVmlqWVZSRFNKOUtuNVIzeVYwQjd4Q1pBWFVuWTVabXlFTlBiQW9SbFB1TEJ2SU1YazZKS3dxQjVZeVZVRVdfQk9OVWxXTmNBU2ZDZEZWU1gtMW9jNHMzUWdPM2RIZUo5ZllBSDhOT1NlQm5yMDhWS2cyZTR6MnBuWW5i0gGGAUFVX3lxTE9Xa3RGVWl3WEFheGM4VzctcXZjamR4eWRjekVsdmdVeVA5TmtkVVVyU2xEdmNWbERsTV9LOWl5Zk1XelRjelhVQ1BwYV81QXZQdlBEdm1mcm1ST0JBcDIxY2NLbEZlNjdzOEdrLWhUVFFKQWxiYUIyVXdpZHhlaDI2UVc0OV9n?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-05", "author": "None"}]}}};
