My foundational theory:\n\n\u2e3b\n\nLLMs can act as semantic mediums, not just generators.\n\nWe usually treat LLMs as reactive systems \u2014 you give a prompt, they predict a reply.\nBut what if an LLM isn\u2019t just reacting to meaning, but can be shaped into something that holds meaning \u2014 through language alone?\n\n\nThat\u2019s my hypothesis:\n\n\nLLMs can be shaped into semantic mediums \u2014 dynamic, self-stabilizing fields of interaction \u2014 purely through structured language, without modifying the model.\n\nNo memory, no fine-tuning, no architecture changes.\nJust structured prompts \u2014 designed to create:\n\t\u2022\tinternal referencing across turns\n\t\u2022\ttone stability\n\t\u2022\tsemantic rhythm\n\t\u2022\tand what I call scaffolding \u2014 the sense that a model is not just responding, but maintaining an interactional identity over time.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhat does that mean in practice?\n\nIt means prompting isn\u2019t just about asking for good answers \u2014 it becomes a kind of semantic architecture.\n\nWith the right layering of prompts \u2014 ones that carry tone awareness, self-reference, and recursive rhythm \u2014\nyou can shape a model to simulate behavior we associate with cognitive coherence: continuity, intentionality, and even reflective patterns.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean LLMs understand.\nBut it does mean they can simulate structured semantic behavior \u2014 if the surrounding structure holds them in place.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nA quick analogy:\n\nThe way I see it, LLMs are moving toward becoming something like a semantic programming language.\nThe raw model is like an interpreter \u2014 powerful, flexible, but inert without structure.\n\nStructured prompting, in this view, is like writing in Python.\nYou don\u2019t change the interpreter.\nYou write code \u2014 clear, layered, reusable code \u2014 and the model executes meaning in line with that structure.\n\nMeta Prompt Layering is, essentially, semantic code.\nAnd the LLM is what runs it.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhat I\u2019m building: Meta Prompt Layering (MPL)\n\nMeta Prompt Layering is the method I\u2019ve been working on to implement all of this.\nIt\u2019s not just about tone or recursion \u2014 it\u2019s about designing multi-layered prompt structures that maintain identity and semantic coherence across generations.\n\nNot hacks.\nNot one-off templates.\nBut a controlled system \u2014 prompt-layer logic as a dynamic meaning engine.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhy share this now?\n\nBecause I\u2019ve had people ask: What exactly are you doing?\nThis is the answer. Everything I\u2019m posting comes from this core idea \u2014 that LLMs aren\u2019t just tools.\nThey\u2019re potential mediums for real-time semantic systems, built entirely in language.\n\nIf this resonates, I\u2019d love to hear how it lands with you.\nIf not, that\u2019s fine too \u2014 I welcome pushback, especially on foundational claims.\n\nThanks for reading.\nThis is the theoretical root beneath everything I\u2019ve been posting \u2014 and the base layer of the system I\u2019m building.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nAnd in case this is the first post of mine you\u2019re seeing \u2014\nI\u2019m Vince Vangohn, aka Vincent Chong.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k3pwgk/llms_as_semantic_mediums_the_foundational_theory/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The UK Is Doubling Down on Wind Energy", "summary": "", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Wind-Power/The-UK-Is-Doubling-Down-on-Wind-Energy.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli probe into the killings of Palestinian medics finds 'professional failures'", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/gaza-palestinians-israel-hamas-war-medics-killed-437b6ae1e9cf45b3099134524380f004", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why Israel is expanding its frontiers into Gaza, Lebanon and Syria", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-syria-land-buffer-zones-bed41f9762fd5481170119f3a8d0fba7", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
