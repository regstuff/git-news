", "summary": "Hi everyone - for the last couple of months I\u2019ve been applying to a bunch of CRM firms in my area. The response times were very slow. I was getting nervous and sent out my CV everywhere and networked as much as I could. Im a newbie and was nervous about getting no work at all. \n\nFinally, I got a job offer from a company. The pay is good and I\u2019m happy with it. Still onboarding so don\u2019t know the full load of work I\u2019ll be getting in the field yet.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been suddenly hearing back from a handful of companies. Seven total companies so far with on call and project based work; and I expect more. \n\nMy understanding is that on call field techs usually have a few companies that they\u2019re employed by for more frequent work. But how many is too many? I would feel guilty if im constantly denying some of the companies. \n\nTLDR: How many CRM firms should I be involved with? What is too many? Will being involved with too many companies result in a bad reputation or is this normal in the Field Tech game?
