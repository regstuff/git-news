Now, I want to dive deeper into the generative AI and NLP domains, staying up-to-date with current research trends. I have around 250 days to dedicate to this journey and can consistently spend 1 hour per day reading research papers, journals, and news.\n\nI'm seeking guidance on two main fronts:\n\nEssential Prerequisites and Foundational Papers: What are the must-read papers or resources from the past that would help me build a strong foundation in generative AI and NLP?\n\nSelecting Current Papers: How do I go about choosing which current research papers to focus on? Are there specific conferences, journals, or sources you recommend following? How can I evaluate whether a paper is worth my time, especially with my goal of being able to critically assess and compare new research against SOTA (State of the Art) models?\n\nMy long-term goal is to pursue a generalist AI role. I don\u2019t have a particular niche in mind yet\u2014I\u2019d like to first build a broad understanding of the field. Ultimately, I want to be able to not only grasp the key ideas behind prominent models, papers, and trends but also confidently provide insights and opinions when reviewing random research papers.\n\nI understand there's no single \"right\" approach, but without proper guidance, it feels overwhelming. Any advice, structured learning paths, or resource recommendations would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!
