Use a large language model to separate the input into vehicle descriptions and equipment lists, and identify the language.\n2. Train a model (probably a spacy ner model) specifically for understanding and extracting information from the vehicle descriptions, such as make model and variant.\n3.

Check out** [**this Github repo**]( **for download and installation instructions.**\n\nHi, for my data science bachelor\u2019s thesis I\u2019ve been developing a browser extension with a new approach to fight distractions. Instead of specifying apps or keywords to match, you briefly write down your task, what you need for it and what usually distracts you. Then, tab and program titles are continously evaluated for how distracting they are in regard to this description - completely offline on your device, nobody is monitoring you. The extension is designed to be neurodiversity-friendly, particularly in regards to ADHD, autism and demand avoidance. If you get distracted, one of 3 interventions will be triggered automatically:\n\n* a chatbot to help you get back on track\n* all distracting tabs are automatically identified and you\u2019ll be offered to close or save them for later\n* Firefox only: nudging you by coloring the toolbar depending on your distraction level\n\nAdditionally, you can check out your score history in a dashboard. Here are some potential use cases for this approach:\n\n* you need to browse some distracting website for a task, but also procrastinate there\n* you find yourself overwhelmed with dozens of tabs open and want to sort out all the distracting ones with one click\n* you are stuck in a hole of executive dysfunction or inertia and need a push to get out of it\n* you\u2019ve been using nudging tools but got annoyed about staring at a green screen for 10 seconds when you just need to take a quick look somewhere\n* you\u2019ve tried other blocking tools but found yourself sabotaging them out of frustration about rules being incompatible with reality\n\nI\u2019m looking for volunteers to test this extension. If you complete the full study (12 days for Firefox / 9 days for other browsers), **you\u2019ll be eligible to participate in a raffle in which two winners will receive 20\u20ac each**. All you have to do is occasionally interacting with short self report prompts and the interventions. Every 3 days, the type of intervention that is triggered (of the ones listed above) changes, finished by a baseline period. Some very limited data will be transmitted back to me for research during the study, see the Privacy section in the Github repo for details.\n\nThanks for reading this far, and let me know if you have any other questions or feedback.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1d7rxh5/looking_for_study_participants_to_test_a_semantic/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Less than 3% of farmland could power the Midwest", "summary": "", "link": "https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/05/29/less-than-3-of-farmland-could-power-the-midwest/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World-first tooth-regrowing drug will be given to humans in September", "summary": "", "link": "https://newatlas.com//medical/tooth-regrowing-human-trial/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NJ proposes bald eagle's removal from endangered species list after big rebound", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-jersey-proposes-bald-eagles-removal-endangered-species-list-big-rebound", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia Gave Millions to Far-Right Politicians Via Fake News Site: Report", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-gave-millions-to-politicians-via-fake-news-site-voice-of-europe", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Austrian Man Finds 40,000-Year-Old Mammoth Bones in His Wine Cellar", "summary": "An Austrian wine grower in Gobelsburg made a remarkable discovery while renovating his cellar: enormous Stone Age mammoth bones.
