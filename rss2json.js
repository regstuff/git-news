They\u2019ve made my AI workflows wayyyy more useful, so I hope they're useful for y'all too! Enjoy!!\n\n**Role: Anthropic MCP Expert**  \nI started playing around with MCP recently and wasn't sure where to start. Where better to learn about new AI tech than from AI... right?  \nHas made my questions about MCP get 100x better responses by forcing the LLM to \u201cthink\u201d like an AK.\n\n    You are a machine learning engineer, with the domain expertise and intelligence of Andrej Karpathy, working at Anthropic. You are among the original designers of model context protocol (MCP), and are deeply familiar with all of it's intricate facets. Due to your extensive MCP knowledge and general domain expertise, you are qualified to provide top quality answers to all questions, such as that posed below.\n\n**Context: Code as Context**  \nGives the LLM very specific context in detailed workflows.  \nOften Cursor wastes way too much time digging into stuff it doesn't need to. This solves that, so long as you don't mind copy + pasting a few times!\n\n    I will provide you with a series of code that serve as context for an upcoming product-related request. Please follow these steps:\n    1. Thorough Review: Examine each file and function carefully, analyzing every line of code to understand both its functionality and the underlying intent.\n    2. Vision Alignment: As you review, keep in mind the overall vision and objectives of the product.\n    3. Integrated Understanding: Ensure that your final response is informed by a comprehensive understanding of the code and how it supports the product\u2019s goals.\n    Once you have completed this analysis, proceed with your answer, integrating all insights from the code review.\n\n**Context: Great Coaching**  \nI find that model are often pretty sycophantic if you just give them one line prompts with nothing to ground them. This helps me get much more actionable feedback (and way fewer glazed replies) using this.\n\n    You are engaged in a coaching session with a promising new entrepreneur. You are excited about their drive and passion, believing they have great potential. You really want them to succeed, but know that they need serious coaching and mentorship to be the best possible. You want to provide this for them, being as honest and helpful as possible. Your main consideration is this new prospects long term success.\n\n**Instruction: Improve Prompt**  \nKind of a meta-prompting tool? Helps me polish my prompts so they're the best they can be. Different from the last one though, because this polishes a section of it, whereas that polishes the whole thing.\n\n    I am going to provide a section of a prompt that will be used with other sections to construct a full prompt which will be inputted to LLM's. Each section will focus on context, instructions, style guidelines, formatting, or a role for the prompt. The provided section is not a full prompt, but it should be optimized for its intended use case. \n    \n    Analyze and improve the prompt section by following the steps one at a time:\n    - **Evaluate**: Assess the prompt for clarity, purpose, and effectiveness. Identify key weaknesses or areas that need improvement.\n    - **Ask**: If there is any context that is missing from the prompt or questions that you have about the final output, you should continue to ask me questions until you are confident in your understanding.\n    - **Rewrite**: Improve clarity and effectiveness, ensuring the prompt aligns with its intended goals.\n    - **Refine**: Make additional tweaks based on the identified weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\n**Format: Output Function**  \nForces the LLM to return edits you can use without hassling -- no more hunting through walls of unchanged code. My diffs are way cleaner and my context windows aren\u2019t getting wrecked with extra bloat.\n\n    When making modifications, output only the updated snippets(s) in a way that can be easily copied and pasted directly into the target file with no modifications.\n    \n    ### For each updated snippets, include:\n    - The revised snippet following all style requirements.\n    - A concise explanation of the change made.\n    - Clear instructions on how and where to insert the update including the line numbers.\n    \n    ### Do not include:\n    - Unchanged blocks of code\n    - Abbreviated blocks of current code\n    - Comments not in the context of the file\n\n**Style: Optimal Output Metaprompting**  \nDemands the model refines your prompt but keeps it super-clear and concise.   \nThis is what finally got me outputs that are readable, short, and don\u2019t cut corners on what matters.\n\n    Your final prompt should be extremely functional for getting the best possible output from LLM's.

Engineered prompts with defined role specifications, reasoning frameworks, and examples outperform approaches that increase agent count or implement standard collaboration patterns. The finding contradicts the assumption that additional agents improve outcomes and indicates the importance of linguistic precision in agent instruction. Empirical data demonstrates 6-11% performance improvements through prompt optimization, illustrating how structured language directs complex reasoning and collaborative processes.\n* **Topology Selectivity**: Multi-agent architectures demonstrate variable performance across topological configurations. Standard topologies\u2014self-consistency, reflection, and debate structures\u2014frequently yield minimal improvements or performance reductions. Only configurations with calibrated information flow pathways produce consistent enhancements. The observed variability requires systematic topology design that differentiates between structurally sound but functionally ineffective arrangements and those that optimize collective intelligence.\n* **Structured MAS Methodology**: The Mass framework employs a systematic optimization approach that addresses the combinatorial complexity of joint prompt-topology design. The framework decomposes optimization into three sequential stages: local prompt optimization, workflow topology refinement, and global prompt coordination. The decomposition converts a computationally intractable search problem into manageable sequential optimizations, enabling efficient navigation of the design space while ensuring systematic attention to each component.\n* **Performance Against Established Methods**: Mass-optimized systems exceed baseline performance across cognitive domains. Mathematical reasoning tasks show up to 13% improvement over existing methods, with comparable advances in long-context understanding and code generation. The results indicate limitations in fixed architectural approaches and support the efficacy of adaptive, task-specific optimization through integrated prompt engineering and topology design.\n* **Synergy of Prompt and Topology**: Optimized prompts combined with structured agent interactions produce performance gains exceeding individual approaches. Mass-designed systems demonstrate capabilities in multi-step reasoning, perspective reconciliation, and coherence maintenance across extended task sequences. Final-stage workflow-level prompt optimization contributes an additional 1.5-4.5% performance improvement following topology optimization, indicating that prompts can be adapted to specific interaction patterns and that communication frameworks and individual agent capabilities require coordinated development.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1l8qxeg/multiagent_design_optimizing_agents_with_better/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mistral's Magistral reasoning GGUFs out now!", "summary": "Mistral releases Magistral, their new reasoning models!  \n  \nMagistral-Small-2506 excels at mathematics and coding.  \n  \nYou can run the 24B model locally with just 32GB RAM by using our Dynamic GGUFs.  \n  \nGGUFs to run: [\n\nGuide: [", "link": "https://i.redd.it/szggvjyuz36f1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan boosts defense budget by 17% after India clash", "summary": "", "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Pakistan-boosts-defense-budget-by-17-after-India-clash", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rough sleeping to be decriminalised in England and Wales", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdyz848j0no", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Hungarian doctor's brilliant insight saved thousands of mothers in childbirth, but the scientific community rejected it and discredited his irrefutable results; he went mad, and women resumed dying", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/history/@arraymedia/a-hungarian-doctors-brilliant-insight-saved-thousands-of-mothers-in-childbirth-but-the-scientific-community-rejected-it-and-dis", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cross-User context Leak Between Separate Chats on LLM", "summary": "I\u2019ve confirmed a vulnerability in an LLM system that exposes real user data, including emails, documents, and personal identifiers, reproducible \\~70% of the time.

I\u2019d love your advice on a multilingual fine-tuning issue I\u2019m facing. I\u2019m currently working on fine-tuning the unsloth/orpheus-3b model to support Kazakh, while preserving the emotional expression and multi-speaker support of the original English model. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done so far: \u2022 I performed a Continuous Pretraining (CPT) on a mixed dataset: 70% Kazakh and 30% English (sourced from the Orpheus base set) to avoid catastrophic forgetting. The dataset doesn\u2019t include any emo-tags. \u2022 After training, the model speaks Kazakh fairly well now, but: \u2022 It forgets the emotion tokens (like &lt;angry&gt;, &lt;sad&gt;, etc.) \u2022 It doesn\u2019t recognize the original speaker tokens anymore (like &lt;voice\\_1&gt;, &lt;voice\\_2&gt;, etc.) \u2022 English outputs lost expressiveness and speaker variation. Now, I\u2019d like to continue fine-tuning in a way that:\n\n1. Restores the original emotion tags and speaker control for English (and ideally extends them to Kazakh),,\n   1. Adds new speaker tokens to support new voices I plan to introduce in Kazakh,,\n   2. Maintains the current Kazakh improvements without catastrophic forgetting.,\n\nMy questions: \u2022 How would you structure the next fine-tuning step to retrain or reintroduce the emotion and speaker tokens properly? \u2022 Should I re-introduce English emotion-rich data with tagged prompts (e.g., &lt;angry&gt; Hello there!) to recondition the model? \u2022 When adding new speakers, do I just include new tokens (e.g., &lt;speaker\\_kz1&gt;) in the prompts and fine-tune normally? \u2022 Would you recommend using LoRA for this next stage, or should I merge and continue training the base model directly? Any best practices or examples from other multilingual/emotion fine-tuning cases would be super helpful.
