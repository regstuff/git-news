Bolsonaro also openly expressed admiration for Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship (1964-1985), which he claimed saved the country from communism.\n\nThree months before the election, Bolsonaro invited dozens of diplomats to the presidential palace for a nationally televised meeting in which he presented supposed vulnerabilities of the voting system, without providing any evidence. \n\nFollowing Bolsonaro\u2019s loss his party questioned results at the country\u2019s top electoral court but the claims were dismissed.\n\n###A draft decree to set the coup in motion\n\nIn January 2023, Brazilian police found a draft decree in the home of [Bolsonaro\u2019s former justice minister Anderson Torres]( It was one of many versions drafted either at the far-right leader\u2019s behest or with his knowledge, police say. The former president presented the document, unsigned, to the [commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces]( on Dec. 7, seeking their support. \n\nThe navy\u2019s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead.\n\n###Plan to assassinate the president-elect\n\nOn Nov. 19, Brazil\u2019s Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and [Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.]( The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro\u2019s ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say.\n\nGen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot\u2019s leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup.\n\n###Jan. 8 uprising\n\nFederal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the [Jan. 8, 2023 riot]( in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia. \n\n[The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office]( and their uprising \u2014 which came after Lula was sworn in \u2014 was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say.\n\nThe riot appears in the report as one of several \u201cother actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d\u2019etat.\u201d Police also say that Brig.
