Each model is profiled for cost and quality across benchmark tasks.\n2. Prompts are embedded and clustered by complexity and domain.\n3. The router picks the model minimizing expected error plus cost.\n4. New models are automatically benchmarked and added on the fly.\n\nNo manual evals, no retraining, no static routing logic.\n\n# Example use\n\n* Lightweight requests \u2192 gemini-flash tier models\n* Reasoning or debugging \u2192 claude-sonnet class models\n* Multi-step reasoning \u2192 gpt-5-level models\n\nAdaptive decides automatically in milliseconds.\n\n# Why it matters\n\nMost production LLM systems still hardcode model choices or run manual eval pipelines that don\u2019t scale.  \nAdaptive replaces that with live routing based on actual model behavior, letting you plug in new models instantly and optimize for cost in real time.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nAdaptive is a real-time router for multi-model LLM systems.  \nIt learns from live evals, adapts to new models automatically, and cuts inference costs by up to **90%** with almost no latency.\n\n**Drop it into your stack and stop picking models manually.**", "link": "https://github.com/Egham-7/adaptive", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Award-winning Wrexham Spaniel, abandoned five times, is now sniffing out wildlife crime", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14pll3pd70o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The 18-Year-Old German Soldier Who Died Saving Two Dutch Children", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/history/@arraymedia/the-18-year-old-german-soldier-who-died-saving-two-dutch-children", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Three neo-Nazis who plotted terrorist attacks on mosques and synagogues jailed | UK News", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/three-neo-nazis-who-plotted-terrorist-attacks-on-mosques-and-synagogues-jailed-13451058", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At the age of 90 Maryette McFarland just graduated from the Open University and has been receiving job offers!
