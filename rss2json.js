It could be a unique path to stand out.\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m afraid it might lean too heavily toward robotics and less on core NLP, and I worry I might not enjoy it.

After the USSR's fall, the story of Morozov's martyrdom was disproven, and people who actually knew him described him as a \"shithead\".", "summary": "TL:DR version\n\nHere's the story that was reported in the Soviet press at the time. Pavlik Morozov was a leader of his school's Young Pioneers group (Young Pioneers were basically the Soviet equivalent of the Hitler Youth). At the age of 13 Pavlik reported his father to the GPU (secret police). His father's supposed crime was frequently adjusted to fit whatever narrative the Soviet state wanted to push. His father was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor but that sentenced was later changed to death. Pavlik's snitching angered his family and on September 3, 1932 Pavlik and his younger brother were murdered by his uncle, grandfather, grandmother, and a cousin. All of his \"murderers\" were rounded up by the authorities and executed by firing squad. Pavlik was turned into a hero by Soviet propaganda and his story was used to encourage Eastern bloc children to snitch on their parents.\n\nHowever after the fall of the Soviet Union, Morozov's story was revisited and a very different picture emerged. For starters Pavlik was not a young pioneer and his father was actually chairman of the local soviet (not a kulak like Soviet propaganda had claimed).\n\nAs for why Pavlik informed on his father it's believed he was instigated by his mother. Pavlik's father had left the family and was living with his mistress. Pavlik's mother thought that the authorities would question her husband but let him go and he would be so scared he would leave his mistress and come back home. But that plan backfired when the Soviet authorities started instructing Pavlik to incriminate his father in court.\n\nThe evidence of Pavlik's family being involved in the murder is sketchy and it's now theorized that Pavlik was killed by some local teenagers because of a dispute over a gun. Pavlik's former neighbors mostly state that the right people were arrested for his murder. But they may be slightly biased as they don't want any blame directed at them or members of their families. One thing they all agree about is that the version of Pavlik created by Soviet  Propaganda couldn't have been more different from the real Pavlik who they described as a \"shithead\", who \"did nothing but cause trouble\".", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlik_Morozov", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ramesseum: Temple of Pharaoh Ramesses the Great", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/94rzgv4ao35f1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "do you think it's easier to make a living with online business or physical business?", "summary": "the reason online biz is tough is bc no matter which vertical you're in, you are competing with 100+ hyper-autistic 160IQ kids who do NOTHING but work  \n  \nit's pretty hard to compete without these hardcoded traits imo, hard but not impossible  \n  \nalmost everybody i talk to that has made a killing w/ online biz is drastically different to the average guy you'd meet irl  \n  \nthere are a handful of traits that i can't quite put my finger on atm, that are more prevalent in the successful ppl i've met  \n  \nit makes sense too, takes a certain type of person to sit in front of a laptop for 16 hours a day for months on end trying to make sh\\*t work", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1l3wu6q/do_you_think_its_easier_to_make_a_living_with/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "IndiGo to terminate Turkish Airlines lease deal by end of August after final extension", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-extends-indigos-turkish-airlines-lease-by-just-three-months-2025-05-30/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers \u2018overwhelmed\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Videos, eyewitnesses reportedly bolster claims IDF behind deadly fire on aid-seeking Gazans", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/videos-eyewitnesses-reportedly-bolster-claims-idf-behind-deadly-fire-on-aid-seeking-gazans/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "CocoIndex: Ultra performant real-time data transformation framework, written in Rust", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ms Rachel says she\u2019ll risk career to advocate for children in Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/ms-rachel-gaza-children", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Two data science-y questions", "summary": "\u2014 How do you avoid collinearity when training a language model?
