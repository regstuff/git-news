I say this as someone who learned the hard way.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the name Black Dahlia applies to a woman called Elizabeth Short. Elizabeth who was killed in Los Angeles in 1947. She was found on a sidewalk on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street in the neighborhood of Leimert Park in South Los Angeles.\n\nSo why shouldn\u2019t you look up her murder photos? Well because her body was left in an ~extraordinarily~ harrowing condition. More harrowing than your worse nightmares could ever stir up. Not only was Elizabeth dismembered, but she was dismembered in a highly unusual way. As if she was mutilated with surgical precision. But that\u2019s not the worst of it. Now is where I have the unique displeasure of making you aware of the word \u2018exsanguination.\u2019 \u2018Ex\u2019 coming from a word for \u2018out.\u2019 And the Latin word \u2018sanguination\u2019 having to do with blood. In short exsanguination is when somebody purposely drains somebody else\u2019s blood from their body. In Elizabeth\u2019s case, when her killer did so. That left Elizabeth\u2019s dissected torso with a color that almost seemed unhuman. In fact an early passerby first believed that her torso was a piece of a mannequin. Responding police also had the same hunch in the beginning.\n\nNow I will say that even though I don\u2019t think that anybody ought to look up her photos, that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t think that people should research her case. Quite the opposite. I urge members of the public to read what\u2019s been written and watch what\u2019s been made about what happened to Elizabeth. I think that especially because her killer was not found at the time and because there are several suspects including George Hodel, Elizabeth\u2019s case needs all the minds that it can get. Even all these years later. It\u2019s not too late to solve Elizabeth\u2019s killing, mutilation and exsanguination. And while unlikely, it\u2019s possible that her perpetrator is still living. I will link some sources below to get you started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1c7qlyk/the_killing_of_the_black_dahlia_los_angeless_most/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "West Asia crisis: Israel's inevitable retaliation against Iran has taken place, and India is caught in the crossfire", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/israel-iran-west-asia-middle-east-attack-13761231.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ICC considering issuing war crimes arrest warrants for Netanyahu, others", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.jpost.com/international/article-797820", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pleiasfr releases a massive open corpus of 2 million Youtube videos in Creative Commons (CC-By) on Huggingface", "summary": "", "link": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/PleIAs/YouTube-Commons", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trouble with cusim (CUDA-Word2Vec)", "summary": "I'm trying to use Cusim for an NLP-Project, but I have trouble getting it to run on an Sagemaker instance.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with that?\n\nI tried to modify the cuda\\_setup.py file ( [ ), in particular the following functions:\n\n    def get_cuda_sm_list(cuda_ver):\n      if \"CUDA_SM_LIST\" in os.environ:\n        sm_list = os.environ[\"CUDA_SM_LIST\"].split(\",\")\n      else:\n        sm_list = [\"30\", \"52\", \"60\", \"61\", \"70\", \"75\", \"80\", \"86\"]\n        if cuda_ver &gt;= 110:\n          filter_list = [\"30\"]\n          if cuda_ver == 110:\n            filter_list += [\"86\"]\n        else:\n          filter_list = [\"80\", \"86\"]\n          if cuda_ver &lt; 100:\n            filter_list += [\"75\"]\n          if cuda_ver &lt; 90:\n            filter_list += [\"70\"]\n          if cuda_ver &lt; 80:\n            filter_list += [\"60\", \"61\"]\n        sm_list = [sm for sm in sm_list if sm not in filter_list]\n      return sm_list\n    \n    def get_cuda_compute(cuda_ver):\n      if \"CUDA_COMPUTE\" in os.environ:\n        compute = os.environ[\"CUDA_COMPUTE\"]\n      else:\n        if 70 &lt;= cuda_ver &lt; 80:\n          compute = \"52\"\n        if 80 &lt;= cuda_ver &lt; 90:\n          compute = \"61\"\n        if 90 &lt;= cuda_ver &lt; 100:\n          compute = \"70\"\n        if 100 &lt;= cuda_ver &lt; 110:\n          compute = \"75\"\n        if cuda_ver == 110:\n          compute = \"80\"\n        if cuda_ver == 111:\n          compute = \"86\"\n      return compute\n    \n    def get_cuda_arch(cuda_ver):\n      if \"CUDA_ARCH\" in os.environ:\n        arch = os.environ[\"CUDA_ARCH\"]\n      else:\n        if 70 &lt;= cuda_ver &lt; 92:\n          arch = \"30\"\n        if 92 &lt;= cuda_ver &lt; 110:\n          arch = \"50\"\n        if cuda_ver == 110:\n          arch = \"52\"\n        if cuda_ver == 111:\n          arch = \"80\"\n      return arch\n\nHowever I didn't manage it to get it to work.\n\nCUDA 11.1 is not available in the repo for Ubuntu 22.04 [\n\nHowever it IS available for Ubuntu 20.04\n\nSo I downloaded the deprecated key:\n\n    wget  -O cuda-deprecated-key.pub\n\nadded it to apt:\n\n    sudo apt-key add cuda-deprecated-key.pub\n\nwrote the repository into the sources list:\n\n    sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n    deb  /\n\nallowed insecure repositories by writing into the apt.conf:\n\n    sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf\n    \n    Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories \"true\";\n\nupdated and installed cuda-toolkit-11-1:\n\n    sudo apt update\n    sudo apt install cuda-toolkit-11-1\n\nset the environment variables and installed cuda-11-1 (and pytorch) in the mamba environment:\n\n    mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge\n\ninstalled gcc 10 and G++10:\n\n    sudo apt install gcc-10 g++-10\n\ncofigured the alternatives (not required in my case):\n\n    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-10 100 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-10\n\nand installed cusim using pip.\n\nAlso the samples and my own code don't work.

Here\u2019s your fellow gen z linguist who, as many, is following the Computational Linguistics and Technology path. I am about to graduate from school this summer and I\u2019m a bit nervous about my next steps within my education.\n\n In a long term I want to do research for companies (the big ass ones, such as Google, Amazon, Duolingo, Spotify, Volvo idk), but I know that for getting there you need a PhD from a top level university (UK maybe?). I\u2019m all into doing that move, as one of the reasons why I joined Linguistics is because I love research, and always projected myself on a good PhD programme. So far my grades have been very high (top percentile), and I earned  some experience on industry and academia (two internships in startups and two collaborations in indexed academic articles about neuropsychology of language and computational methods for syntactic analysis of endangered languages). \n\nI know my options -UCL/Cambridge/Edinburgh- require a Masters degree to join their Language and Computation/Speech Tech PhD programs (is honours degree even enough?). This is why, after my gap year trying to land a job on a startup or small sized company, I am considering joining a masters degree in HCI (I got specialized on Speech Tech during my last year) or language technology in a European university (I\u2019m European so I don\u2019t have to pay fees thank god). I\u2019ve been considering Uppsala MSc in HCI or LTech (but I don\u2019t know if it will be enough to actually get into a PhD program in Cambridge (Sweden is good at research, but remains in their own bubble sometimes), Zurich University (I like that they have Major/minor structured degrees, but it\u2019s a MArts), and also Edinburgh for Speech Technology (this is my dream again, but it\u2019s too expensive and I I see no funding opportunities that are not PhD related).
