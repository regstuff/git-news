With that understanding if I am training the model on an unseen language, do I have to extend the vocabulary by adding tokens from the new language? Or the model extends its vocabulary on its own ?\n\nIf i had to provide a little more context , I can tokenize the English sentences using the pretrained tokenizer , but for the unseen language I do have a tokenizer which was trained for indic languages and it indeed does tokenize sentences properly. But what i am confused is if i do pass them to the model wouldn't it just classify as &lt;unk&gt; (unknown token?) since they're not present in its vocab?\n\nKindly help me with this , If someone can guide me about this I'd appreciate it!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1guupyx/training_mbart50_on_unseen_language_vocabulary/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China\u2019s emissions set to fall in 2024 after record growth in clean energy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-emissions-set-to-fall-in-2024-after-record-growth-in-clean-energy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran releases woman detained for undressing", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy42vxd99po", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia, Pakistan urge 'enhanced' coordination for 'peaceful and prosperous' Afghanistan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/russia-pakistan-urge-enhanced-coordination-for-peaceful-and-prosperous-afghanistan/3394142", "author": "None"}, {"title": "97-year-old former cheerleader gets to perform one more time, thanks to high school\u2019s current team", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.wbko.com/2024/11/18/97-year-old-former-cheerleader-gets-perform-one-more-time-thanks-high-schools-current-team/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Vladimir Putin is in a painful economic bind - Russia\u2019s reliance on Ch\u0456na is becoming a problem", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/11/18/vladimir-putin-is-in-a-painful-economic-bind", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Turkish strikes in Syria cut water to one million people", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79zj7rz3l4o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Total oppression\u2019: West Bank children being killed at unprecedented rate", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/west-bank-children-killed-unprecedented-rate?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other", "author": "None"}, {"title": "LAION, an AI organization, has released DISCO-12M, the largest publicly available music dataset for training audio AI models, containing 12 million links to YouTube music tracks with associated metadata.", "summary": "", "link": "https://the-decoder.com/laion-releases-new-dataset-to-advance-audio-ai-research/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hamas security forces kneecap suspected profiteers in Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/731078b6-3dd1-48b0-97d0-8b7c3270569f", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prabowo Holds Bilateral Talk with India's PM Modi", "summary": "", "link": "https://en.tempo.co/read/1942864/prabowo-holds-bilateral-talk-with-indias-pm-modi", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Exotic Powder Pulls Carbon Dioxide from the Air at a Record Rate", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exotic-powder-pulls-carbon-dioxide-from-the-air-at-a-record-rate/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia vetoes UN cease-fire resolution for Sudan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-vetoes-un-cease-fire-resolution-for-sudan/7868843.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
