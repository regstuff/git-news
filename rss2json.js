Whether you\u2019re working on sentiment analysis, spam detection, or other text classification tasks, fastc is oriented for small models and avoids fine-tuning, making it perfect for resource-constrained settings. Despite its simple approach, the performance is quite good.\n\nKey Features\n\n* Focused on CPU execution: Use efficient models like deepset/tinyroberta-6l-768d for embedding generation.\n* Cosine Similarity Classification: Instead of fine-tuning, classify texts using cosine similarity between class embedding centroids and text embeddings.\n* Efficient Multi-Classifier Execution: Run multiple classifiers without extra overhead when using the same model for embeddings.\n* Easy Export and Loading with HuggingFace: Models can be easily exported to and loaded from HuggingFace. Unlike with fine-tuning, only one model for embeddings needs to be loaded in memory to serve any number of classifiers.\n\n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1d9g5fa/lightningfast_text_classification_with_llm/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gay man \u2018tortured\u2019 in Qatar for his sexuality is sentenced: 'This is a breach of my human rights'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.advocate.com/news/british-gay-man-qatar-trial", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Major cause of inflammatory bowel disease found", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wwdd6v2wjo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Barbados' oldest sheet music to unlock enslaved people's voices - BBC News", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nn97yw42ro.amp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Humans May Be Able to Grow New Teeth Within Just 6 Years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a60952102/tooth-regrowth-human-trials-japan/?utm_source=reddit.com", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The US is putting enough solar to power 70,000 homes on old nuclear weapons sites", "summary": "", "link": "https://electrek.co/2024/06/05/us-solar-nuclear-weapons-sites/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sweden to ban bottom fishing in all territorial waters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/sweden-to-ban-bottom-trawling-in-territorial-waters/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Three boys out for a hike discovered a T. rex fossil", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/three-boys-discovered-teenage-t-194318588.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "packing for field school", "summary": "hi everyone, I\u2019m in the process of putting together a packing list for field school in southern Italy coming up in a few months and I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips and ideas on what to pack? it will last for a month. thank you!

The dataset has a small issue with text duplication, in particular there are some substrings recurring in the \"text\" field of the dataset, for example:\n\n* In the conversational sections, sometime at the beginning of each post there is the reference to the previously cited post, so I have a duplication of texts like \"posted by X at YY\". Especially with Usenet, this text was often personalized by the single newsreader software, sometime in funny ways invented by the user. \n* In the website section, produced with scripts converting HTML to text, there is a repetition of headers and footers of the websites, so for example the list of links get repeated for each page of the website\n* In the blog section, sometime there is HTML or JS garbage, long strings of garbage repeated for several hundreds of occurrences\n\nFor a reference, this is the dataset I am talking about: [\n\nI would like to work on a cleaned version of the dataset that addresses these issues, but I don't know where to start. I have some ideas for a strategy, for example to identify n-grams that occurs too much and then write regex to remove them, but I am not sure if this is the most efficient method both computationally and time-wise.\n\nI am very busy with other projects, and this dataset work was really time consuming so I'd like some quicker method even if not 100% perfect. I also think that this is somehow an already kind of solved problem, but I was not able to find a solution online so I am asking for help.\n\nWe are talking about 500GB of material and I have at disposal a 24 core Epyc server of the University.
