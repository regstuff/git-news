Four such tunnels have been discovered this year.\n\nThe most recent was found by the Polish border guard last week near the village of Narewka in eastern Poland. The entrance was around 50 metres inside Belarus, while the exit was located 10 metres inside Poland. The tunnel had a height of around 1.5 metres.\n\nElectronic monitoring systems determined that around 180 people had travelled through the tunnel, but 130 of them were quickly detained by the Polish authorities. They were primarily citizens of Afghanistan and Pakistan, while others included Indians, Nepalis and Bangladeshis.\n\nThe border guard also detained two so-called \u201ccouriers\u201d who had come to collect the migrants and transport them to western Europe. One was a 69-year-old Pole, the other a 49-year-old Lithuanian.\n\nOn Monday this week, the border guard announced that nine further migrants, mostly Afghans, who came through the tunnel had been apprehended.\n\nPoland\u2019s border guard shared an image of some of those detained after going through the border tunnel.\n\nThe tunnel was the fourth discovered by Poland along the Belarusian border this year. Speaking to broadcaster RMF on Monday, deputy interior minister Czes\u0142aw Mroczek said that this is a sign of how effective Poland has been in sealing off the border.\n\n\u201cDigging these tunnels means that our effectiveness in stopping migration is so high that it was decided to bring in\u00a0specialists from the Middle East to dig them, as our findings indicate from interviewing those who attempted to get to the Polish side,\u201d said Mroczek.\n\nThe deputy minister was asked if these could be people who have experience digging tunnels in Gaza and Syria.\n\n\u201cWe have Syrian citizens among the migrants,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cIn short, we have people there who are experienced in such activities, and because previous methods have failed, they are trying to enter through tunnels. We are prepared for this. We are reconfiguring the entire system to detect underground activity.\u201d\n\nIn further comments to RMF today, interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski said that \u201cmigrants from Kurdistan \\[a region that partially lies in Syria\\] are involved in digging these tunnels\u201d. But he made clear that it is the Belarusian authorities that are ultimately responsible\n\nSince 2021, Belarus has been\u00a0[encouraging and helping](\u00a0tens of thousands of migrants \u2013 mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa \u2013 to cross the border in what Polish and EU authorities\u00a0[call](\u00a0a \u201chybrid attack\u201d.\n\nIn response, Poland has built\u00a0[physical](\u00a0and\u00a0[electronic barriers](\u00a0along the border and, last year, introduced a tougher migration strategy, including temporarily\u00a0[limiting the right to claim asylum](", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/16/poland-says-specialists-from-middle-east-digging-migrant-tunnels-under-belarus-border/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli settler kills 16-year-old Palestinian in West Bank, mayor says", "summary": "* **Israeli settler shoots Palestinian teen after funeral, mayor says**\n* **Israel security source says Israeli citizen transferred to police for questioning**\n* **US reiterates call for end to West Bank violence, opposition to annexation**\n\nAn Israeli settler shot dead a 16-year-old Palestinian in the town of Tuqu' on Tuesday after the funeral of another teenager, the town's mayor said.\n\nViolence has escalated in the West Bank since the beginning of the [war in Gaza]( in October 2023.

Next week, a Polish court is due to decide whether to issue an arrest warrant for Ziobro.\n\nZiobro left Poland for Hungary in October, shortly before Poland\u2019s justice minister and prosecutor general\u00a0[asked parliament](\u00a0to lift his immunity from prosecution. That request was\u00a0[approved by parliament](\u00a0in November, opening the way for prosecutors to bring charges against Ziobro.\n\nHowever, he has subsequently remained in Hungary, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a close ally of Ziobro\u2019s national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. Earlier this month, Ziobro was also in Brussels, where he was seen visiting the European Parliament.\n\nLast month, Polish foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski announced that Ziobro\u2019s diplomatic passport had been revoked at the request of prosecutors. Today, interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski revealed that Ziobro\u2019s main passport had now also been invalidated by the governor of Masovia province, where it was issued.\n\n\u201cNo one will escape responsibility,\u201d wrote Kierwi\u0144ski in a post on X.\n\nOn 22 December, Warsaw\u2019s district court is due to consider a request from prosecutors to issue a warrant for Ziobro\u2019s arrest. That can in turn be used as the basis for a European Arrest Warrant to be issued if the suspect remains outside the country.\n\nProsecutors accuse Ziobro of a range of offences linked to the management of the Justice Fund, which was intended to support crime victims but which they say was misused for political purposes.\n\nAmong the charges he is facing are establishing and leading a criminal group and abusing his powers for personal and political gain. If found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nZiobro denies wrongdoing and says the case against him is part of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d by the current government, which has pledged to hold former PiS-era officials to account for alleged crimes.\n\nLast month, Ziobro\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that he would only return to Poland \u201cwhen the rule of law is restored\u201d. His lawyer has told prosecutors that Ziobro is willing to be questioned abroad, either in Hungary or Belgium.\n\nLast year, one of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy justice ministers, Marcin Romanowski, likewise fled to Hungary instead of facing charges in Poland. He was\u00a0[granted political asylum](\u00a0by Budapest, prompting an angry response from the Polish government, which\u00a0[withdrew its ambassador](\n\nZiobro has so far not sought to claim asylum in Hungary, though that may change if and when a European Arrest Warrant is issued, as that would normally require Hungary to transfer the suspect to Poland.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/16/poland-revokes-passport-of-ex-justice-minister-ziobro-who-fled-abroad-amid-criminal-charges/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[UK] Inside the High Court Showdown Between the Metropolitan Police and the Freemasons", "summary": "", "link": "https://ponderwall.com/index.php/2025/12/17/met-police-freemasonry-legal-challenge-2025/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
