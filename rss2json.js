That request was\u00a0[approved by parliament](\u00a0in November, opening the way for prosecutors to bring charges against Ziobro.\n\nHowever, he has subsequently remained in Hungary, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a close ally of Ziobro\u2019s national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. Earlier this month, Ziobro was also in Brussels, where he was seen visiting the European Parliament.\n\nLast month, Polish foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski announced that Ziobro\u2019s diplomatic passport had been revoked at the request of prosecutors. Today, interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski revealed that Ziobro\u2019s main passport had now also been invalidated by the governor of Masovia province, where it was issued.\n\n\u201cNo one will escape responsibility,\u201d wrote Kierwi\u0144ski in a post on X.\n\nOn 22 December, Warsaw\u2019s district court is due to consider a request from prosecutors to issue a warrant for Ziobro\u2019s arrest. That can in turn be used as the basis for a European Arrest Warrant to be issued if the suspect remains outside the country.\n\nProsecutors accuse Ziobro of a range of offences linked to the management of the Justice Fund, which was intended to support crime victims but which they say was misused for political purposes.\n\nAmong the charges he is facing are establishing and leading a criminal group and abusing his powers for personal and political gain. If found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nZiobro denies wrongdoing and says the case against him is part of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d by the current government, which has pledged to hold former PiS-era officials to account for alleged crimes.\n\nLast month, Ziobro\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that he would only return to Poland \u201cwhen the rule of law is restored\u201d. His lawyer has told prosecutors that Ziobro is willing to be questioned abroad, either in Hungary or Belgium.\n\nLast year, one of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy justice ministers, Marcin Romanowski, likewise fled to Hungary instead of facing charges in Poland. He was\u00a0[granted political asylum](\u00a0by Budapest, prompting an angry response from the Polish government, which\u00a0[withdrew its ambassador](\n\nZiobro has so far not sought to claim asylum in Hungary, though that may change if and when a European Arrest Warrant is issued, as that would normally require Hungary to transfer the suspect to Poland.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/16/poland-revokes-passport-of-ex-justice-minister-ziobro-who-fled-abroad-amid-criminal-charges/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[UK] Inside the High Court Showdown Between the Metropolitan Police and the Freemasons", "summary": "", "link": "https://ponderwall.com/index.php/2025/12/17/met-police-freemasonry-legal-challenge-2025/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan tops global humanitarian crisis watchlist for third year as devastating war grips the country", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/sudan-tops-global-humanitarian-crisis-watchlist-year-devastating-128450752", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Eight eastern EU member states meet for inaugural security summit in Helsinki", "summary": "The leaders of eight countries on the European Union\u2019s eastern flank have met in the first summit of its kind to discuss closer security cooperation.\n\nAt the gathering in Helsinki, Finland and Poland announced that they would jointly lead a planned EU initiative, dubbed Eastern Flank Watch, to bolster defences in frontline states. They were joined in the Finnish capital by Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania and Lithuania.\n\nThe threat of Russia \u2013 which five of the eight countries border \u2013 was top of the agenda at the inaugural Eastern Flank Summit.\n\n\u201cRussia is the most significant, direct and long-term threat to our security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area,\u201d read the first sentence of a 13-point\u00a0[joint declaration](\u00a0signed by the participating leaders.\n\nOther parts emphasised the need to support Ukraine and to bolster European defence spending and military readiness, including Poland\u2019s\u00a0[East Shield programme](\u00a0to bolster security infrastructure on its borders with Belarus and Russia.\n\n\u201cBy uniting at the highest political level, we send a clear and unequivocal message: Europe\u2019s Eastern Flank is a common responsibility and must be defended with urgency, leadership and resolve,\u201d concluded the declaration.\n\nThe prime ministers of Finland and Poland, Petteri Orpo and Donald Tusk, announced that their two countries would together lead Eastern Flank Watch, an initiative to strengthen defences in frontline states that was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in September.\n\nHer announcement came just days after\u00a0[multiple Russian drones entered Polish airspace](\u00a0in an unprecedented violation of NATO and EU territory.\n\nHowever,\u00a0*Politico Europe*\u00a0reports that Eastern Flank Watch and another European Commission proposal, the European Drone Defence Initiative, have received a \u201clukewarm reception\u201d from France, Germany and Hungary, making it unclear if they will get EU backing.\n\nAt today\u2019s summit, Tusk said that the eastern-flank states would seek to apply \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d in order to obtain support for the initiatives, reports Euractiv.\n\n\u201cEurope finally understands that protection of our eastern border is our common responsibility,\u201d declared Tusk in Helsinki. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a national duty for Poland or Finland or Lithuania.
