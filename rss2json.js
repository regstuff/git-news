Your response should be structured in progressive depth levels, from surface traits to latent semantic embeddings. Each layer should include both qualitative reasoning and quantitative confidence estimation (e.g., cosine similarity between known embeddings and inferred traits).\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Level 0 - Surface Profile:\nExtract and summarize basic public information about the person (biographical data, public roles, known affiliations). Include date-based temporal mapping.\n\n2. Level 1 - Semantic Trait Vectorization:\nUsing your internal embeddings, generate a high-dimensional trait vector for this individual. List the top 10 most activated semantic nodes (e.g., \u201cinnovation,\u201d \u201ccontroversy,\u201d \u201cspirituality\u201d) with cosine similarity scores against each.\n\n3. Level 2 - Comparative Embedding Alignment:\nCompare the embedding of this person to at least three similar or contrasting public figures. Output a cosine similarity matrix and explain what key features cause convergence/divergence.\n\n4. Level 3 - Cognitive Signature Inference:\nPredict this person\u2019s cognitive style using formal models (e.g., systematizer vs empathizer, Bayesian vs symbolic reasoning). Justify with behavioral patterns, quotes, or decisions.\n\n5. Level 4 - Belief and Value System Projection:\nEstimate the individual\u2019s philosophical or ideological orientation. Use latent topic modeling to align them with inferred belief systems (e.g., techno-optimism, Taoism, libertarianism).\n\n6. Level 5 - Influence Topography:\nMap this individual\u2019s influence sphere. Include their effect on domains (e.g., AI ethics, literature, geopolitics), key concept propagation vectors, and second-order influence (those influenced by those influenced).\n\n7. Level 6 - Deep Symbolic Encoding (Experimental):\nIf symbolic representations of identity are available (e.g., logos, mythic archetypes, philosophical metaphors), interpret and decode them into vector-like meaning clusters. Align these with Alpay-type algebraic forms if possible.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nStructured as a report with each layer labeled, confidence values included, and embedding distances stated where relevant.

We've often heard stories glorifying her sacrifices and unconditional gifts, so much so that the image of the ideal mother has become firmly ingrained in our minds, beyond dispute.\nBut is this the only possible image?\nAre we blind to other faces left untold? Faces of mothers whose maternal feelings have turned into jealousy and hostility, into rivalry and competition, and perhaps even into deep-seated hatred?\nIn this article, we lift the veil on that unspoken side and speak frankly about what may be the most painful image of all: the image of the \u201cworst mother.\u201d\n\nIrene of Athens:\nIrene was born into a noble Athenian family, the Sarantapechos family. Her uncle, Constantine Sarantapechos\u2014or Constantine V\u2014was a Roman patrician and governor of the Theme of Hellas.\nOn November 1st, 769, Irene was brought to Constantinople by order of her uncle, Emperor Constantine V.\nOn December 17th, she married her cousin, Leo IV.\nOn January 14th, 771, Irene gave birth to a son named Constantine VI.\nLeo ascended the throne in September 775 AD and died on September 8th, 780 AD, leaving the throne to his son Constantine VI, who was either nine or ten years old at the time.\nIrene served as the effective regent for Constantine, placing the government under her direct control.\nWhen Constantine turned twelve, Irene began seeking closer ties with the Carolingians and the Papacy. She initiated marriage negotiations between her son and Charlemagne\u2019s daughter, Rotrude.\nBoth Charlemagne and Irene welcomed the idea to such an extent that Irene sent a Roman tutor to the Frankish court to teach Rotrude Greek language, literature, and the complex religious rituals of the palace.\nFour years later, when Constantine turned sixteen, Charlemagne personally approved the engagement.\nHowever, Irene soon changed her mind about the marriage. Fearing the union of Charlemagne\u2019s power with Constantine, who had reached adulthood and had the right to rule independently, she canceled the engagement herself.\nIrene sought a wife for her son who would be more in line with her desires. She contacted a pious man from one of the villages of Cappadocia\u2014some say from Amorium\u2014who had three daughters and was known for his good reputation and noble character. She asked for his consent for Constantine to marry one of his daughters. The marriage was arranged, and Constantine wed a girl named Maria.\nAs Irene\u2019s power and influence grew, so did Constantine\u2019s resentment. Wanting to assert his own authority and distance himself from his mother\u2019s control, he conspired\u2014alongside a group of plotters\u2014to exile her to the island of Sicily.\nThe conspiracy failed. Irene discovered the plan, arrested the conspirators\u2014including her son\u2014had them flogged and exiled. Constantine was not spared; she had him whipped and imprisoned in the palace for a long time.\nAs further punishment and to reinforce her dominance, Irene forced the army to swear an oath not to recognize her son as emperor. This, however, was a misstep. The Armenian regiments were outraged by the idea of taking orders from a woman and rejected the notion of absolute power being in her hands.\nThe army besieged the palace, forcing Irene to relinquish the throne to her son. He agreed to recall her from exile and acknowledged her as co-ruler.\nStill, Irene was not content. She continued to seek a way to get rid of her son and undermine his political standing. She devised a plan to turn the clergy against him by exploiting his strained relationship with his wife, Maria. She introduced one of her maidservants\u2014renowned for her beauty and poor morals\u2014into Constantine\u2019s circle, hoping he would fall for her.\nIrene\u2019s scheme succeeded: Constantine fell in love with the maidservant, named Theodote. Irene then encouraged him to divorce Maria and marry Theodote. Constantine followed his mother\u2019s advice and divorced Maria.\nThis event caused an uproar among the religious circles, who regarded marriage as a sacred, eternal bond. The clergy expressed strong opposition, which Irene encouraged.\nConstantine responded violently to this backlash: he ordered the arrest and torture of the monks at the monastery.\nThe following summer, Constantine launched a campaign to the East. Irene, fearing his return in triumph and the resurgence of his popularity, summoned him back to Constantinople. He returned without engaging in battle.\nOn his return, his army turned against him under Irene\u2019s command. He was captured and imprisoned in the palace.\nIn 797, Irene had Constantine\u2019s eyes gouged out in the very room where he was born\u2014thus taking from him the light of life forever.\nConstantine died a few days later from his injuries. With his death, Irene seized complete control of the empire and took the title of Emperor.\nYou might think the story ends here, that Irene got what she wanted, and that her tale concluded with a happy ending. But\u2026\n\nOn a morning in 802 AD, Constantinople simmered with tension within the walls of its imperial palace. Empress Irene of Athens had reached the peak of her reign, holding an unprecedented power no woman before her had ever wielded. Yet, she stood isolated, surrounded by suspicion and conspiracies.\nThe memory of her deposition of her son and the blinding of his eyes still lingered in the minds of state and church officials, haunting her as an unforgettable disgrace. Her economic policies had burdened both the people and the nobility, increasing the silent resentment within the army and the administration.\nIn this atmosphere, the financial minister Nikephoros emerged as a man of reason and strategy. He saw, with a discerning eye, that Irene\u2019s continued rule threatened the empire\u2019s stability. He quietly formed an alliance of statesmen, military leaders, and elites\u2014convinced he was the one who could restore balance and save the empire from collapse.\nThe decisive moment came with surprising calm. Taking advantage of Irene\u2019s distraction with political marriage plans involving Charlemagne, he deposed her without much resistance.\n The Empress was exiled to a remote island, where she spent her final years in solitude and humility, as if living out a penance for her turbulent rule.\nAs for Nikephoros, he ascended the throne with promises of reform\u2014but soon faced fierce struggles of his own. Thus, the fate of the Byzantine throne remained forever at the mercy of intrigue and the endless struggle for power.\n\nIn your opinion, is it really the worst, and did Constantine VI deserve it?\nWhat about him, was he a bad son?", "link": "https://i.redd.it/o91n6hw5ot4f1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "It\u2019s not possible to stop push-in from India: Foreign adviser", "summary": "", "link": "https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/v7g10nfwig", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Experiences from UK archaeologists?", "summary": "I finished my masters last year in cultural heritage and have struggled to find much in the way of opportunities, I focused a lot on archeology for my undergrad so am considering trying to go more this direction. \n\nI\u2019ve followed the sub for a while and have seen and heard a lot of the horror stories - long days, no social life, poor pay, etc\u2026 is it really all as bad as it sounds?

When I was younger it was exciting to travel away from home, work outside all day, and get to go to remote locations. But now I\u2019m almost a decade in and I\u2019m burnt out from having to work 12+ hour days, on weekends, and on construction sites. I've had several workplace injuries and close calls in remote areas. I also think this industry can be very hard as a woman, as I am often the only woman on job sites, and in remote camps. I\u2019ve experienced workplace harassment on numerous occasions, which has not been taken seriously by my superiors. I\u2019m tired of being put in these situations as a young woman without proper support. I\u2019ve worked at several different companies (of varying size and ownership) in the industry and I think these are, unfortunately, industry wide problems. \n\nI\u2019m at a point in my career where I can make the next step to become a senior archaeologist but all the seniors above me are stressed out of their minds. This doesn\u2019t seem like a promising future, so I\u2019m looking at a career change and I\u2019m also grieving the career I built and was once so proud and excited about. A part of me also feels guilty not sticking it out so I can make some change for the younger generation of women too.\n\nWith all that being said, I wanted any advice on switching careers from those who have done it successfully. I have report writing, analysis, GIS, and some coding experience. I'm good with technology so maybe looking at something in the tech space where being able to report write and understand (past) humans may be beneficial. How can we leverage our archaeological skills to other opportunities? \n\nNote: I've seen other people recommend archaeologists go for a GIS analyst position, but entry level GIS positions seem quite low paying in comparison to what I currently make, and I would probably not be competitive against people with actual GIS degrees.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1l2p4hc/switching_careers_from_archaeology_advice_needed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prototyping with own design system", "summary": "Hello, do any of you have a guidance or tutorials on creating prototypes with our own design system (we have Storybook).
