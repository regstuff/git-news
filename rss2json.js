It's not clear if I also need to do the steps underneath \"Pip installation\" though? \n\nAfter that I was lost. I don't know how to launch or use unsloth, how to insert the LLM I found online, whether it has to be Mistral 7b, or it can also be something like \"NousResearch/Hermes-2-pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF\" which had a lot of downloads on GPT4ALL which means it must be better since it's also newer maybe? And also not how to give it the information it needs and how to use CUDA to train it.\n\nSo far searching google for \"Mistral 7b unsloth cuda\" combined with \"llm learning\" only gives me results like this: [ which require me to install everything unsloth related on a ubuntu WSL instead.. I got stuck at where they need me to use a terminal on the working folder but I think it has to be in the WSL ubuntu?\n\nDo I really need to do everything all over again but within WSL ubuntu?
