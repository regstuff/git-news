So I wrote a small bridge that makes n8n workflows look like OpenAI models.\n\nbasically it sits between any OpenAI-compatible client like Open WebUI and n8n webhooks and translates the API format. handles streaming and non-streaming responses, tracks sessions so my agents remember conversations, and lets me map multiple n8n workflows as different \u201cmodels\u201d.\n\nwhy I built this: instead of building agents and automations in chat interfaces from scratch, I can keep using n8n\u2019s workflow builder for all my logic (agents, tools, memory, whatever) and then just point Open WebUI or any OpenAI API compatible tool at it. my n8n workflow gets the messages, does its thing, and sends back responses.\n\nsetup: pretty straightforward - map n8n webhook URLs to model names in a json file, set a bearer token for auth, docker compose up. example workflow is included.\n\nI tested it with:\n\n- Open WebUI\n- LibreChat\n- OpenAI API curls\n\nrepo: \n\nif you run into issues enable LOG_REQUESTS=true to see what\u2019s happening. not trying to replace anything, just found this useful for my homelab and figured others might want it too.\n\nbackground: this actually started as a Python function for Open WebUI that I had working, but it felt too cumbersome and wasn\u2019t easy to maintain. the extension approach meant dealing with Open WebUI\u2019s pipeline system and keeping everything in sync. switching to a standalone bridge made everything simpler - now it\u2019s just a standard API server that works with any OpenAI-compatible client, not just Open WebUI. \n\nYou can find the Open WebUi pipeline here, it\u2019s a spin off of the other popular n8n pipe: GitHub - sveneisenschmidt/openwebui-n8n-function: Simplified and optimized n8n pipeline for Open WebUI.

The historian Mary Beard and the actor Damian Lewis, the latter speaking via video message, both gave impassioned speeches as they spoke about the importance of raising \u00a33.5m to purchase the object and ensure it does not disappear into a private collection.\n\nThe Tudor Heart, as it has become known, was discovered by the amateur metal detectorist Charlie Clarke in 2019, in a field in Warwickshire\u2014and reported under the Treasure Act 1996, which gives museums \u201cfirst dibs\u201d on potential treasures. One side of the pendant is decorated with an image of a Tudor rose intertwined with a pomegranate tree, symbols relating to Henry and Katherine respectively; the other features the letters \u201cH\u201d and \u201cK\u201d, bound together with white thread.

It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it \ud83d\ude09) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I\u2019ve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I\u2019ve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!\n", "link": "https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Project Release] SNMPy &amp; SNMP Browser \u2013 Open-source Python tools for exploring and monitoring SNMP devices (v1/v2c/v3)", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/snmpware/Snmp-Browser", "author": "None"}, {"title": "This is the only open-source AI agent builder that actually works\u2014meet Blank Space \ud83d\udd25", "summary": "\nThis is the only open-source AI agent builder that actually works\u2014meet Blank Space ", "link": "https://github.com/BrandeisPatrick/blank-space", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'We're watching you': Israel drops leaflets warning Palestinians not to celebrate prisoner releases", "summary": "What ", "link": "https://news.sky.com/video/were-watching-you-israel-drops-leaflets-warning-palestinians-not-to-celebrate-prisoner-releases-13449410", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MergeSVG 2.0: Resize SVGs exactly how you want and say goodbye to broken SVGs", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/whiteSHADOW1234/MergeSVG", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Philosoph Died Laughing at a Donkey", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/hive-121566/@melancholic.bear/died-laughing-at-a-donkeytotgelacht-wegen-eines-esels-engde", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mongolian President Khurelsukh\u2019s India Visit Will Redefine the Strategic Partnership", "summary": "", "link": "https://thediplomat.com/2025/10/mongolian-president-khurelsukhs-india-visit-will-redefine-the-strategic-partnership/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can you slow down response speed", "summary": "When I use small models the responses are so fast they just show up in one big chunk, is there any way to make it output at a certain rate, Ideally it would output about the same rate that I can read. \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1o6zpgv/can_you_slow_down_response_speed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UBC launches mushroom-powered toilet, eliminating waste", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ubc-mushroom-toilet-9.6936552", "author": "None"}, {"title": "4,000-year-old skull found along Indiana riverbank: Coroner", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1o6xuvp/4000yearold_skull_found_along_indiana_riverbank/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I built JSONxplode a complex json flattener", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/ThanatosDrive/jsonxplode", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\"I can hardly believe it, and it's taken me quite a long time,\" she said.
