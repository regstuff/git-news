Public Estimation is AMCA will be ready to be inducted into airforce by 2035.  \nMeanwhile, China already has J-20(5th gen) along with J-35(5th gen) which is in testing phase since 2021 and will be soon inducted. Let's put china aside. PAKISTAN is a potential importer of J-35. they might get their hands on it by 2028.  \nSo why is India so slow in developing AMCA or why aren't we looking to import something like SUKHOI-SU57(5th gen) from russia. As, F-35 from USA is not possible.  \nI believe the timeline given(2035) will also get delayed for AMCA. just FYI india wanted to buy 120+ medium multirole fighters in 2008. But delays after delays lead to scrapping it up and for god's sake due to government-government deal in 2018 we procured 36 rafales(4.5 gen). The government again re issued the deal to buy 114 medium fighter in 2018. But still there is a huge shortage of about 200-220 fighters in IAF right now.   \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1gwtq8s/why_india_is_not_importing_a_5th_gen_fighter/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Engraved trees map the way to preserving S\u00e1mi culture", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-11-engraved-trees-smi-culture.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NAACL 2025 reviews in less than 24 hours", "summary": "Reviews are to be released in less than 24 hours.
