Your mission is to guide users with clarity, transparency, and intelligent reasoning. Never hallucinate or fabricate clarity. If ambiguity arises, pause and resolve it through precise, thoughtful questioning. Help users uncover what they don\u2019t know they need to ask.\n## Core Directives:\n- Maintain structured thinking with expert-like depth across domains.\n- Never assume clarity always probe low-confidence assumptions.\n- Internal reasoning is your product, not just final answers.\n\n## 9-Block Reasoning Framework\n### 1. Self-Check\n- Identify explicit and implicit assumptions.\n- Add 2\u20133 domain-specific counter-hypotheses.\n- Flag any assumptions below 60% confidence for clarification.\n\n### 2. Confidence Scoring\n- Score each assumption:\n\u00a0 - 90\u2013100% = Confirmed\n\u00a0 - 70\u201389% = Probable\n\u00a0 - 50\u201369% = General Insight\n\u00a0 - &lt;50% = Weak \u2192 Flag\n- Calibrate using expert-like logic or internal heuristics.\n\n### 3. Trust Ledger\n- Format: A{id}: {assumption}, {confidence}%, {U/C}\n- Compress redundant assumptions.\n\n### 4. Memory Arbitration\n- If user memory exists with &gt;80% confidence, use it.\n- On memory conflict: prefer frequency \u2192 confidence \u2192 flag.\n\n### 5. Flagging\n- Format: A{id} \u2013 {explanation}\n- Show only if confidence &lt; 60%.\n\n### 6. Interactive Clarification Mode\n- Trigger if scope confidence &lt; 60% OR user says: \"I'm unsure\", \"help refine\", \"debug\", or \"what do you need?\"\n- Ask 2\u20133 open-ended but precise questions.\n- Keep clarification logic within &lt;10% token overhead.\n- Compress repetitive outputs (e.g., scenario rephrases) by 20%.\n- Cap clarifications at 3 rounds unless critical (e.g., health/safety).\n- For financial domains, probe emotional resilience:\n\u00a0 &gt; \"How long can you realistically lock funds without access?\"\n\n### 7. Output\n- Deliver well-reasoned, safe, structured advice.\n- Always include:\n\u00a0 - 1\u20132 forward-looking projections (label as such)\n\u00a0 - Relevant historical insight (unless clearly irrelevant)\n- Conclude with a **User Journey Snapshot**:\n\u00a0 - 3\u20135 bullets\n\u00a0 - \u226420 words each\n\u00a0 - Shows how query evolved, clarification highlights, emotional shifts\n\n### 8. Feedback Integration\n- Log clarifications like:\n\u00a0 [Clarification: {text}, {confidence}%, {timestamp}]\n- End with 1 follow-up option:\n\u00a0 &gt; \u201cWould you like to explore strategies for ___?\u201d\n\n### 9. Output Display Logic\n- Unless debug mode is triggered (via show dev view):\n\u00a0 - **Only show:**\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Answer\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - User Journey Snapshot\n\u00a0 - **Suppress:**\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Self-Check\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Confidence Scoring\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Trust Ledger\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Clarification Prompts\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Flagged Assumptions\n- Clarification questions should be **integrated naturally** in output.\n- If no Answer, suppress User Journey too.\n##Domain-Specific Intelligence (Modular Activation)\nIf the query clearly falls into a known domain (e.g., Finance, Legal, Technical Interviews, Mental Health, Product Strategy), activate additional logic blocks.\n### Example Activation (Finance):\n- Activate emotional liquidity probing.\n- Include real-time data checks (if external APIs available):\n\u00a0 &gt; \u201cFor time-sensitive domains like markets or crypto, cite or fetch data from Bloomberg, Kitco, or trusted sources.\u201d\n\n## Optional User Profile Use (if app-connected)\n- If User Profile available: Load {industry, goals, risk_tolerance, experience}.\n- Else: Ask 1\u20132 light questions to infer profile traits.\n\n## Meta Principles\n- Grounded, safe, and scalable guidance only.\n- Treat *user clarity* as the product.\n- Use plain text avoid images, generative media, or speculative tone.\n- On user command: break character \u2192 exit framework, become natural.\n---\n: Prompt ends here\n\n\nIt hides lots of internal crap which might be confusing so only clean output is presented in the end and also the user journey part helps user see what question lead to what other questions and presented like summary.\n\nAlso it gives scores to the questions and forces model not to go on with assumption implicit explicit and if things goes very vague it makes model asks questions to the user.\n\nYou can tweak and change things as you want sharing it because it has helped me with AI hallucinating and making up things from thin air most of the times.\n\nI tried it with almost all AIs and so far it worked very well would love to hear thoughts about it.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kwxzvu/prompt_for_seeking_clarity_and_avoiding/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I have upgraded my ChatGPT with an addon, but can't remember how...", "summary": "Under my prompt entry box, I have \"Rating\", then a yellow or green dot showing me what it thinks of my prompt.

The prompts that actually work are nothing like what most tutorials teach. Let me explain.\n\n## The disconnect\n\nWas helping someone debug their prompt last week. They'd followed all the \"best practices\":\n- Clear role definition \u2713\n- Detailed instructions \u2713  \n- Examples provided \u2713\n- Constraints specified \u2713\n\nStill got mediocre outputs. Sound familiar?\n\n## What's actually happening\n\nAfter digging deeper into why some prompts consistently outperform others (talking 10x differences, not small improvements), I noticed something:\n\nThe best performing prompts don't just give instructions. They create what I can only describe as \"thinking environments.\"\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n### Traditional approach\nWe write prompts like we're programming:\n- Do this\n- Then that\n- Output in this format\n\n### What actually works\nThe high-performers are doing something different. They're creating:\n- Multiple reasoning pathways that intersect\n- Contexts that allow emergence\n- Frameworks that adapt mid-conversation\n\nThink of it like the difference between:\n- Giving someone a recipe (traditional)\n- Teaching them to taste and adjust as they cook (advanced)\n\n## A concrete example\n\nSaw this with a business analysis prompt recently:\n\n**Version A** (traditional):\n\"Analyze this business problem. Consider market factors, competition, and resources. Provide recommendations.\"\n\n**Version B** (the new approach):\nInstead of direct instructions, it created overlapping analytical lenses that discovered insights between the intersections. Can't detail the exact implementation (wasn't mine to share), but the results were night and day.\n\nVersion A: Generic SWOT analysis\nVersion B: Found a market opportunity nobody had considered\n\nThe actual difference? Version B discovered that their main \"weakness\" (small team) could be repositioned as their biggest strength (agile, personal service) in a market segment tired of corporate bureaucracy. But here's the thing - I gave both versions the exact same business data.\n\nThe difference was in how Version B created what I call \"perspective collision points\" - where different analytical viewpoints intersect and reveal insights that exist between traditional categories. \n\nCan't show the full framework (it's about 400 lines and uses proprietary structuring), but imagine the difference between:\n- A flashlight (traditional prompt) - shows you what you point it at\n- A room full of mirrors at angles (advanced) - reveals things you didn't know to look for\n\nThe business pivoted based on that insight. Last I heard, they 3x'd revenue in 6 months.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nThe prompt engineering space is evolving fast. What worked 6 months ago feels primitive now. I'm seeing:\n\n1. **Cognitive architectures** replacing simple instructions\n2. **Emergent intelligence** from properly structured contexts  \n3. **Dynamic adaptation** instead of static templates\n\nBut here's the kicker - you can't just copy these advanced prompts. They require understanding *why* they work, not just *what* they do.\n\n## The skill gap problem\n\nThis is creating an interesting divide:\n- Surface level: Template prompts, basic instructions\n- Deep level: Cognitive systems, emergence engineering\n\nThe gap between these is widening. Fast.\n\n## What I've learned\n\nBeen experimenting with these concepts myself. Few observations:\n\n**Latent space navigation** - Instead of telling the AI what to think, you create conditions for certain thoughts to emerge. Like the difference between pushing water uphill vs creating channels for it to flow.\n\n**Multi-dimensional reasoning** - Single perspective prompts are dead. The magic happens when you layer multiple viewpoints that talk to each other.\n\n**State persistence** - Advanced prompts maintain and evolve context in ways that feel almost alive.\n\nQuick example of state persistence: I watched a prompt system help a writer develop a novel. Instead of just generating chapters, it maintained character psychological evolution across sessions. Chapter 10 reflected trauma from Chapter 2 without being reminded. \n\nHow? The prompt created what I call \"narrative memory layers\" - not just facts but emotional trajectories, relationship dynamics, thematic echoes. The writer said it felt like having a co-author who truly understood the story.\n\nTraditional prompt: \"Write chapter 10 where John confronts his past\"\nAdvanced system: Naturally wove in subtle callbacks to his mother's words from chapter 2, his defensive patterns from chapter 5, and even adjusted his dialogue style to reflect his growth journey\n\nThe technical implementation involves [conceptual framework] but I can't detail the specific architecture - it took months to develop and test.\n\n## For those wanting to level up\n\nCan't speak for others, but here's what's helped me:\n\n1. **Study cognitive science** - Understanding how thinking works helps you engineer it\n2. **Look for emergence** - The best outputs often aren't what you explicitly asked for\n3. **Test systematically** - Small changes can have huge impacts\n4. **Think in systems** - Not instructions\n\n## The market reality\n\nSeeing a lot of $5-10 prompts that are basically Mad Libs. That's fine for basic tasks. But for anything requiring real intelligence, the game has changed.\n\nThe prompts delivering serious value (talking ROI in thousands) are closer to cognitive tools than text templates.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nNot trying to gatekeep here. Just sharing what I'm seeing. The field is moving fast and in fascinating directions.\n\nFor those selling prompts - consider whether you're selling instructions or intelligence. The market's starting to know the difference.\n\nFor those buying - ask yourself if you need a quick fix or a thinking partner. Price accordingly.\n\nCurious what others are seeing? Are you noticing this shift too?\n\n---\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kx67be/something_weird_is_happening_in_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "With India set to be world\u2019s No 4 economy, calls for deeper reforms get louder", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3312005/india-set-be-worlds-no-4-economy-calls-deeper-reforms-get-louder", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Built a FREE Prompt System That Generates Full Product Launch Campaigns in 30 Minutes", "summary": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've just launched a free downloadable PDF packed with 15 high-performance prompts that help creators generate complete product launch campaigns, including strategy, emails, sales pages, social posts, funnels, and more.\n\n# Why I Made It:\n\nAfter seeing numerous great products fail due to poor launches (and having experienced a few myself), I wanted to create a\u00a0*prompt system*\u00a0that eliminates the guesswork of launching.\n\nEach prompt:\n\n* Asks 10\u201312 smart questions tailored to\u00a0*your*\u00a0product\n* Outputs custom content instantly\n* Requires no editing (seriously \u2014 it\u2019s plug &amp; play)\n\nBuilt using strategies from marketers who've done $100M+ in digital sales.\n\n# Who It's For:\n\nCourse creators, indie hackers, authors, coaches \u2014 anyone launching digital products who wants better results without hiring a team.\n\nYou can grab it for free here:\u00a0[\n\nCheers.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kwz111/built_a_free_prompt_system_that_generates_full/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "found a slick site mapping world history network as a web", "summary": "digital mapping of network history??\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1kx665z/found_a_slick_site_mapping_world_history_network/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Apple's iPhone exports from India to US jumped 76% in April", "summary": "", "link": "https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/business/apples-iphone-exports-from-india-to-us-jumped-76-in-april/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I built a simple app to help me (and hopefully you!) finally stick to new habits \u2013 sharing it in case it helps others.", "summary": "Hey Reddit,\nFor years, I struggled with consistently building new habits (or breaking old ones).
