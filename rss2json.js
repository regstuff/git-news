It effectively resurrects the idea of a BD-Pak axis under Chinese patronage, threatening India's security calculus in the northeast. \n\nAt the same time, NSA Ajit Doval and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh are in Beijing for SCO meetings, engaging China even as India quietly reaffirms its oldest counterweight in the east: Vietnam.\n\n**The Stage is Set**\n\n* The Big Dragon is orchestrating a new regional map in South Asia - convening trilaterals, hosting SCO summits, and projecting pan-Asian leadership.\n* The Elephant steps cautiously, engaging Beijing on one hand, while reinforcing its flanks with historical partners like Vietnam.\n* The Little Dragon is no passive junior. It has bled the Big Dragon before, and is now fiercely defending its sovereignty in the South China Sea, and shares a deep-rooted strategic synergy with India that predates even the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war.\n\nThe following excerpt from\u00a0***Soviet Relations with India and Vietnam*** highlights how historically sensitive China has been about Vietnam\u2019s ties with India, often attempting to drive a wedge between them. It also shows how India, even during the Cold War, consistently treated Vietnam as a strategic partner, despite Beijing\u2019s pressure.\n\n**Citation**: Thakur, Ramesh, and Carlyle A. Thayer**.**\u00a0*Soviet Relations with India and Vietnam, 1945\u20131992*. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1992, pp. 241\u2013244.\n\n&gt;With the occasional cartographic help from Moscow and Hanoi, the Indian line of containment of Chinese influence in South Asia has thus been drawn in Indochina. When India's Foreign Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao visited Vietnam in February 1982, he assured his hosts that a settlement of India's border question with China would not be at the expense of its friendly relations with other countries. Efforts by China to normalise relations with India have been accompanied by rhetoric designed to drive a wedge between India and Vietnam, as well as between India and the Soviet Union. In May 1982, a Chinese official described the Sino-Indian border dispute as a historical legacy, in contrast to the Sino-Vietnamese border which required no discussion. The 25 May 1982 issue of the Vietnamese army paper\u00a0Qu\u00e2n \u0111\u1ed9i nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n\u00a0saw in this a Chinese plot to drive a wedge between India and Vietnam. After Mrs Gandhi's visit to the USSR in September 1982, an editorial in Beijing's\u00a0*People's Daily*\u00a0praised India's attempt to deviate from the Soviet Union by diversifying its arms purchases. At a seminar in New Delhi in March 1984, Vietnam's Vice Foreign Minister [Vo Von Sung]( explicitly said that India and Vietnam had 'to deal with the common enemies, namely, the Beijing expansionists in collusion with the US imperialists'.\n\n&gt;The one day visit by Rajiv (and wife Sonia) Gandhi to Vietnam on 27 November 1985 was only the second by an Indian Prime Minister, the first having been that of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. The Jawaharlal Nehru-Indira Gandhi-Rajiv Gandhi continuity was subtly emphasised in an interesting bit of diplomacy. Vietnam conferred its highest award, the Golden Star, to Indira Gandhi posthumously for her support to the reunification of Vietnam and for her fight against imperialism and foreign domination. The award was accepted by Rajiv Gandhi in a ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi on 27 November 1985 in the presence of President [Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh]( Party Secretary [L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]( and Prime Minister [Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]( of whom would have known Mrs Gandhi personally. Coming just a year after her assassination (which was marked by a three-day period of official mourning in Vietnam, with President Chinh leading the Vietnamese delegation to her funeral), this would have been calculated to have an emotional impact upon her son.\n\n&gt;Recalling the 'horror of genocide' through which they had lived through, Rajiv Gandhi for his part affirmed India's solidarity with the Cambodian people. In an oblique reference to a common anti-China sentiment, Gandhi remarked that while India had been a friend of Vietnam through the millennia, it 'had never played the giant'. The Chinese media noted the visit and the fact that Vietnamese leaders were satisfied with Indian support for their actions in Cambodia and recognition of the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). **A Chinese naval squadron called in at Karachi, Colombo and Chittagong a week after the Gandhi trip to Vietnam: the first visits by PRC warships to foreign ports. It has been suggested that the visit was a warning to New Delhi that two could play the game of supporting unfriendly neighbours.** (emphasis mine)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lk9rgm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PTC Industries' Subsidiary Aerolloy Signs MOU with Safran Aircraft Engines to Boost Indigenous Military Engine Manufacturing", "summary": "", "link": "https://hdfcsky.com/news/ptc-industries-subsidiary-aerolloy-signs-mou-with-safran-aircraft-engines", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tutorial: How to Configure LoRA Hyperparameters for Fine-tuning!", "summary": "We made a new Guide on mastering LoRA Hyperparameters, so you can learn and understand to fine-tune LLMs with the correct hyperparameters! \ud83e\udda5 The goal is to train smarter models with fewer hallucinations.\n\n\u2728 Guide link: [\n\nLearn about:\n\n* Choosing optimal values like: learning rates, epochs, LoRA rank, alpha\n* Fine-tuning with Unsloth and our default best practices values\n* Solutions to avoid overfitting &amp; underfitting\n* Our Advanced Hyperparameters Table aka a cheat-sheet for optimal values", "link": "https://i.redd.it/50ww0oq5r69f1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "You just need one prompt to become a prompt engineer!", "summary": "Everyone  is trying to sell you a $297 \u201cPrompt Engineering Masterclass\u201d right now. but 90% of that stuff is recycled fluff wrapped in a Canva slideshow.\n\nLet me save you time (and your wallet):  \nThe best prompt isn\u2019t even a prompt.
