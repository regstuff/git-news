Worse may be to come", "summary": "Erdogan asked America to break with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the predominantly Kurdish militia that helped America defeat Islamic State (IS), withdraw American troops from Syria\u2019s north-east, and outsource security in the region to Turkey and its proxies. Turkey\u2019s leader will probably make Donald Trump a similar offer. But the collapse of Syria\u2019s regime means he may also create a fait accompli.\n\nThe Kurds are celebrating the end of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s murderous reign. But their dream of autonomy is starting to fade, and fast. Already, the SDF has come under attack by the rebel Syrian National Army (SNA), a Turkish proxy (and an enemy of Mr Assad and his government). On December 1st, the SNA seized Tel Rifaat, a town close to the Turkish border, which had been under Kurdish control. A week later, its fighters took Manbij, another SDF stronghold. They now appear to be marching on Kobane, which the Kurds saved from an IS onslaught in 2015. Mr Erdogan had previously warned of a new Turkish offensive against the Kurds, designed to broaden the \u201csafe zone\u201d his troops have carved out in Syria. Through the SNA, he appears to have launched one already. For now Mr Erdogan\u2019s hand in Syria is stronger than ever.\n\nFor years, Turkey\u2019s policy in Syria was hostage to Russia, whose control over swathes of Syria\u2019s airspace gave it an effective veto over Turkish operations south of the border. Policymakers in Ankara dreaded the prospect of a Russian and regime offensive against Idlib, the province where HTS had been holed up since 2017. Such an attack would probably have propelled hundreds of thousands of Syrians, accompanied by armed radicals, into Turkey. That danger is now gone. Russia\u2019s grip over Turkey has loosened as a result.\n\nWhat now matters to Mr Erdogan more than anything else is the chance to cripple the SDF, which Turkey considers an extension of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), its sworn enemy. Had the Assad regime, weakened and bruised, stopped HTS and company at the gates of Damascus, the Kurds might have retained or even enlarged their zone of autonomous rule. Instead, they are on the back foot, facing Turkish mercenaries in the north of the country and possible Arab upheavals elsewhere. On December 11th, the HTS claimed to have captured the important eastern city of Deir ez-Zor from the SDF, who had seized it two days earlier.\n\nNow that the regime is gone, the Arabs no longer have a reason to support the SDF. The Kurds are completely isolated.", "link": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/12/11/as-syrias-regime-collapses-erdogan-eyes-victory-over-the-kurds", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bill to jail bosses of polluters to be introduced in Scottish Parliament", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd0enl0dn8jo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hannah Kobayashi, Maui woman who vanished after landing in LA last month, found safe, family says", "summary": "", "link": "https://abc7.com/post/hannah-kobayashi-case-family-says-missing-hawaii-woman-has-been-found-safe/15642285/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Overdose deaths in the US fell 17% in the past year according to CDC, the largest reduction in overdose deaths in the country\u2019s history", "summary": "", "link": "https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/health-and-medicine/2024/12/11/overdose-deaths-cdc", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Corbyn calls for NATO member Turkey to leave Syria and respect Kurdish rights", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2024/12/10/corbyn-turkey-kurds-syria/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Fascist Threat Becomes Clearer With Milei\u2019s Call for a Brown International", "summary": "", "link": "https://znetwork.org/znetarticle/the-fascist-threat-becomes-clearer-with-mileis-call-for-a-brown-international/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Korea\u2019s ruling party backs impeachment as president refuses to step down over martial law", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/asia/south-korea-ruling-party-impeachment-hnk-intl/index.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
