It\u2019s for beginners, solo devs, and anyone who wants to build smarter with fewer rabbit holes.\n\n**2. My Settings (Optional but Helpful)**\n\nIf you can tweak the model settings:\n\n* **Temperature:** 0.15 \u2192 for clean boilerplate 0.35 \u2192 for smarter refactors 0.7 \u2192 for brainstorming/API design\n* **Top-p:** Stick with 0.9, or drop to 0.6 if you want really focused answers.\n* **Deliberate Mode:** true = better diagnosis, more careful thinking.\n\n**3. The Dev Loop I Follow**\n\nHere\u2019s the rhythm that works for me:\n\n**Paste broken code \u2192 Ask GPT \u2192 Get fix + tests \u2192 Run \u2192 Iterate if needed**\n\nGPT will:\n\n* Spot the bug\n* Suggest a patch\n* Write a pytest block\n* Explain what changed\n* Show you what passed or failed\n\nBasically what a senior engineer would do when you ask: \u201cHey, can you take a look?\u201d\n\n**4. Quick Example**\n\n**Step 1: Paste this into your terminal**\n\n    cat &gt; busted.py &lt;&lt;'PY'\n    def safe_div(a, b): return a / b  # breaks on divide-by-zero\n    PY\n\n**Step 2: Ask GPT**\n\n&gt;\u201cFix [busted.py]( to handle divide-by-zero. Add a pytest test.\u201d\n\n**Step 3: Run the tests**\n\n    pytest -q\n\n**You\u2019ll probably get:**\n\n     def safe_div(a, b):\n    -    return a / b\n    +    if b == 0:\n    +        return None\n    +    return a / b\n\nAnd something like:\n\n    import pytest\n    from busted import safe_div\n    \n    def test_safe_div():\n        assert safe_div(10, 2) == 5\n        assert safe_div(10, 0) is None\n\n**5. The Prompt I Use Every Time**\n\n    ROLE: You are a senior engineer.  \n    CONTEXT: [Paste your code \u2014 around 40\u201380 lines \u2014 plus any error logs]  \n    TASK: Find the bug, fix it, and add unit tests.  \n    FORMAT: Git diff + test block.\n\nDon\u2019t overcomplicate it. GPT\u2019s better when you give it the right framing.\n\n**6. Power Moves**\n\nThese are phrases I use that get great results:\n\n* \u201cExplain lines 20\u201360 like I\u2019m 15.\u201d\n* \u201cWrite edge-case tests using Hypothesis.\u201d\n* \u201cRefactor to reduce cyclomatic complexity.\u201d\n* \u201cReview the diff you gave. Are there hidden bugs?\u201d\n* \u201cAdd logging to help trace flow.\u201d\n\nGPT responds well when you ask like a teammate, not a genie.\n\n**7. My Debugging Loop (Mental Model)**\n\n**Trace \u2192 Hypothesize \u2192 Patch \u2192 Test \u2192 Review \u2192 Merge**\n\n    Trace ----&gt; Hypothesize ----&gt; Patch ----&gt; Test ----&gt; Review ----&gt; Merge\n      ||            ||             ||          ||           ||          ||\n      \\/            \\/             \\/          \\/           \\/          \\/\n    [Find Bug]  [Guess Cause]  [Fix Code]  [Run Tests]  [Check Risks]  [Commit]\n\nThat\u2019s it. Keep it tight, keep it simple. Every language, every stack.\n\n**8. If You Want to Get Better**\n\n* Learn basic pytest\n* Understand how git diff works\n* Try ChatGPT inside VS Code (seriously game-changing)\n* Build little tools and test them like you\u2019re pair programming with someone smarter\n\n**Final Note**\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a 10x dev. You just need momentum.\n\nThis flow helps you move faster with fewer dead ends.\n\nWhether you\u2019re debugging, building, or just trying to learn without the overwhelm\u2026\n\n**Let GPT be your second engineer, not your crutch.**\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1knmvqt/how_i_use_chatgpt_like_a_senior_engineer_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Modi Has Changed India\u2019s Military Doctrine", "summary": "", "link": "https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/05/13/modi-has-changed-indias-military-doctrine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-US trade deal: India disputes Trump claim it will charge 'no tariffs'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq54ggd62w3o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "zeitgrep - grep, but sorted based on git history", "summary": "Zeitgrep lets you search\u00a0**frecently edited**\u00a0lines of code in your Git repository, ranked by how often\u00a0**and**\u00a0how recently a file has changed.\n\nIt uses Ripgrep as a regular expression search backend, and uses frecenfile (also my OC) to analyze git history.\n\nIt is an early stage project, but it is fairly scalable: you should be able to use it for live grep in most cases, so it should be a drop-in replacement for pure ripgrep in things like Telescope (neovim search plugin)", "link": "https://github.com/kantord/zeitgrep", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump says he doesn't want Apple building products in India: 'I had a little problem with Tim Cook'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/05/15/trump-told-tim-cook-he-doesnt-want-apple-building-iphones-in-india.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI Interview for School Project", "summary": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a student at the University of Amsterdam working on a school project about artificial intelligence, and i am looking for someone with experience in AI to answer a few short questions.\n\nThe interview can be super quick (5\u201310 minutes), zoom or DM (text-based).
