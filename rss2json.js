But he had now decided not to maintain the tradition, reports\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*, a leading daily.\n\nThe newspaper spoke to representatives of the Jewish community in Poland, who confirmed that no invitations have been sent by the presidential palace, despite the eight-day celebration of Hanukkah beginning on Sunday\n\nThe website of the president\u2019s chancellery does not list any planned Hanukkah events. When contacted by\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0about the issue, the president\u2019s media office failed to respond.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail in January this year, Nawrocki\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that, if elected president, he would not continue his predecessor\u2019s tradition of celebrating Hanukkah.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he told broadcast RMF when asked if he would host a celebration of the Jewish festival in the presidential palace. \u201cI take my attachment to Christian values \u200b\u200bseriously, so I celebrate holidays that are close to me as a person.\u201d\n\nDuring the final, run-off round of the election in June, Nawrocki also sought to win over the voters of eliminated candidate Grzegorz Braun, a far-right leader who infamously\u00a0[attacked a Hanukkah celebration](\u00a0in parliament, putting out the candles with a fire extinguisher.\n\nIn response to a set of questions from Braun \u2013 including whether he would \u201creject Jewish claims\u201d against Poland \u2013 Nawrocki\u00a0[wrote](\u00a0that he \u201ctakes my attachment to Christian values \u200b\u200bseriously, so I celebrate and promote holidays and the Polish traditions and customs associated with them\u201d.\n\nSubsequently, Braun, who has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, announced that he would vote for Nawrocki in the run-off. Exit polling\u00a0[showed](\u00a0that, among voters who had supported Braun in the first round and turned out in the second round, 92.5% voted for Nawrocki.\n\nHowever, after Nawrocki took office, news website Interia reported, based on inside sources, that some presidential officials still wanted to host a Hanukkah celebration \u2013 in particular to remain on good terms with the Trump administration, whose\u00a0[newly appointed ambassador](\u00a0to Poland, Tom Rose, is Jewish.\n\nWhile it now appears that no Hanukkah celebration will be organised in the presidential palace, one will take place in the Sejm, the lower house of parliament, on Monday 15 December.\n\nParliament is under the control of Poland\u2019s more liberal ruling coalition, which regularly clashes with Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nBefore the Holocaust, Poland was home to around 3.5 million Jews, roughly 10% of the country\u2019s population and the second-largest Jewish community in the world at the time, behind only the United States.

The inverted demographic pyramid, the anemic economic growth over the past several years and the fact that the US can no longer be counted as a security guarantor made the current model unsustainable. Of course the AfD blames the issue on immigrants and promises that once the \"brownies\" are kicked out, the German Welfare State will be \"great again\".\n\nThis same scenario is playing across all of Europe.\n\nMost people, governments and institutions are OK with the notion of a gradual and controlled population decline. What is alarming people is the pace of the decline we are witnessing and its impact of the composition of the demographic pyramid. When birthrates fall off a cliff, as we are seeing now, we end up with a massively large old population that needs to be supported by an ever declining young population.
