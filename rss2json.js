That was later confirmed by his lawyer, Bartosz Lewandowski, who said he had submitted the request to prosecutors on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office has two foreign addresses for Ziobro,\u201d Lewandowski told\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*. \u201cWe proposed that he be questioned through the assistance of the consular office, or through international assistance. He can appear at the agreed-upon time and place.\u201d\n\nOne of the two addresses is in Brussels, where Ziobro has reportedly been living with his family for over a year after his wife began working at the European Parliament. Ziobro has also been undergoing cancer treatment during that time. He has meanwhile remained a member of Poland\u2019s parliament.\n\n\n\nThe second address is in Budapest. The day before Poland\u2019s justice minister\u00a0[submitted a request to parliament](\u00a0to strip Ziobro of immunity,\u00a0Ziobro announced that he had arrived in Budapest for a pre-arranged event at which he said he would \u201cshow my Hungarian friends\u201d how the Polish government is \u201cviolating laws\u201d.\n\nHe appears to have remained there ever since. He even met with Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2013 an ally of Ziobro\u2019s Law and Justice (PiS) party \u2013 who posted a picture of the pair together and condemned the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against the Polish right launched by \u201cthe pro-Brusselian Polish government\u201d.\n\nIn its report,\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0suggests that Ziobro\u2019s offer to be interviewed is intended to demonstrate that he is not in hiding, which would be grounds for a court to order an arrest warrant for him. That in turn could be used to issue a European Arrest Warrant.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office has been informed of his location, so there is no question of him going into hiding, since his life has been centred outside of Poland for a long time,\u201d Lewandowski told the newspaper.\n\n\n\nShould prosecutors take up Ziobro\u2019s offer, there are two ways in which they could do it. The first would be for him to appear at a Polish consulate in Hungary or Belgium and be interviewed by the consul.\n\nThe second would be for Poland to seek international legal assistance, whereby a court or prosecutor\u2019s office in the relevant country would conduct the hearing with questions prepared by the Polish prosecutors.\n\nThere has so far been no response by prosecutors to Ziobro\u2019s proposal. However, deputy prime minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Wednesday that his questioning \u201cshould take place in Poland, not in a location designated by the person who is to testify\u201d.\n\n\u201cZiobro\u2019s impudence knows no bounds,\u201d Dariusz Jo\u0144ski, a politician from Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, told broadcaster Tok FM, suggesting sarcastically that \u201cperhaps he wants to establish a list of questions before meeting the prosecutor\u201d as well.\n\n\n\nHowever, in an interview with broadcaster Polsat on Wednesday evening, Ziobro said that he would only return to Poland \u201cwhen the rule of law is restored\u201d. He called Poland\u2019s current government a \u201ccriminal gang\u201d and said that Prime Minister Donald Tusk is \u201ccommitting crime after crime\u201d.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2023, Ziobro was the driving force behind the PiS government\u2019s highly contested judicial reforms, which saw Poland plummet in international rule-of-law rankings.\n\nProsecutors want to charge him with a long list of alleged offences committed during that time, including establishing and leading a criminal group and abusing his powers for personal and political gain. If found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\n\n\nThe 26 offences Ziobro is accused of relate to the administration of the Justice Fund, which is managed by the justice ministry and is meant to be used to support victims of crime, as well as for certain other initiatives to reduce crime or rehabilitate criminals.\n\nHowever, Ziobro was regularly accused of\u00a0[using the fund for political purposes](\u00a0and, in one case, to unlawfully\u00a0[finance the purchase of Israeli-made Pegasus spyware]( which was in turn used to\u00a0[surveil figures opposed to the PiS government](\n\nIn a series of votes last Friday evening, a majority of members of parliament approved the lifting of Ziobro\u2019s immunity for each of the 26 charges against him as well as for him to be placed in pretrial detention.\n\n\n\nZiobro denies that any misuse of the Justice Fund took place and claims that prosecutors are now pursuing him on orders of the current government as part of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d.\n\nThe current ruling coalition, which replaced PiS in power in December 2023, has made holding former PiS officials to account for alleged crimes one of its top priorities.\n\nTwo of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy justice ministers are already facing charges for alleged crimes. Last year, one of them, Marcin Romanowski,\u00a0[fled to Hungary](\u00a0after police in Poland issued an arrest warrant for him.\n\nHe was subsequently\u00a0[granted political asylum](\u00a0there, prompting a diplomatic dispute that resulted in Poland\u00a0[withdrawing its ambassador](\u00a0from Budapest.

Pressed by Lanz about, for example, Russia\u2019s hybrid actions against European states, Chrupalla responded that \u201cany country can be a threat to Germany\u201d.\n\n\u201cTake Poland \u2013 of course, Poland could also be a threat to us,\u201d he continued, pointing to the recent decision \u201cnot to extradite a wanted criminal, a terrorist to Germany\u201d.

Poland\u2019s economic interests differ from Germany\u2019s \u2013 just like Russia\u2019s.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in his remarks, the far-right leader also sought to provide \u201ccontext\u201d for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 by arguing that the conflict actually began as a \u201ccivil war\u201d in 2014, when \u201copposition figures were persecuted in Ukraine \\[and\\] the language of the Russian-speaking minority was targeted\u201d.\n\n\n\nChrupalla\u2019s comments, including those about Poland being a threat to Germany, were quickly condemned by Roderich Kiesewetter, a politician from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), part of Germany\u2019s ruling coalition, who had been criticised by Chrupalla.\n\n\u201cTino Chrupalla\u2019s statements have shown where the AfD stands: it is a Putin club that would rather submit to a dictator than defend European and thus also German freedom,\u201d Kiesewetter told\u00a0*Frankfurter Rundschau*.\n\nIn May 2023, Chrupalla received criticism for attending a reception at the Russian embassy in Berlin for an event marking Russia\u2019s celebration of Victory Day.\n\nHe has also rejected claims that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal and last year refused, along with Weidel and other AfD figures, to attend a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the German parliament.\n\n\n\nIn Germany\u2019s parliamentary elections earlier this year, AfD emerged as the second-largest party, winning almost 21% of the vote. However, it was left in opposition after the CDU and Social Democratic Party (SPD) formed a coalition government.\n\nLast year, after elections to the European Parliament, half of MEPs from Poland\u2019s far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) party\u00a0[agreed to join](\u00a0the new European of Sovereign Nations group created by AfD.\n\nHowever, other Confederation MEPs said they refused to align with the AfD given \u201cthe statements of some members of the group, which are directly contrary to the Polish national interest\u201d.\n\nPrevious statements by leading AfD figures downplaying Nazi crimes have provoked anger in Poland.
