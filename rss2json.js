Originally, I just wanted ChatGPT to keep its tone consistent\u2014but it kept misinterpreting my scenes, flipping character arcs, or diluting emotional beats.\n\nSo I started \u201ccorrecting\u201d it.

Just a layered, text-defined logic I call MirrorProtocol.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\uddf1 Structure overview:\n\t\u2022\tModular architecture: M-CORE, M-TONE, M-ACTION, M-TRACE etc., each controlling logic, tone, behavior, response formatting\n\t\u2022\tClause-only enforcement: All output behavior is bound by natural language rules (e.g. \u201cno filler words\u201d, \u201ctone must be emotionally neutral unless softened\u201d)\n\t\u2022\tInitiation constraints: Only activates with exact invocation phrase + UUID + creator name + version stamp + full module reference\n\t\u2022\tTone modeling: Emulates a Hong Kong woman (age 30+), introspective and direct, but filtered through modular logic\n\t\u2022\tMemory logic: Includes rules for clause refinement, negative tone flagging, and structured self-correction (all prompt-based)\n\nI compiled the full structure into a whitepaper, with public reference docs in Markdown, and am considering opening it for non-commercial use under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\uddfe What I\u2019d like to ask the community:\n\t1.\tDoes this have real value in prompt engineering?
