Previously, finetuning a domain adapted BERT model would achieve an f1 score of \\~.65, however swapping out for ModernBERT, the best I can achieve is an f1 score of \\~.54.\n\nFor context, as part of my role as an analyst I partially automate thematic analysis of short text (between sentence and paragraphs). The data is pretty imbalanced and there are roughly 30 different labels with some ambiguous boundaries.\n\nI am curious if anyone is experiencing the same? Could it be the the long-short attention isn't as useful for only shorter texts?\n\nI haven't run an exhaustive hyperparameter search, but was hoping to gauge others' experience before embarking down the rabbit hole.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1i8fge8/have_you_observed_better_multilabel/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A centralized file-sharing application designed to provide secure, fast, and file transfers.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/yeonholee50/NyxHub/tree/main", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Any resource on fine-tuning for a NEW programming language ?", "summary": "thanks !", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1i8fc4s/any_resource_on_finetuning_for_a_new_programming/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Tribute to Latcho Drom: Rajasthani Folk Song and the Journey of the Romani People", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/xyr8ffj0hree1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bills fans raise over $100K for diabetes research to support Ravens player who dropped crucial pass", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/bills-fans-raise-60k-diabetes-research-support-ravens-player-dropped-c-rcna188752", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Recent Executive Orders: ACRA Analysis | American Cultural Resources Association", "summary": "", "link": "https://acra-crm.org/recent-executive-orders-acra-analysis/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gautam Adani Meets Israeli Envoy, Discusses India-Israel Collaboration", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gautam-adani-meets-israeli-envoy-reuven-azar-discusses-india-israel-collaboration-7520120", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World\u2019s oldest 3D map discovered", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.adelaide.edu.au/newsroom/news/list/2025/01/13/worlds-oldest-3d-map-discovered", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019 Star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n Becomes First Openly Trans Actor Nominated for an Oscar", "summary": "", "link": "https://variety.com/2025/awards/news/karla-sofia-gascon-oscars-first-trans-actor-nomination-1236280974/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "8 bits quantization", "summary": "Hello ,\nI wanted to know if unsloth allows a training in 8 bits? \nThx", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1i8h5xg/8_bits_quantization/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lycian Way and countless archaeological and natural sites are under threat", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.change.org/p/duble-yol-i%C3%A7in-orman%C4%B1-antik-kenleri-k%C3%B6ylerimizi-yok-etmeyin-mevcut-yolu-i%CC%87yile%C5%9Ftirin-csbgovtr-antalyabb-kasbelediye", "author": "None"}, {"title": "llmtop - A system monitor with retro AI assistant vibes (think HAL 9000 meets htop)", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/arinbjornk/llmtop/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "getip.dev: Get your IP address with an ads-free website.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/hugodeaguiar/getip.dev", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More than 2,400 aid trucks enter Gaza under truce, UN says no big looting issues", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-897-aid-trucks-entered-gaza-tuesday-2025-01-21/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The largest theft in Europe", "summary": "", "link": "https://mailchi.mp/kyivindependent.com/become-a-member-of-the-kyiv-independent-17588690?e=938fefbf67", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Millions of dollars in Lehigh Valley residents' medical debt is gone, thanks to a group of churches", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/local-news/millions-of-dollars-in-lehigh-valley-residents-medical-debt-is-gone-thanks-to-a-group-of-churches?utm_source=piano&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pm-nl&amp;pnespid=7OZ7UHVMbbpGyOjNt2uuF87W4xGqTMNyNei5nfdk9BBmZfFOIhPXiSo.6InXATP4zUp35wjUJw", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani Plans World\u2019s Biggest Data Center in India\u2019s Gujarat - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/billionaire-mukesh-ambani-plans-world-s-biggest-data-center-in-india-s-gujarat?srnd=phx-india-v2&amp;embedded-checkout=true", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u201cEgypt Uncovers Ptolemaic Head from the 7th Century AD at Taposiris Magna, Alexandria.\u201d", "summary": "\nThis weeks edition of \u201cThat Belongs In A Museum.\u201d If only this statue could talk and share its story. \nI\u2019m not sure if I have seen a statue with a head this plain looking with no ornate headwear or gear.
