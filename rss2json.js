Iron*\n\n&gt;*Iron deficiency is a well-known contributor to RLS. Low iron levels can disrupt dopamine production, which is crucial for muscle movement regulation. It's advisable to check your ferritin levels with your GP before starting supplementation. (*[*Health*](\n\n&gt;*2. Magnesium*\n\n&gt;*Magnesium plays a vital role in nerve and muscle function. Studies have shown that magnesium supplementation can reduce the severity of RLS symptoms and improve sleep quality. (*[*PMC*](\n\n&gt;*3. Vitamin B6*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin B6 supports neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine. Supplementation has been associated with alleviation of RLS symptoms. (*[*Real Simple*]( [*Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements*](\n\n&gt;*4. Vitamin B12*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve health. Deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms, including those resembling RLS. (*[*Health*]( [*Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements*](\n\n&gt;*5. Folate (Vitamin B9)*\n\n&gt;*Folate deficiency has been linked to RLS, particularly in pregnant women. Ensuring adequate levels may help manage symptoms. (*[*Wikipedia*](\n\n&gt;*6. Vitamin D*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin D deficiency is common in individuals with RLS. Supplementation may alleviate symptoms, especially in those with confirmed low levels. (*[*Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements*]( [*Healthline*](\n\n&gt;*7. Vitamins C &amp; E*\n\n&gt;*These antioxidants may help reduce oxidative stress, which is thought to play a role in RLS. Supplementation has shown benefits in certain populations.*\n\n&gt;*8. Potassium*\n\n&gt;*While not directly linked to RLS, potassium is essential for muscle function. Ensuring adequate intake may support overall muscle health.*\n\n&gt;*\ud83d\uded2 Recommended Products Available in the UK*\n\n&gt;*Here are some products that align with the above recommendations:*\n\n&gt;[*Spatone 100% Natural Iron Supplement*]( *\u00a38.08*\n\n&gt;[*Nutrition Geeks Magnesium Glycinate 3-in-1 Complex*]( *\u00a39.99*\n\n&gt;[*Nutrition Geeks 365 Tablets (Vitamin B6)*]( *\u00a38.99*\n\n&gt;[*Nature's Bounty Vitamin B-12*]( *\u00a312.06*\n\n&gt;[*Life Extension High Potency Optimized Folate*]( *\u00a310.60*\n\n&gt;[*Solgar Vitamin D3*]( *\u00a38.96*\n\n&gt;[*Solgar Vitamin C with Rose Hips*]( *\u00a311.99*\n\n&gt;[*Solgar Vitamin E*]( *\u00a312.95*\n\n&gt;[*Comdiet Potassium Capsules*]( *\u00a358.80*\n\n&gt;*\u2705 Summary of Top Picks*\n\n&gt;*Iron:* [*Spatone 100% Natural Iron Supplement*]( *\u2013 Gentle on the stomach and easily absorbed.*\n\n&gt;*Magnesium:* [*Nutrition Geeks Magnesium Glycinate 3-in-1 Complex*]( *\u2013 Combines magnesium glycinate, citrate, and oxide for comprehensive support.*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin B6:* [*Nutrition Geeks 365 Tablets*]( *\u2013 High-potency B6 to support neurotransmitter synthesis.(*[*PubMed*](\n\n&gt;*Vitamin B12:* [*Nature's Bounty Vitamin B-12*]( *\u2013 Supports nerve health and energy metabolism.(*[*Health*](\n\n&gt;*Folate:* [*Life Extension High Potency Optimized Folate*]( *\u2013 Provides bioavailable folate to support neurological function.*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin D:* [*Solgar Vitamin D3*]( *\u2013 Supports bone health and immune function.*\n\n&gt;*Vitamins C &amp; E:* [*Solgar Vitamin C with Rose Hips*]( *and* [*Solgar Vitamin E*]( *\u2013 Antioxidant support to reduce oxidative stress.*\n\n&gt;*Potassium:* [*Comdiet Potassium Capsules*]( *\u2013 Supports muscle function and nerve transmission.(*[*Verywell Health*](\n\n&gt;*\u26a0\ufe0f Important Considerations*\n\n&gt;*Consultation: Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially considering your recent lymph node removal.*\n\n&gt;*Dosage: Adhere to recommended dosages to avoid potential side effects.*\n\n&gt;*Monitoring: Regular blood tests can help monitor nutrient levels and adjust supplementation as needed.*\n\n&gt;*If you need further assistance or have specific preferences (e.g., vegan-friendly, allergen-free), feel free to ask!*\n\nIf possible, how can we get the OpenWebUI responses more 'complete' like the ChatGPT responses?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1kuyjwa/how_to_matchget_more_similar_responses_between/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Do we actually spend more time prompting AI than actually coding?", "summary": "I sat down to build a quick script, should\u2019ve taken maybe 15 to 20 minutes.

Originally built for my personal use-case (I'm lazy at prompting) then I decided to make it public for free. I'm planning to keep it always-free and would love your feedback on this :)\n\nWhy PromptJesus?\n\n* **Advanced Optimization:**\u00a0Automatically applies best practices (context setting, role definitions, chain-of-thought, few-shot prompting, and error prevention). This would be extremely useful for vibe coding purposes to turn your simple one-line prompts into comprehensive system prompts. Especially useful for lazy people like me.\n* **Customization:**\u00a0Fine-tune parameters like temperature, top-p, repetition penalty, token limits, and choose between llama models.\n* **Prompt Sharing &amp; Management:**\u00a0Generate shareable links, manage prompt history, and track engagement.\n\nPromptJesus is 100% free with no registration, hidden costs, or usage limits (Im gonna regret this lmao). Ideal for beginners looking to optimize their prompts and experts aiming to streamline workflow.\n\nLet me know your thoughts and feedback.
