Jarboe,\u00a0*Indian Soldiers in World War I: Race and Representation in an Imperial War*\u00a0(New Delhi: Speaking Tiger, 2025), 4-11.\n\n**India and the War**\n\nWhen people spoke in 1914 of the \"Great War,\" they were trying to capture something of its intensity and reach. All the war\u2019s major combatants were imperial powers, and the British, French, Belgians, and Germans had overseas possessions. War between the European powers therefore meant a war of global dimensions\u2014one that invariably favored Britain and its allies, or so the London press boasted. \"When the illimitable resources of the British Empire, our grand Fleet, our unconquerable Army, the flower of the manhood of these islands, our heroic kinsmen from overseas, our chivalrous Indian troops, are all placed in the scale in this mighty struggle from which we will never flinch nor falter, who can doubt what the end will be?\" newspapers such as the Times liked to boast. And while the German Army spent most of the war proving that economic determinism is a poor predictor of battlefield outcomes, Britain\u2019s and France\u2019s reservoir of imperial resources (when combined with the industrial capacity of the United States) did help their armies outlast those of the enemy. Franz Schauwecker, darling of Germany\u2019s postwar radical Right, described the situation just one month before his country\u2019s defeat in 1918: \"More than six and a half million French, English, American, Belgian and Italian soldiers now stand along the front. Every month, three hundred thousand fresh Americans arrive in France, as do nearly as many colored soldiers from France\u2019s colonies. Along with these men arrive seven thousand tanks and countless guns, mortars, machineguns, planes, balloons, and grenades.\" World War I ended with the sudden and stunning collapse of three great empires\u2014 those of the Hohenzollerns, Habsburgs, and the Ottoman sultans (the empire of the Romanovs, Britain\u2019s ally, fell in 1917). The peace settlements secured for the British and French the expansion of their empires into the Middle East and Africa.\n\nIt may be helpful to clarify that when people talked about \"India\" in 1914, they were referring to a landmass much greater than what we would today point to on the map. They had in mind an entire subcontinent, represented now by independent India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar (formerly Burma). Two- thirds of this massive landmass and its three hundred million people comprised British India, a sprawling colonial holding. British India\u2019s subjects lived under the direct rule of the British autocracy, known as the Raj. The one-third of India not under direct British rule was governed by hereditary monarchs, called \"princes\" for ease of reference. Great Britain\u2019s King George V was also India\u2019s king-emperor in 1914, but real power rested with the prime minister (Herbert Asquith from 1908 to 1916, and David Lloyd George from 1916 until 1922) and his cabinet at 10 Downing Street. The prime minister delegated the tasks of governing British India to his secretary of state for India, a cabinet- level post (which meant he did the job of governing India from London), and the governor-general in British India, known as the viceroy, who headed the Government of India (he did this work from his office in Delhi).\n\nThe Indian Army was the (British) Government of India\u2019s professional, all- volunteer garrison, paid for by the Indian taxpayer. In 1914 it comprised South Asians\u2014 drawn mainly from British India with a share of Gurkhas from Nepal, and Pashtuns, or Pathans, from the volatile North- West Frontier Province, what is now the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan\u2014 and British Army regulars on rotation from the Home Army of the British Isles. The Indian Army\u2019s units were of two kinds, combatant and noncombatant. Combatant Indian infantrymen (foot soldiers) were spoken of as \"sepoys\" and Indian cavalrymen (horse soldiers) as \"sowars.\" Sepoys served in all-Indian battalions of anywhere from 750 to 1,000 men, led exclusively by British officers. An infantry brigade in 1914 typically comprised three battalions of Indian infantry and one British. An Indian division might have anywhere from 10,000 to 12,000 combatant soldiers, divided between three brigades. There were 159,134 Indians serving in the ranks of the Indian Army as combatants in August 1914. There were 34,767 more in the reserves. Another 45,660 Indians served as noncombatants, sometimes called \"followers.\" Altogether, these 239,561 men served alongside 76,953 British soldiers.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1919 another 1,440,437 Indians joined the Indian Army, 877,068 as combatants and 563,369 as noncombatants, a contribution in manpower exceeding those made by any and all of Britain\u2019s other colonies or dominions to the imperial war effort. Indian soldiers deployed to three continents and at any given time belonged to one of the seven expeditionary forces India sent overseas during the war\u2014to France and Belgium (Indian Expeditionary Force A, or IEFA); to East Africa (IEFB and IEFC); to Mesopotamia (IEFD); to the Sinai and Palestine (IEFE and IEFF); to Gallipoli (IEFG); and other theaters.\n\nJust before the outbreak of war in August 1914, the Government of India had warned that any overseas deployment of Indian Army soldiers (Indian and British) above and beyond three infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade might precipitate domestic turbulence and instability. Nevertheless, the army had sent some 23,500 British and 78,000 Indian ranks abroad by Christmas 1914\u2014far beyond the recommended limit. By that date Indian soldiers had already secured oil interests in Basra in the Persian Gulf, assaulted beachheads in East Africa, participated in the capture of Tsingtao in China, and helped absorb the brunt of the German attack on the Western Front.\n\nBetween October 1914 and the close of 1915, when commanders redeployed the infantry for the growing war in the Middle East, Indian soldiers belonging to IEFA fought for control of villages and towns up and down the British sector of the Western Front: Ypres, Festubert, Givenchy, Neuve Chapelle, Second Ypres, and Loos. In the Middle East, Indian Army operations began in earnest in November 1914 when the Indian 6th Division deployed to Basra in the Persian Gulf to secure the oil fields in nearby Abadan, in neutral Persia. Some 4,700 soldiers readily overwhelmed the Ottoman shore battery and garrison.\n\nAt the same time, an Indian force gathered in Egypt to protect the Suez Canal, Britain\u2019s lifeline to Asia. In January 1915 well-entrenched and well-provisioned Indian troops repulsed a Turkish attack on the Canal. They then assisted a slow and careful advance into the Sinai desert, improving rail lines, digging wells, and laying water pipes to ensure that any offensives launched from the region would enjoy reliable access to drinking water. Additional brigades of infantry from India and another from Egypt joined the 6th Division in Basra in March 1915, where reports of an approaching Ottoman force alarmed Indian Army Command. General John Nixon took command of a force now 20,000 strong. In April his men repulsed an Ottoman attack at Shaiba, ensuring the British war machine\u2019s uninterrupted access to the oil upon which it relied.\n\nThen in 1916 Turkey redoubled its efforts to capture the Suez Canal. Empire soldiers fought a series of back-and-forth battles in the Sinai desert. Otherwise very little territory changed hands, and the Suez Canal remained safely guarded.\n\nIndian Army operations in Mesopotamia ultimately proved to be the army\u2019s most tortuous and tragic. In late summer 1915 IEFD began a slow advance up the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers into the heart of Mesopotamia. General Nixon\u2019s victory against Turkish forces at Kut on the Tigris in late September opened the hundred-mile road to Baghdad. At a time in the war when very little was going the Allies\u2019 way (the Germans remained lodged in France; the Turks held the high ground at Gallipoli), the capture and occupation of the city became a pressing priority. The viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge\u2014who had exclaimed when he learned of Nixon\u2019s victory at Kut, \"I hope to be the Pasha of Baghdad before I leave India!\"\u2014persuaded the British cabinet that the two Indian divisions fighting in France were needed more in the Middle East. Yet British ambitions met reality when Turkish forces checked the advancing Indian 6th Division south of Baghdad at Ctesiphon in November 1915, and the division\u2019s commander, General Charles Townshend, ordered a hasty retreat to Kut. About thirteen thousand Indian and British soldiers dug in and withstood a siege until starvation forced their surrender in April 1916, a defeat, in Townsend\u2019s own estimation, comparable to Cornwallis\u2019s at Yorktown in 1781.9\u00a0Hastily conceived rescue operations that winter produced thousands of additional casualties unnecessarily.\n\nFortune smiled brighter on Indian Army soldiers in the Middle East in the war\u2019s final two years, when the Indian Army became a formidable army of conquest. Reorganized, reequipped, and under new leadership, it punched its way through the Turkish lines and captured Baghdad in March 1917. An empire force under the command of the hard-fighting Edmund Allenby set out from Egypt to commence the invasion of Palestine. In November, his soldiers took Gaza. In December, empire soldiers captured Jerusalem, a victory heralded by one Indian newspaper as \u201cthe greatest event in the history of the world.\u201d The Indian Expeditionary Force D (IEFD) mopped up remaining Turkish forces in what is now northern Iraq.\n\nMeanwhile, when the Allied Supreme War Council convened at the start of 1918, it tasked the Indian Army with knocking Turkey out of the war before the close of the year. Command set its sights on Aleppo in Syria, a distance of some three hundred miles from the empire force in Palestine. Indian soldiers fought that summer for control of the Jordan Valley. In September, they broke through Turkish defenses at Megiddo. Indian cavalry soldiers, who had spent more time in France in the trenches than in the saddle, now put their mounts to good effect and exploited the breach. Allenby\u2019s pursuit led to the capture of Damascus, Beirut, and Aleppo in rapid succession. The Turks agreed to an armistice on October 30, 1918.\n\nAt war\u2019s end, more than half a million men were serving overseas with the Indian Army. Between 1914 and 1918, the Indian Army sent some 1,096,013 soldiers overseas, 621,224 of them in a combat role. Bullets and exploding shells claimed the lives of 53,486 men; 64,350 Indians came home wounded. Indian soldiers collected more than twelve thousand decorations. A dozen men received the Victoria Cross, the British Empire\u2019s highest military honor for \u201cgallantry of the highest order.\u201d\n\nBut not every soldier had remained loyal throughout\u2014\u201ctrue to his salt,\u201d to use an expression common among the troops. When Turkey joined the war in October 1914, the Ottoman sultan proclaimed a jihad and called on Britain\u2019s Muslim subjects to cast off the yoke of British rule. Backed by the German government, Indian radicals and propagandists headquartered in Berlin had, from the earliest months of the war, exhorted Indian soldiers to murder their English officers. A global network of Indian revolutionaries inspired some soldiers stationed in South Asia in 1915 to mutiny. Some soldiers participated in a rebellion by tribesmen in the North-West Frontier Province, a region seething under the yoke of racial violence and colonial rule. Two dozen soldiers serving in France in 1915 deserted to the German lines, hoping that Turkey\u2019s ally, the kaiser, might provide them safe passage home to the North-West Frontier Province. A few actually made it, by way of a German-led expedition that sought to bribe the emir of Afghanistan into invading British India. A dozen of these deserters only got as far as northern Persia before British agents caught up with them. One soldier, with his German wife and their infant son in tow, returned safely to Afghanistan in 1921 by way of civil war\u2013torn Russia (the Indian Army, it is worth stating, recruited a limited number of men from Afghanistan). Another small batch of Indian soldiers, captured by the Germans in France, reenlisted in the Ottoman Army in 1916 and deployed to the Middle East to fight against the Indian Army.\n\nMost Indian soldiers demobilized peaceably after the war. Those that remained in uniform reequipped and redeployed for the tried-and-tested prewar practice of policing the empire\u2019s volatile holdings east of the Suez Canal\u2014to Iraq, for example, or the Afghan border. Others deployed to cities and towns in India where they suppressed Gandhi\u2019s first nationwide campaign of civil disobedience, or satyagraha, in March and April 1919. Indian soldiers fired on crowds in Delhi on March 30. Two weeks later, troops fired on demonstrators in Amritsar and Lahore in the Punjab, and in Ahmedabad in the presidency of Bombay. Indian troops also gunned down Indian civilians in Calcutta and Bombay. At the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, commander of the Jullundur Brigade of the Indian Army, ordered a detachment of Indian soldiers under his command to fire into a crowd of 20,000 people. The soldiers fired more than 1,600 rounds, killing 379 people and wounding more than 1,000 others.\n\nThe events of March and April 1919 were decisive. At the start of the war, Gandhi had been a supporter of the empire. He wrote a letter to the Times in 1914 in which he urged Indians to support the war effort in any way they could, that they \u201cshare the responsibilities of membership of this great Empire, if we would share its privileges.\u201d After Amritsar, Gandhi considered it \u201cthe duty of every Indian soldier\u2026 to sever his connection with the Government,\u201d and that it was \u201ccontrary to national dignity\u201d for any Indian to serve as a soldier for a government \u201cwhich has brought about India\u2019s economic, moral and political degradation and which has used the soldiery\u2026 for repressing national aspirations.\u201d\n\nIndian troops, who safeguarded British imperial holdings and spearheaded British imperial ambitions overseas during the war, squashed Indian national aspirations at home in the immediate aftermath of the war. The events of March and April 1919, more than anything else, propelled Gandhi to the forefront of Indian national politics. In 1920, the Indian National Congress abandoned its long-standing position as Britain\u2019s \u201cloyal opponent\u201d in favor of a stance intended to undermine British rule by means of non-cooperation and extralegal resistance.\n\nIn both Great Britain and India, the topic of \u201cIndia and the War\u201d became an industry unto itself during the war years. In 1914 and 1915, newspapers in England regaled readers with the exploits of the Indian troops fighting just across the English Channel. Headlines like \u201cIndian Troops in Action,\u201d \u201cDash of the Indian Troops,\u201d and \u201cValour of the Indian Troops\u201d gave audiences reason for optimism at a time when the war\u2019s outcome remained uncertain. Penny pamphlets written by members of the Indian National Congress reassured people that India was with Britain \u201cHeart and Soul.\u201d Propaganda films taught schoolchildren that those were their Indian soldiers fighting in the trenches. In Madras, G. A. Natesan &amp; Co. offered India\u2019s newly emerging professional and educated classes\u00a0*The Indian Review War Book.*\u00a0Avowedly nationalist in its bent, Natesan\u2019s collection of essays and speeches were nonetheless pro-war and pro-empire.\n\nThe war\u2019s first histories appeared on bookshelves even as the war raged. Official histories hit the market in the 1920s. British officers who served in the Indian Army on various fronts produced one account after another, many of them self-serving. General James Willcocks said of the accomplishments of the Indian troops under his command in IEFA, \u201cNo one knows better than I do how utterly impossible it would have been for them to do what they did, without the help and example of their illustrious comrades of the Scottish, Irish, and English battalions which formed part of each brigade.\u201d\n\nIndian Army veteran and historian Rana Chhina recently described this first generation of histories as narratives \u201cshaped by the victors in the metropole and passed on to the colonies for uncritical adoption. These hollow narratives endured for as long as the colonial powers that generated them held sway.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of a second and far more destructive world war and the end of British rule in India, the subject of \u201cIndia and the \\[First World\\] War\u201d was all but \u201cconsigned to the dustbins of history,\u201d forgotten in England and forgotten in the newly independent South Asian nations. Students of World War I lost sight of the war\u2019s global and imperial dimensions. Where World War II generated an official Indian history, World War I did not. At the time of the war\u2019s eightieth anniversary in the 1990s, only a handful of titles had been added to the corpus.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ku8jl9/indian_soldiers_in_the_great_war/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "3,800-Year-Old Wooden Wedge Unearthed in Canada: Rare \u201cWet Site\u201d Discovery Sheds Light on Ancient Daily Life", "summary": "", "link": "https://ancientist.com/2025/05/24/3800-year-old-wooden-wedge-unearthed-in-canada-rare-wet-site-discovery-sheds-light-on-ancient-daily-life/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mobile Prompt Management Software Feature Suggestions\u200e", "summary": "\nI recently developed an iOS prompt management app called PromptFlow to help users better organize and utilize AI prompts.
