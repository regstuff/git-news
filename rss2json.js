Think of it like **Figma meets Google Docs**, but for transcription.\n\n# \ud83c\udfa7\u00a0 Why I Built This?\n\nA while ago, I went through a personal situation, multiple items were stolen from me during a garage sale by ex close-friend of mine in Vancouver. While going back and forth with this person I started recording our conversations to build a strong case of the situation and as police evidence. However, I needed to **analyze and transcribe long recordings one by one** to help piece together details. But the tools I found were either:\n\n* too expensive for multi-hour files,\n* not accurate enough with real-world, noisy audio,\n* or too locked-down to let me edit or reprocess the data how I needed.\n\nWhisper gave me a solid transcription base, but I quickly realized there was **no tool that let me edit transcripts comfortably** across long audios, with speaker diarization, versioning, or collaboration, especially not on a budget.\n\nSo I started building **VerbaticAI**, with the goal of making **accurate, editable, and affordable transcription accessible** to everyone.\n\n# \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Who I Am\n\nI\u2019m a **Computer Science graduate**, and currently working as an SDE at one of the largest financial institutions in the US.

Lets see if we can solve some of these problems here.\n\nHere they are...\n\n1. Overloaded Context Many prompts try to include too much backstory or task information at once, leading to token dilution. This overwhelms the model and causes it to generalize instead of focusing on actionable elements.\n2. Lack of Role Framing Failing to assign a specific role or persona leaves the model in default mode, which is prone to bland or uncertain responses. Role assignment gives context boundaries and creates behavioral consistency.\n3. Mixed Instruction Layers When you stack multiple instructions (e.g., tone, format, content) in the same sentence, the model often prioritizes the wrong one. Layering your prompt step-by-step produces more reliable results.\n4. Ambiguous Objectives Prompts that don't clearly state what success looks like will lead to wandering or overly cautious outputs. Always anchor your prompt to a clear goal or outcome.\n5. Conflicting Tone or Format Signals Asking for both creativity and strict structure, or brevity and elaboration, creates contradictions. The AI will try to balance both and fail at both unless one is clearly prioritized.\n6. Repetitive Anchor Language Repeating key instructions multiple times may seem safe, but it actually causes model drift or makes the output robotic. Redundancy should be used for logic control, not paranoia.\n7. No Fail-Safe Clause Without permission to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cinsufficient data,\u201d the model will guess \u2014 and often hallucinate. Including uncertainty clauses leads to better boundary-respecting behavior.\n8. Misused Examples Examples are powerful but easily backfire when they contradict the task or are too open-ended. Use them sparingly and make sure they reinforce, not confuse, the task logic.\n9. Absence of Output Constraints Without specifying format (e.g., bullet list, JSON, dialogue), you leave the model to improvise \u2014 often in unpredictable ways. Explicit output formatting keeps results modular and easy to parse.\n10. No Modular Thinking Prompts written as walls of text are harder to maintain and reuse.

China beats the USA in 57 fields (out of 64), and in 7 fields the USA ranks first. In 8 fields India beats the US and is ranked second after China. At the current rate, in one of these technologies, we will rank first in the coming years after dethroning China.\n\nWhere precisely, does India stand? In which technologies? Who is doing all this research? Where in India? And, finally. Why does it not feel like we are number 3?\n\nThis is a first in a series of posts (idk how many) trying to explore the answers to these questions. I will try to write in a way that is as easy to understand as possible, and keep it accessible. For those of you who need more, please see the next section.\n\n# More\n\n**Data:** This post is based on data generated by Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), who have since 2023 maintained a database about scientific research in certain critical strategic technologies. They measure which country contributed how much to the top research in that technology. \\[ [1](  , [2](  \\] Their work is free to view at the [website]( \\[3\\].\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** ASPI is not responsible for the content of this post, especially in how I present their data, or any opinions included in this post.\n\n**Details:** This post will be short and to-the-point. For references, methodology, list of all technologies, what content will be covered in the next post in this series, and other meta discussion like volunteering, please refer to my [zeroth post]( Remember to read ASPI\u2019s original reports at [1](  , [2]( , and visit their [website]( \\[3\\].\n\n**Technologies:** Please visit [ASPI\u2019s website to see the full list of technologies]( I have made an attempt to create a visual mind map in the figure below. Hope it helps. Detailed discussion on technologies is for a later post.\n\n[Figure 1A: The 64 technologies tracked by ASPI, that are referenced in this post. A visual mind-map to help. Details you can look up yourself at https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/list-of-technologies\\/.](\n\n# Basics\n\nWhenever a scientist publishes new research, they are usually building on top of previously published science. To make it easy for you to find this older research, scientists \u201creference\u201d or \u201ccite\u201d these older papers.\n\nInfluential research is usually cited by lots of new research papers. So, if your research has been cited so many times that it comes under top-10% by citations in your field, then you have probably published good quality research. For this post, research in the top-10% by citation number is considered \u201chighly cited research\u201d. Countries can be judged by how much their researchers collectively contribute to highly cited research in any given technology.\n\nWhat if a scientist writes only one great research paper in their lifetime, but has a mediocre career otherwise? They might have a high number of citations, but lack consistency. The Hirsch index (h-index) avoids this issue. If a scientist has an h-index of 25, it means they have published 25 papers that were cited at least 25 times. This is a much harder score to beat, because one-off lucky breaks do not count. You have to show consistency and quality.\n\nTo give a top-level overview, in this post I have at times averaged a country\u2019s percentage contribution across all 64 technologies. This assumes (for one) that all 64 technologies are equally important, which might not be correct. I have not done this with h-index, since you can\u2019t compare h-index across technologies. A great h-index in one field might be a terrible h-index in another field. You can\u2019t just average.\n\n# All Published Research, 2019-2023\n\n[Figure 1B: Percentage contribution by country and region for all published research in the Web of Science under the 64 technologies during the 5 years span of 2019 to 2023. Percentage contributions to each technology first calculated, then averaged. Data from https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/. More details in the zeroth post.](\n\nNational / regional shares (in percentage points) in research output across all the 64 technologies are averaged, and the final number (in percentage points) is shown in the chart. This gives all 64 technologies equal weightage.\n\nClearly China has an overwhelming advantage, all on its own. This is not even considering the many journal publications not included in this study because these regional journals may not have been included in the Web of Science (a database of quality journals).\n\nIndia ranks 3rd by country, the US second. Considering the cooperation between the Five Eyes Anglosphere (like in AUKUS) and within the Eurosphere (EU), these blocs as a whole are far more competitive against China than on their own. If there were to be a similar East Asian bloc of democracies, it would put India at 5th place in terms of bloc-wise contribution to research. The other main non-negligible contributor in South Asia is Pakistan, so a bloc enlargement to include neighbours doesn\u2019t help India. Yet, alone, India holds ground.\n\n# Highly Cited Research, 2019-2023\n\n[Figure 1C: Percentage contribution by country and region in each of the 64 technologies, but only the top 10&amp;#37; highly cited research in each technology is considered, during the 2019 to 2023 5 year period. Percentage contribution in each technology calculated, and then the average across technologies is as in figure. More in my zeroth post. Data from https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/.](\n\nThe general national rankings hold true when we limit ourselves to only highly cited research. So, at the national level, China ranks 1st, USA 2nd, and India 3rd in terms of not only quantity of publications, but also by share in quality research. At the regional level, the top 4 (China, Anglosphere, Eurosphere, East Asia) retain their ranks, but India slips behind West Asia to rank 6th. There seems to be a loss in India\u2019s standing when we start to focus on quality, and not just quantity.\n\nThere is a drop in terms of percentage points in the shares of many countries &amp; regions. East Asia loses a quarter of its points (Korea loses a seventh, Japan nearly halves), India loses a fifth of its points, and the Eurosphere loses a seventh of its points. Latin America\u2019s points halve, and Eurasia\u2019s (led by Russia) loses far more of its share.\n\nChina not only maintains its share, but gains. As do the Anglosphere, West Asia, SE Asia, and North Africa. But China\u2019s gains are the most dramatic. Some of this might be attributable to Chinese authors disproportionately citing more researchers from China rather than other countries i.e. [parochial citations]( which is bound to happen once you consistently publish large amounts of research in a country. Some of this could also be research malpractice \\[ [4]( [5]( \\]. Regardless of these nitpicks, the Chinese dominance in publishing quality research is undeniable.\n\nIt is worth taking another look at how India loses points as we change our focus from quantity to quality. For the moment, let us disregard countries publishing large volumes of research, since [parochial citation practices]( might be a factor. While we may not be able to emulate richer countries like Singapore &amp; Saudi Arabia who gain points, it says something about our research that we lose points whereas Egypt and Pakistan don\u2019t. Judging scientists simply by the number of papers published might have unintended counter-effects such as this. It will force them to publish sub-par papers just for the sake of publishing. The focus should rather be on investing in quality research outcomes, however that can be accomplished.\n\nYet, India holds ground. Our ratio of quantity to quality can be improved, but even as it stands currently, we are in the game. This becomes even more evident when you take a look at [who is in the top 5 in each technology]( Most technology-level discussion is left for a future post in this series.\n\n# Rankings, by Highly Cited Research, 2019-2023\n\n[Figure 1D: Rankings of countries and regions during the 2019 to 2023 period, based on their contribution to top 10&amp;#37; highly cited research in each technology. Think of it as Olympics, each competition a technology. Only that we are also giving medals to the 4th and 5th place rankers. Data from https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/.](\n\nHaving an overall high score might hide some things. What if a country is extremely good in only one sector, which leads them to having a high share in global highly cited research? They are not really a full-fledged research power then. Their expertise is narrow.\n\nFor each of the 64 technologies, ASPI ranked countries based on their contributions to highly cited research in 2019 to 2023. Based on these rankings, you can see how China\u2019s dominance in research is not limited to any specific sector. As is USA\u2019s research - the US is really good across all technologies, even if not the best. In 57 of these technologies, China takes the gold medal, and loses the gold medal to the USA in the remaining 7 technologies. The 57 of China\u2019s golds have the USA as the silver-medal runner-up in only 49 technologies. There are 8 technologies where the US lags not just China, but at least one other country.\n\nIndia bags 7 of these silver medals that the USA couldn\u2019t win, and South Korea bags one (supercapacitors). India\u2019s silver medals are as follows, along with what I think as the most important strategic sector they might have implications for: 17%, biofuels (energy), 16%, mesh and infrastructure independent networks (communications), 13%, high specification machining processes (manufacturing), 11%, advanced composite materials (defense), 10%, biological manufacturing (health), 10%, distributed ledgers (cybersecurity), 8%, smart materials (defense)\n\nTo most of you, this will simply sound like a bundle of science-y words. Hopefully I will write about them in some detail in future posts. For the moment, I invite everyone to visit ASPI\u2019s website where they [describe these technologies]( What I personally find most striking, however, is that GoI never brings up biotechnology as a strategically important sector with security implications. A topic for another day.\n\nIndia\u2019s performance, while not as widespread as either US or China, is quite well balanced across most different technologies. India ranks in the top 5 in 45 technologies in total, which is the highest for any country other than China or the US (both rank in all 64). Having 7 silver and 24 bronze medals, India is unambiguously in top 3 in almost half of these fields. This is a remarkable achievement that, again, reinforces India\u2019s worldwide 3rd rank.\n\nThe region-level rankings, although less meaningful for the many frenemies of East &amp; West Asia, show how Europe as a whole makes enormous research contributions that are fragmented across its many countries. It is for this reason that ASPI created another [technology-wise ranking counting EU as a single group](\n\nAs a single entity, the EU ranks in all 64 technologies just as China and the US, displacing India from its 3rd rank to 4th (in terms of medals won). China would then have 56 golds, just 3 silvers, and be pushed down to 5 bronzes. The US would have 6 golds, 26 silvers, 24 bronzes. The EU 2 golds, 30 silvers, 29 bronzes. India with 46 medals now (because some countries merged into the EU) retains 4 of its silvers, and has 6 bronzes. South Korea retains its one silver medal. No other country breaks into the top 3 for any technology.\n\n# Rankings, by H-Index, 2019 - 2023\n\n[Figure 1E: Rankings of countries and regions based on their h-index \\(Hirsch index, read more in my zeroth post\\) in each technology, for the 5 year period between 2019 and 2023. Sort of like the Olympics, if 4th and 5th place also had medals.  Data from https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/.](\n\nOn to consistency. A country\u2019s ranking could just be because of just one-off great publications. Lucky breaks. Can a country produce quality publications consistently?\n\nChina slips a bit when asked this question. It still ranks in all technologies, now with only 49 golds, 15 silvers. The US bags the remaining 15 golds, 45 silvers, and gets bronzes for the last 4 technologies (no fourths, an improvement).\n\nUK now has the third most medals (40), 14 of them bronzes. No silver. India has 34 medals (lost 11), holds on to 3 silvers, 10 bronzes. South Korea retains its silver, gains bronzes (now 9) to now have 28 medals in all. Germany, also with 28, has the same bronzes as before.\n\nThe h-index is revealing. The US, the UK, South Korea, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Singapore, Egypt, Spain, and even Russia do not slip in the rankings. Instead, they rise. Taiwan holds on to its single medal, neither rising nor falling. On the other hand, China, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, France, Turkey, Algeria, Malaysia and Austria all stumble.\n\nOn the surface, this seems to suggest that the Global North, so to speak, produces quality research more consistently. They rely less on lucky breaks with few good papers, but rather have a way to produce good research on a regular basis. Something that developing countries haven\u2019t yet replicated. Egypt, exceptionally, has a knack for producing consistent quality research (in 2 technologies). Japan, Saudi Arabia, France, and Austria are the exceptions on the opposite end - their research relies more on lucky breaks, like in India or China. For the old guard like Japan and France, this seems to be in line with the general trend of their year-on-year reduced contribution to quality research. More in a future post.\n\nIndia\u2019s overall contributions to quality research, however significant, are slightly dampened by this lack of consistency. Still, India at worst ranks 4th. With consistent contributions in at least half the technologies, and bagging silver medals over Britain\u2019s sunset empire.\n\nH-index is a number that builds with time. Say two countries are analysed during a 5 year period, and both countries publish several papers with the total number of citations equal. The country that published more papers in the first or second year, even if these papers were mediocre, will have a higher H-index than the country that published more highly cited papers in the fifth year. Because the earlier papers had more time to gather citations, regardless of its quality. So, if a country has accelerated its quality research output in the fourth or fifth year, it might rank lower in the h-index rankings despite having higher ranks in highly cited research. India\u2019s output has indeed accelerated exponentially in recent years, and this might be why it still has not gathered h-index numbers that match its significant quality research output. India\u2019s historical publication trajectory is for another post.\n\nRegardless. The fact stands that India\u2019s contribution has not been as consistent over the recent five years as, say, the UK. This is an area that needs improvement. Reputation takes time to build. Without demonstrating consistent output for a long period of time, we cannot expect to be taken as seriously as a science and technology power.\n\n# Highly Cited Research, 2003 - 2023\n\n[Figure 1F: Percentage contributions of countries and regions for the 21 year duration of 2003 to 2023, to the top 10&amp;#37; highly cited research in each technology. Cumulative percentage contributions in each field are calculated, and then averaged. Read more in the zeroth post. Data from https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/.](\n\nThe figure above summarises the total share of research by country and region in highly cited papers over 21 years. China\u2019s rise has been so dramatic that it has made a major dent even in the cumulative worldwide contribution over 21 years, ranking as the top contributor over the two decades. The US comes next, then the UK, then Germany, then India at 5th, followed by Japan, Italy, France, Korea, Canada, Australia, and so on.\n\nComparing this figure with the previous one for recent highly cited research, you notice how sharp India\u2019s rise has been. To be able to contribute to 4.9% of highly cited research recently when for two decades it only had a 3.7% share cumulatively. Similar comparisons show how the Western countries have lost ground. South Korea, to its credit, has increased its share marginally over its historical cumulative average. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t compare against China's (+44%) or India\u2019s (+34%) growth stories.\n\nHistory has baggage. A commanding early lead has repercussions into the future, even if your country\u2019s recent research output has slowed. It takes 20 years for a patent to die out. On the other end, it takes time to build. Singapore took 20 years to grow research talent, worldwide partnerships, and reputation, and then attract worldwide talent. It takes a decade to build institutions, research labs, large scientific projects, to slow brain-drain, for increased government funding to make a big impact \\[[12]( India\u2019s growth spurt is only recent, and it will take time for it to gain the commanding heights commensurate with its recent research output.\n\n# Opinion\n\nSo many of these numbers, the top ranked countries, remind me of the country rankings by nominal GDP. India is projected to have become the 4th largest economy by GDP as per [IMF\u2019s 2025 projections]( with a GDP of $4.2 trillion. German GDP would be just $4.7 trillion, but China would be at $19.2 trillion, and the US at $30.5 trillion. Being ranked fourth is little comfort when we lag by an order of magnitude. India\u2019s share in quality research is similarly just 4.9%, despite being ranked 3rd, a long way behind USA\u2019s 14.6% and China\u2019s 38.8%.\n\nShould we really pride ourselves in our standing?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care about pride. I care about doing better. If pride pushes us to it, great. If anxiety about lagging spurs us on, let\u2019s get anxious. We should have enough self-respect to not be despondent. As long as we remember we are in a race, not a WhatsApp story. Research isn\u2019t timepass, it makes nations. Need we be reminded by our adversaries?\n\nRanking 3rd is great, but 5% doesn\u2019t cut it. We are a sixth of humanity, we should stake a claim to that share.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAt the national level, India unambiguously ranks next after China and the US as a scientific power, in terms of both quantity and quality. Maybe because India is new to this, and also because it has a problem of quantity over quality, consistent quality research is still a challenge for India. India's recent accelerated research output is pretty obvious even from this limited perspective. \n\nAt a bloc level, the European Union would displace India from 3rd to 4th place. EU's research power is formidable, albeit fragmented across nations. For India, however, a regional bloc would not really help improve its standing.\n\nHigh ranking notwithstanding, India's share is shy of 5%, and there is a lot of room for improvement in quantity, quality, and consistency. How this can be achieved is an open question, one I hope to explore to some extent in coming posts.\n\n# Other Posts\n\n\\[00\\] [Zeroth Post]( : References, methodology, and other details. \n\nDo visit [ .
