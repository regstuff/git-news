I don't know if I can post it, and I don't want to break the rules. We are blessed to have found a good host that offered us a year-long contract for a server and a domain, and the website has been live for a few weeks. There are three people on the team, yet we have made tremendous progress in a short amount of time.\n\nI am sharing this for a few reasons:\n\n1. I love the project. It's a ton of fun to work on, and I would use something like this project, even if I didn't work on it.\n\n2. While similar to other websites/services (GoodReads, for example), it has an emphasis on community, making friends, having fun, earning rewards, and competing with others. It's not a database, though it has one. It is not a social medium, but it has the features for one. It is a weird mix of all sorts of stuff, and I hope you guys like it.\n\n3. We have worked hard on this, and it's pretty frustrating to have so much passion and not see anybody care. Nobody is entitled to your interest, and I am not asking for people to look at this project out of pity. I am just sharing something I have worked on, something I am really proud of, and something I really hope others enjoy.\n\n4. We need feedback, ideas, and contributions to our database. We have implemented a system for automatically grabbing data from the OpenLibrary database, importing books, and making them available for users. On the Browse Books page, if you cannot find your book, you can add it and get credit for it. No matter what you are reading, you can help us out by going to the page, typing in the ISBN, and adding the book to our database.\n\n  \nI would be overjoyed to see even one person find this site and enjoy it. If you don't like the project, that's great, too. I just ask that you tell us why, so that we can make it better. Don't hold back on criticism, but please, provide us with legitimate ideas and things to change so that we can improve.\n\nAgain, the website is live, you can register, and you can start earning points. Use it as a book tracker (which is one of the major parts of the website, anyway), add it to your home screen (iOS), and talk to us about what you think. The team is made up of three college guys, and we are definitely nervous about letting others see our work. Help us make something really special. :)\n\n  \nThank you for your time.", "link": "https://github.com/GRead-Development/GRead", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeology News for September 2025 is out!", "summary": "Features for this month are:  \nFellow YTer History with Kalyeigh reports from the field on Neolithic structures at Saybur\u00e7 in Turkey - 12,600 years old\u00a0\n\nFirst ever victim of interpersonal violence in Vietnam - 12,000 years old\n\nQuartzite workshop in Senegal - 9,000 years old\n\nPrehistoric burial ground in Bavaria - 4,000 years old\u00a0\n\nInterview with Dr. Cecilia Mauricio on the Polychrome 3D Mural at Huaca Yolanda in Peru - 4,000 years old\n\nNew version of the Canopus decree in Egypt - 2,263 years old\n\nBilingual Roman tomb inscription in Albania - 1,700 \u2013 1,800 years old\n\nInterview with Authors of \u2018Ancient Egypt in 50 Discoveries\u2019 \n\nEgyptian doctor imprisoned for smuggling\u00a0antiquities\n\nStolen Pharaoh\u2019s bracelet in Egypt melted down for gold\n\nCleopatra\u2019s Final Secret Documentary\n\n", "link": "https://youtu.be/U9luNbaM004", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI-flaschard app for language learning? Appreciate feedback!", "summary": "Hello to all,\n\nWe are planning to build with a friend an AI flaschard app that fastens, optimizes and contextualizes the vocabulary acquisition process.\n\nMost people use (including me) use Anki. For Anki, you need to insert the words, definitions, sentences, examples, etc. individually. Plus, it can get dull with written format all the time.\n\nIn this app, the user inputs X: X being any word, list of words, or scenes, like \"eating out\", \"defending an argument\", etc. Then the app generates flashcards in the format of sentences, dialogues, pictures, short stories, songs, magazine text, or podcast scripts.\n\nSo, let's say that you want to learn the word \"confusion\". You can obtain a flashcard that includes a picture, a song, and few sentences tailored to your level that include this word. The idea is to build a \"context tree\" for this word, to increase your exposure to the use in context as much as possible. (We also envision that the example sentences will include other words that the user is in the stage of learning)\n\nWhat is your first impression of such an app? Does Anki have any drawbacks, in the age of AI? Does the idea of AI-enriched flaschards sound interesting?
