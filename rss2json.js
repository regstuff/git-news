A translation of the article below:\n\n\n**The Silver Hoard with 20,000 Coins Could Be Groundbreaking**\n**2025-09-19**\n\n\u201cSometimes key finds come along that change everything \u2013 I believe this has the potential to be one of those,\u201d says Cecilia von Heijne from the Economic Museum \u2013 Royal Coin Cabinet, about the silver hoard discovered near a holiday home in Stockholm County.\n\nThe six-kilogram hoard was found in a copper cauldron by people digging for fishing worms. Cecilia von Heijne, director of the Economic Museum \u2013 Royal Coin Cabinet, has not yet seen the coins but finds them incredibly exciting and is eager to learn more.\n\n&gt; \u201cSometimes key finds come along that change everything, like our largest silver hoard from Spillings on Gotland. I believe this has the potential to be one of those,\u201d she says.\n\nThe finders reported the discovery to the County Administrative Board, as required by law for ancient finds containing precious metals. The site is now being examined by archaeologists who aim to place the find in its historical context.\n\n---\n\n**Jewelry and 20,000 Coins in the Cauldron**\n\n&gt; \u201cSince it was found in a cauldron, it\u2019s a bit like the treasure at the end of the rainbow. It doesn\u2019t appear to have been buried in a building, and we don\u2019t yet know what might be nearby. Judging by the weight, we estimate there are around 20,000 coins, but we haven\u2019t counted them yet,\u201d says antiquarian Sofia Andersson from the County Administrative Board.\n\nThe cauldron had been buried with jewelry such as brooches, pendants, rings, and silver beads, with a few gold items at the bottom and the coins placed on top. The silver coins alone weighed 4.8 kilograms. The rest included jewelry with intricate ornamentation, made using so-called filigree technique. The style suggests that some of the items are older than the coins \u2013 from the Viking Age.\n\n---\n\n**Unusual Coins from the 12th Century**\n\nAt least some of the coins bear the inscription *Kanutus*, indicating they were minted under King Knut Eriksson, who ruled in the late 12th century. Coins from that period are rare, which already makes the find significant. The Spillings Hoard and other major silver hoards are much older.\n\nSwedish coins from the 12th century are also rare because, for about 150 years, no coins were minted in Sweden \u2013 instead, coins were imported mainly from Germany and England. As recently as last year, however, silver coins from the same period were found in a grave on the island of Visings\u00f6. A similar find was made in Sk\u00e4nninge in 2014, and both had a similar composition to this newly discovered hoard.\n\nThe coin hoard, which is the largest medieval silver hoard ever found in Stockholm County, also includes Gotlandic coins and so-called bishop's coins minted in Europe.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt will be interesting to see if there are any Swedish bishop\u2019s coins as well,\u201d says Sofia Andersson.\n\nOnce the treasure has been cleaned and examined, it will be appraised. If the Swedish National Heritage Board decides to acquire it for the state, the finders will receive a substantial reward.\n", "link": "https://fof.se/artikel/silverskatten-kan-vara-epokgorande/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
