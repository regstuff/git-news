Then, for one of my elective courses, I chose a course that combines NLP with computer vision, studying the relationship between language and vision( A cutting-edge research topic at my university).\nNow I need to choose another course, but none of the options seem particularly appealing to me:\n\n1. Formal Semantics: Propositional Logic, First-Order Logic, Lambda Calculus. In the second part of the course, Syntax and Semantics, Montague Grammar. ( I know it\u2019s a bit outdated) \n\n\n2. Neurolinguistics ( neurobiological foundations of language ): I would choose this mostly for personal interest (I have a background in linguistics) and because the university where I\u2019m studying is among the best for this type of research. I thought it could potentially give me useful knowledge for research, perhaps understanding neurolinguistics well could help improve the language of AI systems (??).\n\n\n3. Language Modeling and Cognition: A theoretical course based on studying papers that analyze the capabilities of LLMs. So, you don\u2019t study how to create LLMs, but instead, you read papers on their reasoning abilities, cognitive capabilities, etc. Interesting, but it seems a bit useless.\n\n\n4. Computational Linguistics and Language-Based Interaction: \nAn NLP course for beginners, covering topics such as linguistic datasets, distributional semantics and vector spaces, neural networks, attention, transformers, machine translation, language models (large language models), and generative models.   \nI really liked the idea of this course, but since it is from a different department and is also designed for beginners (like my NLP course), these are topics that I will cover in other courses, both in NLP and in the two \nML exams I will take. the only new topics would be machine translation, LLM and maybe trasformers \n\n5. An other NLP or Machine-Human Dialogue course: These are offered by master\u2019s programs in computer science or engineering, so I\u2019m not sure if my math and programming skills are enough, and that scares me a bit.\n\n\nMy dilemma is that I want to create a study plan that focuses on research but is also technical enough to allow me to work in industry\nI already know that I really enjoy doing research; I would feel more valued compared to working in a company. Plus, I\u2019m not sure how well I\u2019d fit in a job that requires doing the same things over and over: data analysis, pipelines, implementing algorithms, etc. In fact, for those kinds of jobs, it would have been better to study engineering or computer science, but the nature of my course is different.\nBut academica sucks most of the time and In a company you get paid way better.
