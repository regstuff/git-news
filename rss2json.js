We worked with the [Cut Cross Entropy]( authors from Apple to make it work in Unsloth. CCE is like FA2, but for cross entropy. Via on the fly matrix mults, one does not have to materialize the logits at all, cutting VRAM usage by a lot.\n2. CCE also skips computation on small probabilities in the gradient, which boosts its performance whilst maintaining fantastic accuracy. CCE alone pushes 70B to do 1.85x longer context lengths, and 8B to do 3.6x longer lengths.\n3. By combining Unsloth's [gradient checkpointing]( algo which smartly offloads activations to system RAM, we can multiply the effects of CCE and GC. Unsloth's GC alone pushes 70B to do 7x longer lengths and 8B does 3.3x longer lengths. In total, 12 - 13x longer lengths are possible.\n4. 5.
