For instance, a Danish sentence may be broken into multiple lines, while the same content in Kalaallisut might be represented as a single sentence (or vice versa). This makes **direct sentence-to-sentence alignment** difficult, as these structural differences confuse aligners and lead to mismatches.\n2. **Handling Key Elements (Names, Dates, Punctuation)**: I attempted to focus on key elements like **dates, names, and punctuation marks** (e.g., \":\", \"?\") to improve the alignment. While this method helped in some instances, the overall improvement was minimal. In many cases, these elements are present in one language but missing in the other, causing further misalignment.\n3. **Failure of Popular Aligners**: I\u2019ve tried various well-known text aligners, including **Hunalign**, **Bertalign**, and models based on **sentence embeddings**. Unfortunately, none of these tools scaled well to the size of my text files or successfully addressed the linguistic nuances between Kalaallisut and Danish. These tools either struggled with the scale of the data or failed to handle the unique sentence structures of the two languages.\n4. **Custom Code Attempts**: I even developed my own custom alignment code, trying different approaches like **sliding windows**, **cosine similarity**, and **dynamic window resizing** based on similarity scores. However, I\u2019ve still been unable to achieve satisfactory results. The text formatting differences, such as **line breaks and paragraph structures**, continue to pose significant challenges.\n\n# What Can I Do?\n\nGiven that **structural differences** and **formatting nuances** between the two languages are making it hard to align these files automatically, I\u2019d really appreciate any suggestions or tools that could help me **successfully align Kalaallisut and Danish parallel files**. Is there a method or tool that can handle these nuances better, or would a more custom, linguistic-focused solution be required?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1g2xp71/challenges_in_aligning_kalaallisut_and_danish/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "King Charles 'won't stand in way' if Australia chooses to axe monarchy and become republic", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/king-charles-wont-stand-in-way-australia-republic/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "This bacteria can produce fibers eight times stronger than steel.
