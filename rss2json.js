At first, I was convinced this was a glitch\u2014until I started using it and realized how insanely convenient it is!\n\n\\### Why This Feature Rocks\n\nThe magic lies in how it carries over the key \u201ccontext\u201d from your old conversation into the new one, letting you pick up right where you left off. Normally, I try to keep each ChatGPT conversation focused on a single topic (think linear chaining). But let\u2019s be real\u2014sometimes mid-chat, I\u2019ll think of a random question, need to dig up some info, or want to branch off into a new topic. If I cram all that into one conversation, it turns into a chaotic mess, and ChatGPT\u2019s responses start losing their accuracy.\n\n\\### My Old Workaround vs. The Canvas\n\nBefore this, my solution was clunky: I\u2019d open a text editor, copy down the important bits from the chat, and paste them into a fresh conversation. Total hassle. Now, with the canvas feature, I can neatly organize the stuff I want to expand on and just kick off a new chat. No more context confusion, and I can keep different topics cleanly separated.\n\n\\### Why I Love the Canvas\n\nThe canvas is hands-down one of my favorite ChatGPT features. It\u2019s like a built-in, editable notepad where you can sort out your thoughts and tweak things directly. No more regenerating huge chunks of text just to fix a tiny detail. Plus, it saves you from endlessly scrolling through a giant conversation to find what you need.\n\n\\### How to Use It\n\nDidn\u2019t start with the canvas open? No problem! Just look below ChatGPT\u2019s response for a little pencil icon (labeled \u201cEdit in Canvas\u201d). Click it, and you\u2019re in canvas mode, ready to take advantage of all these awesome perks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ko45go/thought_it_was_a_chatgpt_bug_turns_out_its_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Homo erectus from the seabed\u2014new archaeological discoveries in Indonesia", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-05-homo-erectus-seabed-archaeological-discoveries.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
