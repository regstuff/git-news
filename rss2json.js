The KPP has no elected representative and very little public visibility.\n\nHowever, in his notification to the TK, Ziobro argued that the KPP \u201chas identical goals to other communist parties in the 20th century\u201d, including introducing a system \u201cmodelled on Soviet Russia\u201d with \u201ctotalitarian methods and practices\u201d.\n\nNawrocki likewise wrote that the KPP\u2019s aims and activities are \u201ccontrary to the legal order of Poland\u201d, and that \u201ccommunist ideology is directed against fundamental human values \u200b\u200band the traditions of European and Christian civilisation\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, after hearings to consider Ziobro and Nawrocki\u2019s applications, the TK found that \u201cthe goals and activities of the Communist Party of Poland are inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution\u201d, specifically articles 11 and 13, said Paw\u0142owicz.\n\nArticle 11 states that political parties must \u201cbe founded on the principle of\u2026 the equality of Polish citizens\u201d and shall seek to \u201cinfluence the formulation of the policy of the state by democratic means\u201d.\n\nArticle 13, meanwhile, stipulates that political parties \u201cwhose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods and the modes of activity of Nazism, fascism and communism\u2026\\[or\\] the application of violence for the purpose of obtaining power or to influence the state policy\u2026shall be prohibited\u201d.\n\nThe KPP\u2019s programme calls for \u201cpreparing working people for a joint and conscious struggle to eliminate exploitation by building a classless, democratic society within the framework of a socialist system\u201d.\n\nThe\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily notes that, in 2015, the KPP removed the call for communist revolution from its platform in order to avoid potential legal problems.\n\nHowever, in its ruling today, the TK said it had assessed not only the KPP\u2019s programme adopted in 2015 but also the statute it adopted on its founding in 2002, as well as various other publications, statements and actions.\n\nSpeaking before the TK, the chairwoman of the KPP\u2019s national executive committee, Beata Karo\u0144, argued that, while her party has \u201ca certain vision of what it wants\\[,\\]\u2026if what we propose is so unattractive, we simply won\u2019t gain support in elections\u201d, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nThe TK\u2019s decision should lead to the delegalisation of the KPP, as Poland\u2019s law on political parties states that, \u201cif the Constitutional Tribunal issues a ruling on the unconstitutionality of the goals or activities of a political party, a court shall immediately issue a decision to remove the political party from the register\u201d.\n\nPaw\u0142owicz said today that the tribunal would immediately forward its ruling to Warsaw\u2019s district court, which maintains the register of political parties in Poland.\n\nHowever, the TK itself is embroiled in a\u00a0[dispute over its own legality]( with the current government refusing to recognise its rulings due to the presence of\u00a0[judges illegitimately appointed](\u00a0under the former Law and Justice (PiS) administration.\n\nAnother of the TK\u2019s judges, former PiS MP\u00a0[Stanis\u0142aw Piotrowicz]( was himself a member of the Polish United Workers\u2019 Party who served as a state prosecutor when Poland was under communist rule, including during\u00a0[martial law](\u00a0in the 1980s.

However, that happens very rarely: the last time was in 2009 under then-President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski.\n\nIn this case, there appears a theoretical chance of success, given that over two thirds of MPs supported the dog-leashing ban. However, sources suggest that members of the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party who originally voted for the bill will now not be willing to give the government a victory against the PiS-aligned president.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Nawrocki\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that he was vetoing the bill banning the chaining of dogs. He argued that, \u201calthough the intention \u2013 protecting animals \u2013 is just and noble, the law itself was poorly drafted\u201d.\n\nIn particular, the president argued that elements of the legislation introducing minimum sizes for dog kennels \u2013 of at least 20m\u00b2 for the largest dogs \u2013 were unrealistic and would \u201charm farmers, breeders and ordinary rural households\u201d.\n\nHis decision to veto the law was condemned by figures from the ruling coalition, including the speaker of the Sejm, W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, who said that it made him \u201cfeel like crying\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, Czarzasty announced that he had launched efforts for the Sejm to overturn the veto. That requires the support of at least three fifths of MPs in a vote at which at least half of all MPs are present.\n\n\u201cThe \\[ruling\\] coalition has made a decision on this matter, and the veto will be voted on, because we consider this decision by the president to be yet another that is absolutely incomprehensible,\u201d said Czarzasty.\n\nGiven how the Sejm\u00a0[originally voted](\u00a0on the bill in September, it appears possible that Czarzasty has a chance of success. Among the 415 MPs present for the vote in the 460-seat chamber, 280 (67%) were in favour of the bill.\n\nThat included all MPs from the ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right, but also 49 MPs from the national-conservative PiS, including the party\u2019s leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski (who is a well-known proponent of animal rights). A further 84 PiS MPs voted against and 30 abstained.\n\nHowever, unnamed PiS politicians told Wirtualna Polska, a leading news website, that they do not want to help the ruling coalition achieve a victory against Nawrocki, who was elected as president this year with PiS\u2019s support and has regularly stymied the government\u2019s agenda through vetos and other actions.\n\nInstead, PiS is likely to argue that parliament should support an alternative bill on the treatment of dogs that Nawrocki said, when announcing his veto, he would soon submit for consideration.\n\nSo far, there are no details of what it will contain, but the president said that it \u201cwill allow dogs to be unleashed, will truly improve the lives of animals, but will not impose restrictive and unrealistic obligations on people to build kennels \\[of\\] several dozen square meters\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think \\[the attempt to overturn the veto\\] will succeed,\u201d PiS MP and former party spokesman Rados\u0142aw Fogiel told broadcaster RMF. \u201cThe president said he will propose his own bill, which no longer has these flaws and loopholes.\u201d\n\nThe overturning of presidential vetoes is extremely rare. In the years 2008 and 2009, the Sejm overturned a number of vetos issued by PiS-aligned president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski. However, since then, under Presidents Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski, Andrzej Duda and Nawrocki.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/03/polish-parliament-will-seek-rare-override-of-presidential-veto-on-dog-chaining-ban/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Colombian President Gustavo Petro requested international assistance after denouncing the alleged kidnapping of Colombian fighters in Ukraine", "summary": "The president requested official intervention with Zelensky's government following the case of a young compatriot who claims to be held against his will by Ukrainian military personnel.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro announced via his official Twitter account the alleged kidnapping of Colombian citizens in Ukraine.

According to his testimony, several salaries equivalent to 19 million Colombian pesos per month have not been paid. This adds an economic dimension to the case, in addition to the humanitarian one.\n\n# Presidential orders and official reaction\n\nIn response to the situation, Gustavo Petro instructed the Colombian Foreign Ministry to provide direct diplomatic support and representation. He requested that contact be established with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to facilitate the prompt release and repatriation of those affected.\n\nThe presidential pronouncement included another relevant provision: the dispatch of a medical mission from the Military Hospital of Colombia to Ukraine, with the aim of caring for children who are victims of the conflict.\n\nHe indicated that the care could also be extended to Ukrainian combatants who have lost limbs.\u00a0**\u201cI have decided that the Military Hospital will also go to Ukraine to treat children who have been wounded in that war and have lost limbs.**\u00a0The service can also be extended to Ukrainian combatants in the same condition,\u201d the head of state wrote in X.\n\n# Context and background of Colombians in Ukraine\n\nThe presence of Colombian citizens in the war in Ukraine has increased significantly since the beginning of the armed conflict with Russia. According to reports in\u00a0*El Pa\u00eds*\u00a0,\u00a0**the Ukrainian Foreign Legion has recruited volunteers of various nationalities under specific, short-term contracts.**\n\nSeveral non-governmental organizations documented complaints related to opaque contracts and difficulties in returning to their countries of origin once the employment relationship ended.\n\nInternational media outlets have reported that, in some cases, foreign volunteers face administrative barriers to leaving the country after fulfilling their commitments.
