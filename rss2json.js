While the titans China (39%) and the US (15%) might have a stranglehold in this space, India\u2019s recent growth spurt and accelerated rise in quality research has put us on the map (5%). I explore how India is the number 3 science &amp; technology power in [Post 01]( of this series, and explain how this recent growth spurt was due to a university and college rankings published by the government of India in [Post 02]( and not any increase in funding towards research.\n\nIn this post I try to understand how India currently funds research, and where India should look towards to increase its funding. Originally, this post was a part of [Post 02]( and I will have to repeat some of the figures and information in order to make a cohesive argument. This particular post leans more on opinion, which I try to ground with citations. But it is less diligent or polished, mainly because it touches on economics, something I am not versed in. Even so, the numbers make a pretty convincing story.\n\n[Post 00: About the Series](\n\n[Post 01: India\u2019s Standing](\n\n[Post 02: India\u2019s Growth Spurt](\n\n[ASPI\u2019s Interactive Tech-Tracker Website](\n\n**Data:** This series is based on data from Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), who have since 2023 maintained a database about scientific research in certain critical strategic technologies. They measure which country contributed how much to the top research in each technology \\[1,2\\]. Their work is free to view at the [website]( \\[3\\]. A large portion of this post also uses data from the report [R&amp;D Statistics at a Glance, 2022-23]( by the NSTMIS, which is a Government of India Department of Science &amp; Technology arm that tracks R&amp;D related statistics in India \\[14\\]. The India data is compared to data from several G20 countries, obtained from the OECD \\[43\\] and the United Nations \\[47, 48\\].\n\n**Disclaimer:** ASPI and NSTMIS are not responsible for this post or any analysis or opinions contained in it.\n\n**Details:** For references, methodology, list of all technologies, other posts in this series, and other meta discussion like volunteering, please refer to my [Post 00]( Remember to read ASPI\u2019s original reports at [1]( and [2]( , and visit their [website]( \\[3\\]. Do read the [R&amp;D Statistics at a Glance, 2022-23]( report by the NSTMIS, which will give a broader perspective for India.\n\n# Yearly R&amp;D Investment by Country, 2003 - 2023\n\n[Figure 3A: Yearly gross expenditure in research and development \\(GERD\\) by country, during 2003 - 2023, as a percentage share of \\(i\\) Global GDP that year \\(log scale\\) \\(ii\\) National GDP that year, for certain countries. These countries were selected because they were the only countries in the top 5 during this period for their share in critical technology research, averaged over 64 technologies, based on ASPI data. GDP &amp; GERD data are from UNESCO Institute for Statistics and UN Statistics Division.](\n\nThe figure above was discussed in some detail in my previous post (Figure 2D in [Post 02]( illustrating trends in Gross Expenditure in R&amp;D (GERD) over the years for different nations. GERD is represented as a fraction of global GDP in the top subfigure, to give a sense of the actual relative shares of different countries in the global R&amp;D funding. The second subfigure illustrates GERD trends as a percentage of national GDP, which I will call GERD%N in short.\n\nI bring up the figure again to emphasise that India\u2019s GERD%N is very low. Despite having a GDP in the top 5 since 2020, our share of global GERD has been low simply because we do not prioritise funding R&amp;D, as our terrible GERD%N illustrates. Not only is our GERD%N low, it is stagnant and in slow decline.\n\nTo understand where India is lacking in R&amp;D expenditure, and to understand where we need to first prioritise increasing R&amp;D, it is worth looking at how R&amp;D funding is distributed.\n\n# Yearly R&amp;D Expenditure in India, 2003 - 2023\n\nThis section is to present part of how the GoI views its R&amp;D strategy, as gleaned from their [Research and Development Statistics At A Glance]( \\[14\\]. While the numbers in the previous figures tell a dismal story, the government tries to make a mostly positive case for itself.\n\n[Figure 3B: \\(i\\) Top-Left: ASPI\u2019s net citation score for India in highly cited research, yearly.\u00a0\\(ii\\) Top-Right: India\u2019s percentage share in highly cited research, as per ASPI. Share in each technology calculated, and average of all 64 reported here. Data same as Figure 2B Top.\u00a0\\(iii\\) Bottom-Left: India\u2019s yearly gross expenditure in research and development \\(GERD\\), during 2003 - 2023. Data from National Science and Technology Management Information System \\(NSTMIS\\), Department of Science &amp; Technology \\(DST\\), Ministry of Science &amp; Technology, Government of India. Data from 2021-2022 financial year extrapolated using GDP growth rate obtained from MoSPI, GoI.\\(iv\\) Bottom-Right: Comparison between yearly growth rate of GERD versus GDP at current prices. Figure from NSTMIS, Department of Science &amp; Technology, Ministry of Science &amp; Technology, GoI.](\n\nThe figure shows how India\u2019s R&amp;D expenditure has definitely grown in rupees, but in a linear trend (straight line) whereas India\u2019s rise in citations in critical technologies has risen far more rapidly (dramatically rising curve). A reminder: these GERD figures include all types of R&amp;D expenditure in a country, whether it is from the private sector or from the government.\n\nA positive case for GoI would sound something like this: \u201cIndia has (largely) increased its funding in research at the same pace as the increase in India\u2019s GDP. In rupee amounts, the amount India spent on research in 2020 is 2.5 times what it used to spend in 2005.\u201c\n\nThe first problem with this is that these are at \u201ccurrent prices\u201d, so don\u2019t account for inflation. Accounting for inflation, India still shows a definite but moderate increase in its R&amp;D spend: in PPP terms, GERD rose to $57.9 billion in 2020-21, from $50.3 billion in 2014-15 \\[14\\].\n\nThe second problem is that this is a race among nations, and almost everyone has been trying to increase their GERD%N from an already higher value, while India is contentedly constant at a dismal 0.65% despite its appreciable GDP. If the goal is to grow GERD only and exactly at the GDP growth rate, then that is a non-competitive strategy.\n\nThere is another argument favouring complacency. Although India\u2019s GERD%N increased linearly, its research output increased exponentially. At this rate, we will remain competitive and gain ground in the race. So, if research outcomes can be improved without spending more money, that would be a great frugal way to make progress in the race. India is, after all, poor - as we are all reminded when we don\u2019t meet our own expectations. One might point out how in the US and Germany, consistent funding could not prevent China from eating away at their share of global critical technology research (see [Post 02]( So if some frugal innovation is more productive than loads of funding, why not just stick to frugality?\n\nIn [Post 02]( I had explained how this exponential growth in India\u2019s research output has come from pressuring our higher education institutes to perform in research through an \u201cofficial\u201d government ranking NIRF \\[36\\]. While this has forced the higher education sector to step up its game, this has happened alongside a quiet proliferation of academic malpractice, to the point that NIRF announced negative marks for universities with retracted papers \\[41, 42\\].\n\nThere is reason to believe that there has been an upsurge of genuine quality research during and due to NIRF. But how long will that sustain if scientific breakthroughs are equated with paper mill slop with inflated citation counts due to university-sanctioned malpractice? Whatever incentive remains for genuine research will be whittled out in a matter of time.\n\nThe only way to identify good research from bad is to identify research which drives innovation, whether in more research or in the economy. This is where typically market forces come in and reward the scientists with huge paydays. But I get ahead of myself.\n\nThe first thought in a typical Indian would be to blame the government for not funding R&amp;D enough. So I take a pause here on this storyline of declining funding, and take a look at how our government spends the R&amp;D money it has.\n\n# GoI R&amp;D Expenditure Breakdown\n\nGovernments in India (central &amp; state governments, and public sector industry) fund roughly 59.2% of India\u2019s R&amp;D. This will be discussed more later, but I want to discuss the Centre's, i.e., GoI\u2019s direct expenditure in its scientific agencies, amounting to 41% of our national expenditure in R&amp;D (my math might be a bit off). This is broken down in the figure below.\n\n[Figure 3C: Share of funding for the scientific agencies under the Government of India, in the financial year 2020-21. Data from NSTMIS, Department of Science &amp; Technology, Ministry of Science &amp; Technology, GoI. This represents roughly 41&amp;#37; of India\u2019s total GERD for the financial year 2020-21.](\n\nThe figure above illustrates which scientific agencies under the government get most of the funding from the Government of India. The largest chunk goes to agencies such as DRDO, DOS, and DAE which, as you might expect, are not the typical source for research funding from universities. The most important GoI scientific agencies that funnel money to R&amp;D to universities (no citations here) are the ICAR, DST, CSIR, &amp; DBT, at least for the critical technologies being discussed in this series. Note that agencies like ICAR, DBT, &amp; CSIR spend nearly all their budget on R&amp;D or supporting research institutes, and DST spends a large majority of its funds similarly \\[34, 35\\]. Some grants also come from the University Grants Commission (not in figure), but it is not clear how much.\n\nTo put it in perspective, ICAR, DBT, DST, &amp; CSIR, which are the source of funding for myriad institutes and universities across India, amount to about 13% of India\u2019s national GERD. In comparison, 25% of India\u2019s GERD goes to just three institutions - DRDO, DOS, &amp; DAE.\n\n**Three elephants get a gym subscription**\n\nWith over 60% of GoI\u2019s GERD going to only three institutions - DRDO, DOS, and DAE - I want to take a quick look at their research performance. The ASPI data does not have historical trajectory for their performance, and only has recent data, i.e., their share in the highly cited publications in the five year period 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe Homi Bhabha National Institute (under DAE) features in the top 10 globally for two nuclear technologies, and has a broad presence in several other technologies as well. In contrast, the performance of DRDO and DOS do not feature in the top 10 or even in top 50 in terms of quality scientific publications for any of the technologies in ASPI\u2019s dataset. They rank often in the top 100 and 200, but that doesn\u2019t behoove institutions who get such a high share of India\u2019s research funding. On the face of it, they seem to underperform. The detailed list of their rankings is included in [Post 00](\n\nWhenever any criticism of national and especially defense-related institutions is brought up, it is common for patriots to respond defensively. It is possible that ASPI missed some DRDO papers (for example, if DRDO was misspelt, and their program didn\u2019t handle that case), or did not include DRDO\u2019s subsidiaries like DFRL, DIBER, ANURAG, etc. in the dataset. Remember that this dataset was compiled by a few human beings in a think tank with limited resources, and they had to deal with over 2.2 million papers from \\~1.8 million authors, and not all authors update their ORC IDs. Of course there will be mistakes. The point is, this is the only dataset we have to make international technology-specific bibliometric comparisons.\n\n&lt; For those thinking this is a Western think tank trying to malign India, what can I even say? Australia unceremoniously suspended visits of Indian officials after our nuclear test, and now ASPI ranks HNBI twice in the top 10 for nuclear technologies. But for some reason, they will have an agenda only against DRDO or ISRO. Makes little sense. Have fun in your bubble. /&gt;\n\nRemember that someone\u2019s ability to make novel scientific breakthroughs has little bearing on their ability to execute great engineering. So even though DRDO and ISRO don\u2019t have a stellar performance in research output, that does not take away from their R&amp;D abilities. One example of this is how the M3 instrument on-board Chandrayaan-I made the first map of water presence on the moon \\[60\\]. But since the instrument was American and the data was analysed by an American team, only 2 of the 29 authors of this paper are from ISRO. As per ASPI\u2019s metrics, India will only get 7% of the credit for this paper. This incident spurred ISRO to reach out to Indian universities (who have a far smaller budget, as you can see by now) to ask for interesting experiments they could send to space. This is also how you can end up with some countries with absolutely no space capabilities publishing major scientific papers on space-related technologies, simply because they conducted the right experiment with the right instruments at the right time. And vice versa.\n\nHowever stellar their achievements, all the three institutes - DRDO, DOS (includes ISRO), and DAE (includes BARC) - could do better. While I might expand on this in sector-specific posts later in this series, some points that come to mind are: the glacial progress in thorium based nuclear reactors \\[66\\], SpaceX stealing a lap on ISRO with reusable rockets \\[65\\], and the many struggles India has faced in developing and producing advanced aircrafts \\[64\\].\u00a0\n\nThe DRDO, with 50 different laboratories, is especially bloated. Not all its labs focus on the weapons or related systems either. Some work on cryptography, bioenergy, food technology, metallurgy, etc. While having an expert within DRDO on every defense-relevant topic makes some sense, I am not sure if these labs (especially those peripherally related to defence) have been cultivating the best scientists through their culture of job-secure complacency.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed by GoI, who pushed to reform all three \\[61\\]. The reforms in the space sector are pretty public \\[62\\], those in the atomic energy sector not so much, but all in all they seem to tend towards opening up the institutions to allow more startups and private companies to work in these previously difficult-to-enter technological domains \\[62, 63\\]. I only submit that privatisation is not enough. Research metrics, too, should factor in these reforms.\n\nWhile the government of India\u2019s past prioritisation of few insular mammoth institutions (DRDO, DAE, DOS) has left less room for other scientific domains, one might expect the invisible hand of the free market to reward great innovations and innovators. Has it?\n\n# Private Sector R&amp;D Investment, 2003 - 2023\n\nIn the figure below, the national gross expenditure in R&amp;D (GERD) is broken down by the source of funding. Most of this expenditure has one of three sources: (i) government funding through scientific agencies and the like, (ii) public or private business sector, and (iii) funding from higher education universities &amp; colleges. Please note that the business sector includes public sector companies, and that the higher education sector can include funding sourced from either public or private sector. In India\u2019s case, the public sector businesses contribute 4.4% of national GERD, meaning that the private sector industry only contributes 36.4% \\[12\\].\n\n[Figure 3D: \\(i\\) Top: Share of business sector R&amp;D expenditure during 2003-2023 period, for the countries in Figure 2B. For Indian data, the numbers plotted for a given year \\(say 2020\\) are the numbers for the financial year beginning that year \\(2020-21\\). \\(ii\\) Bottom: Sectorwise share of national GERD for different G20 countries, as a percentage of total national GERD in 2020 \\(exceptions: Australia - 2019 data, Mexico - 2017 data\\). Data for both figures obtained primarily from OECD\u2019s Main Scientific and Technological Indicators dataset, and Indian data was from NSTMIS, DST, GoI.](\n\nIndia\u2019s GERD%N is low, not even breaching the 1% mark, as seen in an earlier figure (3A). By default most Indians would blame the government for this. The figure above shows that it is actually unusual for R&amp;D to so deeply rely on governments. It is usually the industry that drives research funding, not the governments, especially in developed economies. In some developing economies, like Mexico &amp; South Africa, the higher education sector takes the lead. Then there is communist China, where 77% of the GERD comes from businesses.\n\nExpecting the higher education sector to help India\u2019s GERD growth may not be very fruitful, considering their recent penchant for malpractice over honest scientific work \\[41, 42\\]. Further, they are only a small part of India\u2019s economy. Private sector industry, who would be the ultimate beneficiary of technological gains via improved productivity, should also have a high incentive to invest in R&amp;D in India, as is the case in most developed economies.\u00a0\n\nYet, India is the second worst among all G20 nations in terms of how small its business sector\u2019s contribution is towards GERD. The worst, Indonesia, has a private sector share of 7.3% \\[44\\]. Brazil roughly maintains a 1:1 ratio between public &amp; private \\[45\\]. Saudi Arabia recently reported a roughly equal government and business R&amp;D spending (\\~38% each), the education sector taking up 23% \\[46\\]. Turkiye in 2020 used to be like Canada &amp; Australia, with about 56% business : 39% education : 5% government split. But the business sector has recently taken over even more of the education sector\u2019s share in Turkiye \\[43\\].\n\nTo put things into perspective, it would require the Indian private sector industry to maintain its funding for research at the GDP growth rate, and then triple that final number, so its share could be 66% of India\u2019s GERD. For a more modest target of 53%, the private sector would have to double its GERD, i.e. an additional R&amp;D of 6.6 billion USD (for 2023, extrapolated using UN statistics \\[47\\] &amp; trends in GERD \\[14\\]). Even then, it brings our GERD%N to 0.9%, still short of 1%. Nonetheless, it\u2019d be a paradigm shift in India\u2019s technology landscape.\n\n# Research Development and Innovation Scheme\n\nThe RDI scheme was announced in July this year, and builds on the Anusandhan National Research Foundation, which is also a new institution to guide funding of research in India. The headline here is that the government has promised to allocate \u20b91 lakh crore over 6 years towards this scheme, and it has already allocated \u20b920,000 crores for 2025-26. To put this in perspective, India\u2019s entire GERD in 2020-21 was \u20b9127,000 crores. Even with GDP growth and an expected GERD growth, this single infusion of \u20b920,000 crores will amount to nearly 10% of India\u2019s GERD - an entirely new, additional source of R&amp;D expenditure. \\[22\\]\n\nAs per the government, the key objectives are (i) to encourage private sector involvement, (ii) to focus on critical technologies i.e., energy, climate, \u201cquantum\u201d, robotics, space, biotech, pharma, AI, \u201cdigital economy\u201d, (iii) self-reliance &amp; security, and (iv) flexibility. In that order.\n\nThe plan is to finance only half the cost of a project, to incentivise the private sector to fill in the other half. If successful, this alone might catapult our GERD%N to 0.75% from 0.65%. Financing is only through long-term low interest loans - no grants, no short-term loans. This incentivises deep research that can make money, i.e., practical private sector research that has a foreseeable economic impact. Finally, the money will be given out by a second level of managers, who are either research organisations (research parks, BIRAC, etc.) or financial institutions (investment funds / development finance institutions / NBFCs). \\[22\\]\n\nThe scheme is too new for me to do much more than stenography about it. Still, it is notable that the government identifies its top priority as incentivising business research expenditure. And if 0.05% of India\u2019s GDP can\u2019t sweeten the deal, what could? At the outset it is hard to imagine that this scheme will not be beset by corruption, which the government tries to avoid with expert fund managers. Still, how well-trained are the financial institutions in India for assessing long term, deep-tech research projects? Research organisations, like IIT research parks and BIRAC, have a much better understanding of what \u201cdeep tech\u201d means and how to assess their scientific credibility and business potential.\n\nAll in all, I credit GoI for correctly identifying that improving the private sector GERD is the biggest need of this hour. Too bad that this did not arise organically from within the industry.\n\n# Opinion\n\n**Indian Industry : A Short Story on Culture**\n\nThis is a story about N R Narayan Murthy, chairman emeritus of Infosys. In his speech at the 2015 IISc convocation, he began with a list of MIT\u2019s (USA) inventions in the last 50 years, including the GPS, bionics, cybernetics, microchips, e-mail, etc. In this context he gives an amazing quote, which I cannot do justice to unless I repeat it verbatim \\[51\\] -\n\n&gt;On the other hand, let us pause and ask what the contributions of Indian institutions of higher learning particularly IISc and IITs, have been over the last 60-plus years to make our society and the world a better place. Is there one invention from India that has become a household name in the globe? Is there one technology that has transformed the productivity of global corporations? Is there one idea that has led to an earth-shaking invention to delight global citizens? Folks, the reality is that there is no such contribution from India in the last 60 years. The only two ideas that have transformed the productivity of global corporations \u2013 The Global Delivery Model and The 24-hour workday \u2013 came from a company called Infosys.\n\nComparing \u201cglobal delivery model\u201d &amp; \u201cthe 24-hour workday\u201d to GPS &amp; e-mail is pure hubris. While I actually don\u2019t disagree with Mr. Murthy on India\u2019s lacklustre R&amp;D, it is worth looking at his glasshouse. In 2015 under CEO Vishal Sikka, Infosys pledged a $1 billion charitable investment into the then-non-profit OpenAI \\[53\\]. This &amp; other such \u201cexcesses\u201d may have put Sikka in crosshairs with Mr. Murthy\u2019s conservatism, and Sikka was ousted \\[52\\]. While I can\u2019t guess at boardroom politics or how much Sikka\u2019s AI push mattered in his exit, Sikka made it a point to mention OpenAI in the first paragraph of his exit letter \\[54\\]. So, after Mr. Murthy concluded lambasting IISc scientists in 2015 for not doing enough R&amp;D, he went back to work so he could elbow out his pro-R&amp;D CEO over the next two years. The irony is delicious.\n\nIf this is the culture at top \u201ctech\u201d companies in India, what culture pervades the generational conglomerates with real money? What imprint does it leave on our investment ecosystem? What startups would such a culture prefer funding?\n\n**Innovation vs Competition**\n\n[This video]( and [this post]( give important context \\[71, 72\\]. It may be that the Indian industry is steeped in complacency in most sectors. The big players in India could, if they wanted to, unilaterally change the pace of Indian innovation. But they don\u2019t need to, because there is no competition. [An article]( by two 2025 Nobel Prize in Economics winners \\[73\\] shows an inverted U relationship between competition and innovation. High competition creates lobsters in a pot climbing over others to get to the top (not good for innovation). Too little competition and you have complacency, probably like in India. A recipe for corporate death.\u00a0\n\n**Startup Ecosystem : Pai v Goyal, Round 1**\n\nPiyush Goyal, Minister for Commerce &amp; Industry, in a speech at the Startup Mahakumbh in 2025 made pointed remarks about how vegan ice-cream &amp; hyper-fast logistics startups don\u2019t cut it anymore. He talks about deep-tech startups, i.e., those that do R&amp;D in state-of-the-art scientific technologies. Our deep-tech startup statistics are a disturbing sign, he says, and appeals to investors to change their attitude and think beyond short-term wealth creation, calling out Shark Tank\u2019s Aman Gupta in the front row by name. Despite criticism, he doubled down on his remarks \\[55, 56\\]. I quote his most biting remarks that got him into trouble, but I suggest you [watch it in full]( (link starts at the remarks, goes on for about 10 minutes). Translations (by me) from Hindi are in curly brackets {}.\n\n&gt;We are focused on food delivery apps, turning unemployed youths into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house\u2026 \\[A\\]re we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls?... I know at least 3 or 4 billionaires whose children make one brand or the other very fancy ice cream and cookies and run a very successful business, and I have no complaints against that. But is that the destiny of India? {Is India\u2019s future satisfied with this?}... {What does India want to do? Make ice creams or \\[semiconductor\\] chips?}... {Is shopkeeping all we want to do?}... We may do all sorts of international trade agreements\u2026 With every one of them we talk about a startup bridge. But I can\u2019t take to them grocery stores and say this is India\u2019s offering for startups.\n\nT V Mohandas Pai spearheaded criticism of Goyal\u2019s remarks \\[57, 58\\], pointing out regulatory hurdles in getting foreign capital and letting insurance &amp; pension funds invest. But how do the grocery startups manage to get funded? Why do they not rely on FDI or pension funds?\u00a0\n\nThe top funded startup sector in 2024 in India was fintech with $2.5 billion (\\~23%). Deep-tech ranked 9th out of 10, raising $0.5 billion (\\~5%) \\[68\\]. While Mr. Pai raises valid points about the regulatory hurdles in getting funding, even if these hurdles were eased there is no reason to believe that the funds will go towards deep tech. Indian venture capital has demonstrated through their funding habits that they would rather fund lending apps \\[69\\] with potential for preying on the financially insecure, than invest in novel R&amp;D.\u00a0\n\nSome of Mr. Pai\u2019s other suggestions are now actually implemented - abolish the angel tax (done, \\[59\\]), and that the government should spend \u20b910,000 crore per year (the RDI scheme promises \u20b920,000 crore per year, \\[29\\]). The ball is now in the private sector\u2019s court. Yet, if Figure 3D and 2024\u2019s startup funding \\[68\\] is any trend, the private sector will fumble this too.\n\n**She, the State: more Swaha than Shree**\n\nI wonder if one of the reasons that India excelled in information technology was simply because a computer does not take up much space, and that services and products can be offered without any physical presence. Sure, the Enforcement Directorate (swaha\u2026) comes for all, so you would always need a handy army of accountants (swaha\u2026). But at least your products aren\u2019t being illegally impounded by the GST officer (swaha\u2026). You don\u2019t need to import scientific equipment (swaha\u2026) or pay rent for land use and compliance (swaha\u2026). Or at least, not as much.\n\nIf a scientist does get lucky with a breakthrough, they need lawyers (swaha\u2026) to file patents in India and abroad (swaha\u2026). Which may not even be the right thing to do. Once the patent is public, anybody can steal it. Who would dare a legal fight (swaha\u2026) in India for anything, let alone to protect their intellectual property? Worse, if they had the bad luck to innovate in a domain where the dominant buyer is the government (eg: transit, defense, space, etc.), you either give up on making a change or pay your way into paving a way (swaha\u2026).\n\nSo even if GoI\u2019s RDI scheme seeds a thousand startups, unless the government improves its MSME policies to make it easier to function as an everyday business, we won\u2019t see the bountiful harvest we are all hoping for.\n\n**Indian Industry : No excuses**\n\nThere is no excuse for the Indian private industry to not fund research and set up labs within their own companies. The [leading institution in NLP]( (eg: ChatGPT &amp; LLMs &amp; \u201cAI\u201d) is Google, with Meta &amp; Microsoft in the top 10, as are a few universities \\[3\\]. If the Indian industry claims that talent is lacking, the ethnonational makeup of US R&amp;D labs should disabuse them of that. Probably the most foundational paper for NLP in today\u2019s AI revolution is Google\u2019s 2017 \u201c[Attention is all you need]( \\[50\\], and one of its lead authors graduated from BIT Mesra. A later post will delve into the talent question, but it is plain to see that India does not lack talent.\n\nIndia\u2019s industrial disinterest in research can\u2019t be excused away by blaming other parties. The higher education institutions picked up under pressure with a good measure of both fraud and pure excellence. The government might be spending far too little on R&amp;D compared to other countries, but I don\u2019t want to hear that from our private industry whose contributions are abnormally low. I can understand the complaint about over-regulation breaking the backs of small businesses, but I don\u2019t want to hear about it from our megaconglomerates who can bend laws with lobbying and cronyism. The problem is simply this - Indian industry doesn\u2019t spend enough on R&amp;D, and Figure 3D makes it inarguably the single worst offender.\n\nIt is a common tendency for the citizens and the media to blame the government alone. The arguments even sound plausible. The Chinese government spends this large chunk on AI, why doesn\u2019t the Indian government? Caste based quotas are ruining universities! Look at all the hurdles set up by financial regulators, how do you expect anyone to fund research? It is time we start to ask questions of our industry as well \u2013\n\nWhat stopped Infosys, Wipro, &amp; TCS from investing in AI the way Microsoft, Google, &amp; Meta did? What quotas stop the industry from setting up research labs with well paid staff? What stops the same VCs who funded online gambling &amp; payday lenders from funding deep tech?\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe current government\u2019s political will to drag India kicking and screaming into an era of development rooted in science &amp; technology is truly unmatched, even if our labyrinthine legal system is a pain. Nevertheless, GoI is spurring on our universities, and reforming the big 3 (somewhat underperforming) agencies. RDI is a signal to the private sector to spend more on R&amp;D \u2013 an actual gamechanger, if only we can find willing private sector partners.\n\nWhatever noises the private sector may make, the numbers make it evident that neither the established industries nor the venture capital ecosystem have yet developed the necessary inclination for spending enough on R&amp;D, unlike most G20 countries where the business sector has the lion\u2019s share in GERD. The business sector in communist China all the way back in 2004 used to constitute over two thirds of the national GERD. It does not behoove the titans of Indian industry to complain, not when the statistics show how they shirk from their share of responsibility. \n\nHoping RDI kicks off with a bash this year, and we get a GERD bump from 0.65% to 0.75% of our GDP. We will know by this time next year. It is a long road to 1%.\n\nPS: My deepest condolences to Indonesia. May your industry spend more on R&amp;D too, if only to make it easier to shame the Indian industry into spending more.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ofyyok/crittech_03_indias_rd_spend_tldr_industrial/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Synthetic data generation for natural language", "summary": "I'm curious about some insights on creating sizeable datasets of synthetic content.

With U.S.\u2013Pakistan cooperation resuming, South Asia\u2019s strategic map is evolving, particularly as India continues to expand military modernization efforts following recent Indo-Pakistani hostilities.[geopoliticalmonitor](\n\n---\n\nAmericas\n--------\n\nThe United States remains firmly at the center of global geopolitical maneuvering under President Trump. His administration\u2019s restrained approach toward European conflicts and focus on bilateral deals\u2014such as those with Vietnam\u2014reflect a shift toward transactional diplomacy. Latin America, meanwhile, remains relatively quiet on the geopolitical front but faces indirect effects from shifting energy and trade dynamics driven by U.S. policy.[wtop+2](\n\n---\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nThis week\u2019s geopolitical landscape highlights a world balancing on fragmentation and recalibration. In Europe and Asia, power blocs are repositioning amid U.S. retrenchment, while the Middle East and Africa continue to grapple with instability and regional conflicts. The growing assertiveness of regional powers like Iran, Russia, and China against a pragmatically transactional U.S. foreign policy has intensified the sense of a multipolar global order in flux.[carnegieendowment+5](\n\n---\n\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts, questions, or any other relevant discussions on this topic.\n\n---\n\nI hope you have a great week!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ogaj56/weekly_discussion_thread_26_october_2025/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "1,400-year-old hieroglyphs reveal name of powerful Maya queen", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/1-400-year-old-hieroglyphs-reveal-name-of-powerful-maya-queen", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US official: If Netanyahu \u2018f**ks up the deal, Donald Trump will f**k him\u2019 \u2014 report", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/us-official-if-netanyahu-fks-up-the-deal-donald-trump-will-f-k-him-report/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "H-E-B donates $1 million to save Meals on Wheels across Texas, $5 million for food banks", "summary": "", "link": "https://news4sanantonio.com/news/instagram/h-e-b-donates-1-million-to-save-meals-on-wheels-across-texas-5-million-for-food-banks", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - LearningCircuit/Friendly-AI-Reviewer", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/LearningCircuit/Friendly-AI-Reviewer", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New radiocarbon dating of Egyptian artifacts puts Thera (Santorini) volcanic eruption prior to Pharaoh Ahmose", "summary": "", "link": "https://popular-archaeology.com/article/new-radiocarbon-dating-of-egyptian-artifacts-puts-thera-santorini-volcanic-eruption-prior-to-pharaoh-ahmose/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Stone tools trace Paleolithic Pacific migration into North America", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-10-stone-tools-paleolithic-pacific-migration.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Virginia Giuffre Has Spent Half Her Life Fighting For Justice In The Jeffrey Epstein Case, And She\u2019s Still Not Done", "summary": "", "link": "https://newzsquare.com/virginia-giuffre-has-spent-half-her-life-fighting-for-justice-in-the-jeffrey-epstein-case-and-shes-still-not-done/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open WebUI (K8s + Entra ID) \u2013 force logout?", "summary": "We run Open WebUI in K8s with Entra ID auth.  \nNeed to force all users to re-login so updated group memberships take effect.\n\nTried:\n\n* Deleted the K8s deployment completely and redeployed \u2013 users still stayed logged in\n* Entra ID policy requiring fresh token \u2013 Open WebUI ignores it\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Does Open WebUI check if OAuth token is valid?\n* How to force logout/re-auth for all users?\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1og4xg5/open_webui_k8s_entra_id_force_logout/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "FloatView - A video browser that finds and fills unused screen space automatically", "summary": "Hi!

Benozzi\u2019s study suggests that eye drops (containing pilocarpine and diclofenac) may improve near vision, but the study design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. More studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.\n", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205832.htm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can Japan's new leader afford to go hard on immigration?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/can-japan-new-leader-afford-to-go-hard-immigration-10931515", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018We\u2019ll march as many times as necessary\u2019: Peru\u2019s youth protesters defy state of emergency", "summary": "##Rapper shot dead by police becomes symbol of resistance in Peru, amid wave of gen Z rallies sweeping the world\n\nA youth group in Peru calling itself the Generation Z Collective says it will march again on Saturday in defiance of a [state of emergency declared by the government]( this week in the capital, Lima, and neighbouring port of Callao.\n\nGroup leaders said they would be honouring Eduardo Ruiz, a rapper known as Truko, who was shot dead by a plainclothed police officer last week during a huge anti-government march in Lima.\n\nThey also demanded the resignation of the new interim president, Jos\u00e9 Jer\u00ed, and the shutting down of Peru\u2019s unpopular congress, which they blame for a series of laws that they claim are contributing to soaring crime.\n\n\u201cWe have the constitutional right to protest,\u201d Jorge Calmet, one of the Generation Z leaders, told journalists on Thursday. \u201cThat right cannot be taken away from us by a police commander, a congressman \u2013 and certainly not by someone who pretends to be president.
