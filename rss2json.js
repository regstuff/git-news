Means are different, but ultimate answers are similar.\n\nScience uses physical means to find answers through experiments. Spirituality goes beyond physical, beyond senses, to experience energy dimensions that cannot be grasped through senses.

Many times they talked right in front of my room door's, were preparing breakfast for themselves so they were making noises, smashing doors etc. etc. Many times I got fed up, but I held it or I normally told them after sadhana. But this time I have had enough, I have had really stressful days at work also. So when I was doing Shambhavi, all I heard were them talking and making noises, I never did this before, but I just couldn't stand it so I shouted loudly SILENCE! But that was during Shambhavi. I resolved it with my family, but my question is if those things can do something bad in my system, that during Shambhavi I shouted like this. Ofcourse I felt off etc. But if it could do something worse, if you have for example heard Isha yoga teacher talk about this or something.
