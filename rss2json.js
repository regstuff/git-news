It does a number of different language pairs, but someone posted on r/AncientGreek about the English/ancient Greek pair. That thread got deleted by the moderators because discussion of AI violates that group's rules. I thought I would post a few notes here from testing it. I'm curious whether anyone knows anything more about who made this system, or whether there are any published descriptions of it by its authors.\n\nIn general, it seems like a big improvement over previous systems for this language pair.\n\nIt translates \"\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bc\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b1 \u1f10\u03c3\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\" as \"the leaves eat apples.\" It should be \"Sheep eat leaves.\" I've been using this sentence as a test of various systems for this language because it doesn't contain any cues from word order or inflections as to which noun is the subject and which is the object. (The word \u03bc\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b1 can also mean either apples or sheep.) This test seems to show that the system doesn't embody and statistical data on what nouns are capable of serving as the subjects of what verbs: sheep eat things, leaves don't.\n\nI tried this passage fro Xenophon's Anabasis (5.8), which I'd had trouble understanding myself, in part because of cultural issues:\n    \n\u1f45\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f14\u03c6\u03b7, \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c2. \u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f94\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03af \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03af \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f10\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd; \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1fbd \u1f00\u03c0\u1fc4\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd; \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2; \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1fc4\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1;\n\nIts translation:\n\nNevertheless, tell me, he said, what caused you to be struck? Was I asking you for something and when you wouldn't give it to me, I hit you? Or was I demanding payment? Or was I fighting about a love affair? Or was I drunk and acting violently?\n\nHere the literal meaning is more like \"Or were we fighting over a boy?\" So it looks like the system has been trained on victorian translations that use euphemisms for pederasty.\n\nWhen translating english to greek, it always slavishly follows the broad-strokes ordering of the english speech parts. It never puts the object first or the verb last, even in cases where that would be more idiomatic in Greek.\n\nSo in summary, this seems like a considerable step forward in machine translation of this language pair, but it still has some basic shortcomings that can be traced back to the challenges of dealing with a language that is highly inflected and has free word order.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1gr4ngl/testing_polytranslatorcom_on_englishancient_greek/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South African government says it won't help thousands of illegal miners inside a closed mine", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-illegal-miners-arrests-4d376ae6f6afca6170220f88fe859f90", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Musoq 0.17.2: SQL-like querying for Git repositories, C# code analysis, and more", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Puchaczov/Musoq", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI answer engine Perplexity is launching an advertising program in the US that displays sponsored follow-up questions alongside AI-generated answers to user queries.", "summary": "", "link": "https://the-decoder.com/perplexity-ai-launches-ad-program-with-sponsored-follow-up-questions/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - google/go-safeweb: Secure-by-default HTTP servers in Go.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/google/go-safeweb", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Building a Chatbot from Scratch Without Using APIs \u2013 Need Guidance!", "summary": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm passionate about AI and want to take on the challenge of building a chatbot from scratch, but without using any APIs.
