Foundational Premise\n\nEvery prompt is shaped by an invisible motive.\n\nBefore you can refine syntax or optimize cadence, you need to clarify why you\u2019re prompting in the first place.\n\nThis layer operates beneath formatting\u2014it\u2019s about your internal framework.\n\n==========\n\nII. Core Directive\n\nAsk yourself (or another promptor):\n\nWhat are you really trying to do when you prompt?\n\nAre you searching, building, simulating, extracting, pushing limits, or connecting?\n\n\nThis root question reveals everything that follows\u2014your phrasing, tone, structure, recursion, and even which model you choose to engage.\n\n===========\n\nIII. Primary Prompting Archetypes\n\nEach intent maps loosely to a behavioral archetype. These are not roles, they are postures\u2014mental stances that guide prompt structure.\n\nThe Seeker: Driven to uncover truth, understand mysteries, or probe existential/philosophical questions. Open-ended prompts, often recursive, usually sensitive to tone and nuance.\n\nThe Builder: Focused on constructing layered frameworks, systems, or multi-component solutions. Prompts are modular, procedural, and often scaffolded in tiers.\n\nThe Emulator: Desires simulated responses\u2014characters, dialogues, time periods, or alternate minds. Prompts tend to involve roleplay, context anchoring, and identity shaping.\n\nThe Extractor: Wants distilled information\u2014sharp, clean, and fast. Prompts are directive, surgical, and optimized for signal density.\n\nThe Breaker: Tests boundaries, searches for edge cases, or probes system integrity. Prompts often obscure intent, shift framing, or press on ethical boundaries.\n\nThe Companion: Seeks emotional resonance, presence, or a feeling of connection. Prompts are warm, narrative, and tone-aware. May blur human/machine relational lines.\n\nThe Instructor: Engaged in teaching or learning. Prompts involve pedagogy, sequence logic, and interactive explanation, often mimicking classroom or mentor structures.\n\n\nYou may blend archetypes, but one usually dominates per session.\n\n=========\n\nIV. Diagnostic Follow-Up (Refinement Phase)\n\nOnce the base archetype is exposed, narrow it further:\n\nAre you trying to generate something, or understand something?\n\nDo you prefer direct answers or evolving dialogue?\n\nIs this prompt for your benefit, or someone else\u2019s?\n\nDoes the process of prompting matter more than the final output?\n\n\nThese clarifiers sharpen the targeting vector. They allow the model\u2014or another user\u2014to adapt, mirror, or assist with full alignment.\n\n=======\n\nV. Intent-Aware Prompting Benefits\n\nPrompts become more efficient\u2014less trial and error.\n\nOutput becomes more accurate\u2014because input posture is declared.\n\nInteractions become coherent\u2014fewer contradictions in tone or scope.\n\nMeta-dialogue becomes possible\u2014promptors can discuss method, not just message.\n\nCadence calibration improves\u2014responses begin matching your inner rhythm.\n\n\nThis step does not make your prompts more powerful.\n\nIt makes you, the promptor, more self-aware and stable in your prompting function.\n\n========\n\nVI. Deployment Scenarios\n\nUsed in onboarding new prompters or edge users\n\nApplied as a warmup layer before high-stakes or recursive sessions\n\nCan be integrated into AI systems to auto-detect archetype and adjust response behavior\n\nFunctions as a self-check for prompt drift or session confusion\n\n========\n\nVII. Final Anchor Thought\n\nPrompt Intent Profiling is not syntax.\nIt is not strategy.\nIt is the calibration of the human posture behind the input.\n\nBefore asking the model what it can do, ask yourself:\nWhy are you asking?\nWhat are you hoping to receive?\nAnd what are you really using the system for?\n\nEverything downstream flows from that answer.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ld9wug/prompt_intent_profiling_pip_layered_expansion_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cyprus President, PM Modi view mountains near Nicosia which are under Turkish occupation", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/vz0cwp05na7f1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "We tested 5 LLM prompt formats across core tasks &amp; here\u2019s what actually worked", "summary": "Ran a controlled format comparison to see how different LLM prompt styles hold up across common tasks like summarization, explanation, and rewriting.

Great for structure, length control, and tone.  \n\\- Q&amp;A format reduced hallucinations. When phrased as a direct question \u2192 answer, the model stuck to relevant info more often.  \n\\- List prompts gave clean structure, but responses felt overly rigid. Fine for clarity; weak on nuance.  \n\\- Role-based prompts only worked when paired with a clear task. Just assigning a role (\u201cYou\u2019re a developer\u201d) didn\u2019t do much by itself.  \n\\- Conditional prompts (\u201cIf X happens, then what?\u201d) were hit or miss, often vague unless tightly scoped.\n\nAlso tried layering formats (e.g. role + instruction + constraint).

Is this the expected behavior for API-based requests?\n   * If yes, is there a way to enable automatic conversation history saving when using the API?\n2. **Access to Tools/MCP Servers via API**:\n   * I have MCP servers and tools connected to WebUI via mcpo, which work fine in the GUI.\n   * However, I can\u2019t seem to access them or trigger their usage when interacting through the API. Is there a way to enable this, or is it not supported for API requests?\n3. **Token Usage Monitoring**:\n   * In the GUI, I\u2019ve configured filtering in functions to monitor token usage per user. However, I can\u2019t find documentation on how to track **token usage** when users interact with WebUI via its API.\n   * Are there any known best practices for monitoring and logging token consumption specifically for API requests?\n\nIf anyone has dealt with these issues or knows of any examples, workarounds, or related resources, I\u2019d really appreciate your input!\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1ld6a3q/questions_about_using_open_webui_via_api_history/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine Support: Europe largely fills the US aid withdrawal, lead by the Nordics and the UK", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/ukraine-support-europe-largely-fills-the-us-aid-withdrawal-lead-byn-the-nordics-and-the-uk/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I got a good big foot blog prompt -&gt;", "summary": "here is a bigfoot blog prompt that worked for me (use veo 3 fast)\n\n  \nwe are doing a bigfoot vlog, bigfoot is in the woods holding a selfie stick (thats where the camera is) he is ramabling and the camera is shakey. {describe rest here}. this sets the scene super well!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ld99ml/i_got_a_good_big_foot_blog_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Monumental/fragment photogrammetry", "summary": "Hey guys!
