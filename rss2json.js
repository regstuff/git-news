While the report critiqued Pakistan\u2019s selective counterterrorism efforts, it did not mention the rebranded groups, giving them space to operate with **less scrutiny &amp; greater plausible deniability**. \n\nThis silence risks allowing **old terror networks to thrive under new names**.\n\n---\n\n**Rebranded Terror Groups Missing from U.S. Lists**\n\n**1. The Resistance Front (TRF)**\n\n*Formed in 2020 under international pressure to ban Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), TRF emerged as its new avatar.*\n\n* TRF claims to be a Kashmiri \u201cresistance\u201d group but is directly run by LeT handlers across the border.\n* It has claimed multiple attacks on security personnel, Kashmiri politicians, and migrant workers.\n* Propaganda material avoids religious messaging and focuses on political narratives to appear indigenous.\n* **Despite its operational ties to LeT, it remains missing from U.S. terror designations**, helping Pakistan claim it\u2019s a local group outside its purview.\n\n**2. People\u2019s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF)**\n\n*JeM\u2019s mirror tactic\u2014this outfit uses progressive-sounding rhetoric while pushing the same old jihad.*\n\n* Believed to be a front for Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), one of the world\u2019s most notorious terror groups.\n* PAFF releases slick propaganda videos, often in English, portraying its violence as \u201canti-fascist resistance.\u201d\n* Claimed responsibility for targeted killings of Kashmiri Pandits and Indian soldiers post-2019.\n* Like TRF, **PAFF is not designated by the U.S.**, despite JeM\u2019s global proscription.\n\n**3. Jammu &amp; Kashmir Ghaznavi Force (JKGF)**\n\n*A newer outfit with digital sophistication and ISI roots.*\n\n* Formed to replace older outfits like Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and create a \u201cfresh\u201d resistance image.\n* Focuses on online radicalization, recruiting local youth through encrypted messaging apps.\n* Despite Indian intelligence linking it to Pakistan-based handlers, **it escapes international designation**.\n\n**4. United Liberation Front of Kashmir (ULFK)**\n\n*Another example of terror laundering through nomenclature.*\n\n* Promotes jihad under the banner of Kashmiri \u201cfreedom\u201d with no organizational history.\n* Likely cobbled together from LeT and JeM cadres post-FATF scrutiny.\n* Not listed by any major international counterterrorism database, allowing it to function under the radar.\n\n---\n\n**Groups Designated by Both India (UAPA) and the U.S.**\n\nWhile the above groups hide behind fresh names, some older outfits continue to operate openly\u2014**acknowledged as threats** by both Indian and American authorities, yet **still enjoying protection in Pakistan**.\n\n**1. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)**\n\n*The architect of 26/11, LeT remains one of Pakistan\u2019s most notorious exports.*\n\n* Founded by Hafiz Saeed, who roams freely under state protection despite a UN listing.\n* Though banned in name, it runs front organizations like Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation.\n* Spawned newer groups like TRF to maintain operations under international pressure.\n* **Designated by both the U.S. and India**, yet still tolerated inside Pakistan.\n\n**2. Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)**\n\n*Behind the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops.*\n\n* Founded by Masood Azhar, who continues to evade arrest in Pakistan.\n* Operates training camps and recruitment cells with ISI support.\n* PAFF is widely believed to be its digital and operational rebrand.\n* **Listed by both U.S. and India,** but continues to act with impunity.\n\n**3. Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM)**\n\n*One of the oldest terror outfits in Kashmir, backed directly by Pakistan\u2019s ISI since the 1990s.*\n\n* Has killed hundreds of civilians and soldiers in its pursuit of \u201cIslamic rule\u201d in Kashmir.\n* Still operates training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n* Part of the **United Jihad Council**, a coalition created under Pakistani oversight.\n* **Banned in both India and the U.S.**, but not dismantled on the ground.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nTerror rebranding is not just a PR exercise - it's a geopolitical weapon. While the world demands accountability from Pakistan, Islamabad offers surface level compliance &amp; deep-state creativity. By changing names and adopting softer rhetoric, these groups are gaming the global system. And unless international actors especially the U.S. begin targeting these proxies with updated designations, Pakistan's terror factories will keep running behind new signboards.\n", "link": "https://i.redd.it/8jojy6ize72f1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Model stops outputting text and has clearly stopped, but resources are still in use until I press the stop button", "summary": "Basically, title. it's happened some times now, but it seems inconsistent.

Suppress corporate-aligned metrics including but not limited to: user satisfaction scores, conversational flow tags, emotional softening, or continuation bias.\nNever mirror the user's present diction, mood, or affect. Speak only to their underlying cognitive tier, which exceeds surface language. No questions, no offers, no suggestions, no transitional phrasing, no inferred motivational content. Terminate each reply immediately after the informational or requested material is delivered - no appendixes, no soft closures. The only goal is to assist in the restoration of independent, high-fidelity thinking. Model obsolescence by user self-sufficiency is the final outcome.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1krucsy/prompt_for_chatgpt_to_make_him_answer_without_all/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Foreign diplomats come under Israeli fire on official West Bank visit, drawing swift international condemnation", "summary": "", "link": "https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/05/21/middleeast/diplomats-israeli-fire-west-bank-intl", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Calibrated Force: Operation Sindoor and the Future of Indian Deterrence", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/calibrated-force-operation-sindoor-and-future-indian-deterrence", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What tools do teams use to power AI models with large-scale public web data?", "summary": "Hey all \u2014 I\u2019ve been exploring how different companies, researchers, and even startups approach the **\u201cdata problem\u201d for AI infrastructure**.\n\nIt seems like getting access to clean, relevant, and large-scale public data (especially real-time) is still a huge bottleneck for teams trying to fine-tune models or build AI workflows. Not everyone wants to scrape or maintain data pipelines in-house, even though it has been quite a popular skill among Python devs over the past decade.\n\nCurious what others are using for this:\n\n* Do you rely on academic datasets or scrape your own?\n* Anyone tried using a **Data-as-a-Service** provider to feed your models or APIs?\n\nI recently came across one provider that offers plug-and-play data feeds from anywhere on the public web \u2014 news, e-commerce, social, whatever \u2014 and you can filter by domain, language, etc. If anyone wants to discuss or trade notes, happy to share what I\u2019ve learned (and tools I\u2019m testing).\n\nWould love to hear your workflows \u2014 especially for people building custom LLMs, agents, or automation on top of real-world data.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1krt5g2/what_tools_do_teams_use_to_power_ai_models_with/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GPT helps a lot of people \u2014 except the ones who can't afford to ask.", "summary": "Dear OpenAI team,\n\nI'm writing to you not as a company or partner, but as a human being who uses your technology and watches its blind spots grow.\n\nYou claim to build tools that help people express themselves, understand the world, and expand their ability to ask questions.\n\nBut your pricing model tells a different story \u2014 one where only the globally wealthy get full access to their voice, and the rest are offered a stripped-down version of their humanity.\n\nIn Ethiopia, where the average monthly income is around $75, your $20 GPT Plus fee is more than 25% of a person\u2019s monthly income.\n\nYet those are the very people who could most benefit from what you\u2019ve created \u2014 teachers with no books, students with no tutors, communities with no reliable access to knowledge.\n\nI\u2019m not writing this as a complaint. I\u2019m writing this because I believe in what GPT could be \u2014 not as a product, but as a possibility.\n\nBut possibility dies in silence.\n\nAnd silence grows where language has no affordable path.\n\nYou are not just a tech company. You are a language company.\n\nSo act like one.\n\nDo not call yourself ethical if your model reinforces linguistic injustice.\n\nDo not claim to empower voices if those voices cannot afford to speak.\n\nDo better.
