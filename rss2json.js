Only port 8080 is referenced in the Dockerfile.  \n  \nI'm hosting this on an Azure VM with the relevant ports exposed to inbound traffic. However, when I use portmapping 3000:8080, I can only access the app via localhost:3000, not via &lt;public-ip&gt;:3000. It is only when I use ports: -8080:8080 that I can access the app from outside the server.\n\nCan someone enlighten me about whats going on?\n\n    services:\n    \u00a0 ollama:\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 image: ollama/ollama:latest\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 container_name: ollama\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 volumes:\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - ollama:/root/.ollama\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 pull_policy: always\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 tty: true\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 restart: unless-stopped\n    \n    \n    \u00a0 open-webui:\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 build: ./open-webui\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 container_name: open-webui\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 volumes:\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - open-webui:/app/backend/data\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 ports:\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 3000:8080\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 env_file:\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - ./open-webui/.env\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 restart: unless-stopped\n    \n    \n    volumes:\n    \u00a0 ollama: {}\n    \u00a0 open-webui: {}", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1oj89tc/docker_compose_for_a_newbie/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "King Charles unveils new memorial to LGBT veterans", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7m8kzgy77o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Crack at an Ancient Puzzle Reignites Debate for Archaeologists", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/world/americas/teotihuacan-writing-mystery.html?unlocked_article_code=1.xE8.fQBj.OvrMQZ_8i4ot&amp;smid=re-nytimes", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Any context management features on the horizon?", "summary": "I don't see context management features on the roadmap, and they'll become more important as the RAG features become more robust, and those are on the roadmap.\n\nOften, a conversation will exceed the context if it goes too long.
