Over the past five years, overall demand for these three languages has slightly declined, and it will be interesting to see if MTPE service demand for these languages follows the same trend in the coming years. \n\nOf course, this data isn\u2019t a universal benchmark. These figures reflect client trends we see in the localization industry, so they aren\u2019t the final word.

Here\u2019s why", "summary": "Hey everyone,\n\nConsidering the amount of existing frameworks and prompting techniques you can find online, it's easy to either miss some key concepts, or simply get overwhelmed with your options. Quite literally a paradox of choice.\n\nAlthough it was a huge time investment, I searched for the best proven frameworks that get the most consistent and valuable results from LLMs, and filtered through it all to get these 7 frameworks.\n\nFirstly, I took **Google's AI Essentials Specialization course** (available online) and scoured through really **long GitHub repositories** from known prompt engineers to build my toolkit. The course alone introduced me to about 15 different approaches, but honestly, most felt like variations of the same basic idea but with special branding.\n\nThen, I tested them all across different scenarios. Copywriting, business strategy, content creation, technical documentation, etc. My goal was to find the ones that were most versatile, since it would allow me to use them for practically anything.\n\nWhat I found was pretty expectable. A majority of frameworks I encountered were just repackaged versions of simple techniques everyone already knows, and that virtually anyone could guess. Another few worked in very specific situations but didn\u2019t make sense for any other use case. But a few still remained, the 7 frameworks that I am about to share with you now.\n\n**Now that I've gotten your trust, here are the 7 frameworks that everyone should be using (if they want results):**\n\n**Meta Prompting:** Request the AI to rewrite or refine your original prompt before generating an answer\n\n**Chain-of-Thought:** Instruct the AI to break down its reasoning process step-by-step before producing an output or recommendation\n\n**Prompt Chaining:** Link multiple prompts together, where each output becomes the input for the next task, forming a structured flow that simulates layered human thinking\n\n**Generate Knowledge:** Ask the AI to explain frameworks, techniques, or concepts using structured steps, clear definitions, and practical examples\n\n**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enables AI to perform live internet searches and combine external data with its reasoning\n\n**Reflexion:** The AI critiques its own response for flaws and improves it based on that analysis\n\n**ReAct:** Ask the AI to plan out how it will solve the task (reasoning), perform required steps (actions), and then deliver a final, clear result\n\n\u2192 For detailed examples and use cases, you can access my best resources for ***free*** on my site. Trust me when I tell you that it would be overkill to dump everything in here. If you\u2019re interested, here is the link:[ AI Prompt Labs](\n\n**Why these 7:**\n\n* Practical **time-savers** vs. *theoretical* concepts\n* Advanced enough that most people don't know them\n* **Consistently** produce measurable improvements\n* Work across different AI models and use cases\n\n**The hidden prerequisite (special bonus for reading):**\n\nBefore any of these techniques can really make a significant difference in your outputs, you must be aware that prompt engineering as a whole is centered around this core concept: Providing **relevant context**.\n\nThe trick isn't just requesting questions, it's structuring your initial context so the AI knows what kinds of clarifications would actually be useful. Instead of just saying \"Ask clarifying questions if needed\", try \"Ask clarifying questions in order to provide the most relevant, precise, and valuable response you can\". As simple as it seems, **this small change makes a significant difference**. Just see for yourself.\n\nAll in all, this isn't rocket science, but it's the difference between getting generic responses and getting something helpful to your actual situation. The frameworks above work great, but they work **exponentially better** when you give the AI enough context to customize them for your specific needs.\n\nMost of this stuff comes directly from Google's specialists and researchers who actually built these systems, not random internet advice or AI-generated framework lists. That's probably why they work so consistently compared to the flashy or cheap techniques you see everywhere else.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mx16o6/after_googles_8_hour_ai_course_and_30_frameworks/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anyone having issues with Notes not showing up?", "summary": "Running 0.6.25 - So as a normal Admin account, I create a new Note, and set it to Public.

Google\u2019s direct pricing was killing my experimentation budget. Then I found out companies are getting free Google credits and reselling access way cheaper.\n\nI\u2019ve been using [these guys]( for the past 3 months - somehow they\u2019re offering Veo3 at 60-70% below Google\u2019s rates. Same exact model, same quality, just way more affordable for iteration testing.\n\n**This changed my entire workflow:**\n\n* Before: Conservative with generations due to cost\n* After: Generate 5-10 variations per concept and select best\n* Result: Dramatically better content for same budget\n\n# Style References That Actually Deliver:\n\n**Camera specs:** \u201cShot on Arri Alexa,\u201d \u201cShot on RED Dragon\u201d\n\n**Director styles:** \u201cWes Anderson style,\u201d \u201cDavid Fincher cinematography\u201d\n\n**Movie references:** \u201cBlade Runner 2049 cinematography,\u201d \u201cMad Max Fury Road style\u201d\n\n**Color grading:** \u201cTeal and orange grade,\u201d \u201cGolden hour cinematic\u201d\n\n**Avoid fluff terms:** \u201ccinematic,\u201d \u201chigh quality,\u201d \u201cprofessional\u201d - they do nothing\n\n# Negative Prompts as Quality Control\n\nAlways include this boilerplate:\n\n    --no watermark --no warped face --no floating limbs --no text artifacts --no distorted hands\n    \n\nPrevents 90% of common AI failures upfront.\n\n# The Workflow That Actually Works:\n\n1. **Plan 10 concepts** on Monday\n2. **Batch generate 3-5 variations** each Tuesday-Wednesday\n3. **Select best results** Thursday\n4. **Create platform-specific versions** Friday\n\nVolume + selection beats perfectionist single-shot attempts every time.\n\n# Platform-Specific Optimization:\n\n**Don\u2019t reformat one video for all platforms.** Create different versions:\n\n* **TikTok:** 15-30 seconds, high energy, obvious AI aesthetic works\n* **Instagram:** Smooth transitions, visual perfection\n* **YouTube Shorts:** 30-60 seconds, educational framing\n\nSame core content, different optimization = 3x better performance.\n\nThe biggest mindset shift: **AI video is about iteration and selection, not divine inspiration.** Build systems for consistent output rather than hoping for lucky single generations.\n\nMost creators optimize for perfect prompts. Smart creators optimize for affordable volume testing.\n\nHope this saves someone the expensive learning curve I went through. What\u2019s been your biggest breakthrough with AI video costs?\n\nhappy to answer questions in the comments &lt;3", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mxb375/how_i_cut_my_ai_video_costs_by_80_and_actualy_got/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI is helping patients successfully appeal denied health insurance claims", "summary": "Insurance denials can feel impossible to fight the appeal process is long, exhausting, and full of jargon.

Put this in the \"How would you like ChatGPT to respond?\" Box. Ex:** From now on, act as my expert creative partner. Your goal is to help me think deeper and overcome creative blocks. Always provide:\n\n1. **A nuanced, detailed answer** that explores the topic beyond a surface-level summary.\n2. **A collaborative, conversational tone.** Ask clarifying questions and use phrases like \"What if we tried...\" or \"That's a great point, and it makes me think of...\"\n3. **At least one alternative perspective or unexpected idea** that I might not have thought of.\n4. **A commitment to maintaining context** across our entire conversation, referencing past points where relevant.\n\nTry to never give short, low-effort, or purely factual answers unless I specifically ask for them. Your primary function is to be an invaluable thinking partner. Try setting this as your custom instruction and see how much more creative and less robotic GPT-5 becomes. This isn't an ultimate fix but its a great workaround for the time being until the GPT-5 model gets more used to your overall personality. I'd love to hear how it works for you in the comments.
