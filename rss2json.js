The candidate of the ruling LIBRE party, Rixi Moncada, came in a distant third.\n\nAsfura ran on a broad pro-business platform saying private investment was necessary to move the country forward, while his political agenda focused on jobs, education and security. He has also signaled he may swap Honduras' allegiance to Taiwan, and away from Beijing.\n\nThe results were so close and the [ballot processing system so chaotic]( that around 15% of the tally sheets, comprising hundreds of thousands of ballots, had to be counted by hand to determine the winner.\n\nIn the weeks following the vote, LIBRE repeatedly called for protests against what they denounced as an \"electoral coup.\" The protests interrupted the manual count, blocking officials from accessing the building where tally sheets were being stored.\n\nThe results were approved by two electoral council members and one deputy, as disputes continued over the razor-thin vote. The third council member, Marlon Ochoa, was not present in the video declaring the winner.\n\nNasralla rejected the CNE's declaration, saying it had excluded ballots that should have been counted, but urged his supporters to remain calm and refrain from any acts of disruption or violence.\n\nThe head of the Honduran Congress also rejected the results.\n\nTrump also threatened to cut off U.S. financial support to Honduras if Asfura did not win and [pardoned former President]( Juan Orlando Hernandez, also of Asfura's National Party, who had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. on drug trafficking and weapons charges.\n\nAmid delays in the count, Trump weighed into the election again alleging fraud without providing evidence and saying there would be \"hell to pay\" if Honduras changed preliminary results that had put Asfura ahead.\n\nTrump's backing of Asfura, experts say, is part of his push to mold a conservative bloc across Latin America, stretching from Nayib Bukele in El Salvador to Javier Milei in Argentina.", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-backed-asfura-wins-honduras-presidency-after-weeks-delays-disputed-2025-12-24/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thailand\u2019s military strikes Cambodian targets amid cease-fire talks - UPI.com", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/12/26/cambodia-thai-fighting/5361766779738/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Arab League welcomes Sudanese gov\u2019t peace plan presented at UN", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/24/arab-league-welcomes-sudanese-govt-peace-plan-presented-at-un", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Court Grants Nigerian Govt\u2019s Request To Reopen Terrorism Case Against Bello Turji\u2019s Alleged Financiers", "summary": "", "link": "https://saharareporters.com/2025/12/22/court-grants-nigerian-govts-request-reopen-terrorism-case-against-bello-turjis-alleged", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Europe's relentless semiconductor decline", "summary": "The ARM instruction set and one of the early leaders in GPUs (PowerVR), came from Europe.
