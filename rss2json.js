The performance was incredible. Complex analysis, long documents, detailed code review - it handled everything brilliantly. Worth every penny of that $200/month premium.\n\nFast forward to now:\n\nCan\u2019t handle long documents anymore  \nLoses context after a few exchanges  \nCode review capability is a shadow of what it was  \nComplex tasks fail constantly\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: OpenAI never published specifications, disabled their own token counting tool for o1 pro, and provided no way to verify anything. Convenient, right?\n\nThink about what\u2019s happening here:\n\nLaunch an amazing service  \nGet businesses hooked and dependent  \nQuietly degrade performance  \nKeep charging premium prices  \nMake it impossible to prove anything changed\n\nWe\u2019re paying TEN TIMES the regular ChatGPT Plus price ($200 vs $20), and they can apparently just degrade the service whenever they want, without notice, without acknowledgment, without any way to verify what we\u2019re actually getting.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about lost productivity or wasted money. This is about a premium service being quietly downgraded while maintaining premium pricing. It\u2019s about a company that expects us to pay $200/month for a black box that keeps getting smaller.\n\nWhat used to take 1 hour now takes 4. What used to work smoothly now requires constant babysitting. Projects are delayed, costs are skyrocketing, and we\u2019re still paying the same premium price for what feels like regular ChatGPT with a fancy badge.\n\nThe most alarming part? OpenAI clearly knows about these changes. They\u2019re not accidental. They\u2019re just counting on the fact that without official specifications or metrics, nobody can prove anything.\n\nThis needs to stop.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing the same issues, make some noise. Share this post. Let them know we notice what\u2019s happening. We shouldn\u2019t have to waste our time documenting their downgrades while paying premium prices for degraded service.\n\nOpenAI: if you need to reduce capabilities, fine. But be transparent about it and adjust pricing accordingly.

In Germany they way you document is different by State in North Rhine Westphalia where I work, we use the so called:\" Rheinische Stellen Kartensystem\" that you can Translation to something like rhenish place card System. Which basically are Paper Cards with every Info.\nWe normally use: arbitrary level excavation. And every Thing gets a number, so:\n1. The Dig gets a number consisting of the Overall administrative Area we dig in e.g. Overrath=OV. The year e.g. 2019 and the number of Digital we are in this year e.g. 319. So the Number looks like this: OV 2019/319.\n2. Every trench or working or when and whatever ever you determenine needs a number gets one. You Start with one ging upwards so the Numbers could Look like this\nOV 2019/319\n3: Work Area(AB)/first Trench\n4: Humus in Work Area 3\n5:Layer of Earth with burnt elements in Work Area 3\n6: Layer of a Clayfloor in Work Area 3 etc.\n\n3. In your subnumbers you write down every Step you take so.\n\nOV 2019/319, \n3.1. Definition as Work Area\n3.2. Laying? Of the first arbitrary level(Planum 1)\n3.4. Picture of the Work Area including [4],[7]&amp;[8]\n3.5. Description of the work area \n3.6. Scetch of the work area including [4],[7]&amp;[8]\n3.7. Finds from the work area ceramics\n3.8. Finds from the work area bones\nEtc.\n\nIf you mention a Number subnumber you have to make a reference on the card for this number.\n\nE.g. \nOV 2019/319\n7.9. Picture taken see [3]-4\n\nSo yeah thats how we document our working stets. A example Picture is up there.
