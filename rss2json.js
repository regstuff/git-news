Convicted of murdering her white employer at age 16. Sentenced to death despite no previous arrests and her claims of self-defense. Executed the day after her 17th birthday.", "summary": "The photo is what caught my attention. I hadn't even read the details of the case. But I saw the photo and I didn't see a cold blooded killer. I saw a scared young girl who looked younger than 16.\n\nAfter reading the details of the case it only became more tragic. My source is the Wikipedia article but it appears very well sourced.\n\nVirginia Christian was born in 1895 to poor black parents in the city of Hampton, Virginia. When she was 13 her mother became paralyzed and Virginia dropped out of school and began working as a laundress for a white woman named Ida Belote. Belote had a reputation for being temperamental and abusive that was so well-known that both Virginia's father and aunt told her not to take the job. But it paid 4 dollars a week and the family needed the money.\n\n  \nOn March 18, 1912 Mrs. Belote visited the Christian family home and accused 16 year old Virginia of stealing a skirt. Virginia's mother told her to go to Mrs. Belote's house to resolve the issue. When Virginia arrived at the house Belote again accused her of stealing a skirt and also accused her of stealing a gold locket. Virginia denied the thefts and threated to quit. Mrs. Belote responded by attacking Virginia with a spittoon. Virginia defended herself by hitting Mrs. Belote in the head with a broom handle and then stuffing a towel 5 inches down her throat causing her to suffocate to death (According to Virginia she put the towel in Mrs. Belote's mouth to stop her screaming). She left the house with Mrs. Belote's pocketbook which contained $4 and a ring. She was arrested later that day and immediately confessed although maintaining that the killing was self-defense.\n\n  \nVirginia was tried before an all white and all male jury who found her guilty and sentenced her to death. Virginia's sentence was highly controversial and everyone from notable civil rights activists to the journalist who recorded her original confession, petitioned the governor to commute her sentence. There were also questions about Virginia's mental capacity as several contemporary writers believed that she was intellectually disabled. But the governor of Virginia denied requests for a mental examination and rejected all appeals for clemency (unsurprisingly he was also a Confederate veteran). So on August 16, 1912 one day after her 17th birthday Virginia Christian was executed by electrocution. One of the last messages she wrote was this:\n\n\"I know that I am getting no more than I deserve. I am prepared to answer for my sins, and I believe that the Lord has forgiven me. I fear that Mrs. Belote may not have been Christian. I blame no one for my situation. I hope to meet Mrs. Belote in heaven. I thank all who have worked on my behalf.\"\n\nThat message makes her death even sadder. Virginia's sentence hasn't been overturned but I'm hoping that her case will soon be overturned like the similar cases of George Stinney and Alexander McClay Williams.\n\nSource: [", "link": "https://i.redd.it/q8ol7mcjx6bf1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Inviting a discussion on easy ways for India to boost its soft power while building a base for future hard power to benefit", "summary": "Outright ideas:  \n  \n- Create and export a ginormous (~20k to 80k) corps of medical professionals and paraprofessionals across the world, much like Cuba but better. Actually formalize it and provide them a huge fleet of white colored C-295s (being made in India now) and dispatch the Indian Medical Corps to any disaster prone area. Work closely with international agencies to set up a Red Cross/Red Crescent/MSF type of operation. Such an operation would also provide an avenue for some of India's \"mujhe doctor banna hai\" folks to actually do doctor type stuff while traveling the world. Give them diplomatic passports and add perks to incentivize them to stop opening clinics in India.         \n- Export India's bureaucratic culture and help build institutions across Sub-Saharan African nations. India's strongest strength, for god or for bad, has been our bureaucracy. Without it, we would have probably fallen by the wayside into a failed state. They preserved the legacy of the Indian Civil Service and actually institutionalize a lot of operational practices (in theory anyway). This is a knowledge bomb we're sitting on and we must help   \n- Export India's railway building expertise all over the world. China builds roads and highways and railways but the trains, I've noticed (like those in Kenya) are usually very high maintenance, fancy gleaming shit. What these countries need is some rugged bullshit rolling stock that can take damage, with some easy-maintenance railway equipment (tracks, signals, OHEs, substations) that they can fix by themselves without needing any future financial assistance  \n- Figure out a way to dedicate a small constellation of weather and remote sensing satellites per nation and begin launching hundreds of satellites for the nations. It will help us gain more expertise working with other tropical/sub-tropical/desertifying nations as well. Look at how many organizations in India can benefit from this:      \n     - India Meteorological Department (IMD): The primary agency responsible for meteorological observations, weather forecasting, and seismology in India.     \n     - Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS): Focuses on providing ocean data, information, and advisory services, including tsunami warnings.    \n     - National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR): Dedicated to coastal research, shoreline management, and understanding coastal ecosystem dynamics.     \n     - Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM): Conducts research on tropical weather phenomena, particularly the Indian monsoon.     \n     - National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF): Specializes in medium-range weather forecasting.     \n     - National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR): Engaged in polar and oceanographic research.     \n     - National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT): Focuses on developing ocean technology.         \n  \nThese take very little effort, have a lot of transferability across third world nations at various stages of growth, and can actually result in tangibly good PR for India if we follow a philosophy of train-educate-transfer-leave. Using these, by the way, is a great way to also build a base to offset Chinese, Russian, French and American/European hegemony in various parts of the third world. It helps us, at the minimum, cultivate human contacts and political contacts, while also helping us develop an unparalleled HUMINT capability. If there's a Chinese project, we can sabotage it, for instance.  \n  \nThis entire rambling post is derived from my unparalleled loathing of China, who are real pains in the ass to India though we have no machinations on the domestic geography of China, we have no independent history of culturally or economically hurting China and despite considerable leverage (Tibet and Taiwan) we have been exceptionally docile in ways that we wouldn't have if it was Pakistan pulling the same shit with us. The constant rankling, needling, sabotage in international forums, cyberattacks on Indian infrastructure etc is getting too much. They need to be paid back, in kind, and put in their place.   \n  \nLmk if you guys have similar ideas too.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ltag2n/inviting_a_discussion_on_easy_ways_for_india_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel launches strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9xdlxp1x7o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for input from recent UK archaeology graduates and field archaeologists", "summary": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m looking for some input/advice from people who\u2019ve recently graduated in the UK with regards to career pathways. \n\nI was previously working as a land surveyor for 6 years and have decided to start an archaeology masters this year as a way to take some experience into a new field I\u2019m more passionate about but i\u2019m having trouble picking a course. \n\nAs a mature student and someone coming from a different background I want to maximise employability.
