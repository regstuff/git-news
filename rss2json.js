The Game Changer: Search Tags\n\nI love me some hash tags! At the bottom of each prompt file: Tags: #code-review #python #concise #technical #work\n\nNow I can find any prompt in seconds.\n\n**Results after 3 months:**\n\n* Cut prompt creation time by 60% (building on previous versions)\n* Stopped recreating the same prompts over and over\n* Can actually find and reuse my best prompts\n* Built a library of 200+ categorized, tested prompts\n\n**What's worked best for you? Anyone using Git for prompt versioning? I'm curious about other approaches - especially for team collaboration.**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lpjfzt/my_prompt_versioning_system_after_managing_200/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Israel] Ben Gvir said seeking partnership with Smotrich to thwart emerging hostage deal", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-said-seeking-partnership-with-smotrich-to-thwart-emerging-hostage-deal/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Communist Jeannette Jara wins Presidential Primary in Chile", "summary": "", "link": "https://havanatimes.org/news/communist-jeannette-jara-wins-primary-in-chile/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Melbourne team demonstrates way to make HIV visible within white blood cells, paving the way to fully clear it from the body", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In March 1998, Amy Lynn Bradley vanished from her cruise ship cabin.

PromptBuild.ai is essentially GitHub meets prompt engineering - version control, testing, and performance analytics all in one place.\n\n**The problem I was solving:**\n- Testing 10+ variations of a prompt and forgetting which performed best\n- No systematic way to track prompt performance over time\n- Collaborating with team members was chaos (email threads, Slack messages, conflicting versions)\n- Different prompts for dev/staging/prod environments living in random places\n\n**Key features built specifically for prompt engineering:**\n- **Visual version timeline** - See every iteration of your prompts with who changed what and why\n- **Interactive testing playground** - Test prompts with variable substitution and capture responses\n- **Performance scoring** - Rate each test run (1-5 stars) and build a performance history\n- **Variable templates** - Create reusable prompts with {{customer_name}}, {{context}}, etc.\n- **Global search** - Find any prompt across all projects instantly\n\n**What's different from just using Git:**\n- Built specifically for prompts, not code\n- Interactive testing interface built-in\n- Performance metrics and analytics\n- No command line needed\n- Designed for non-technical team members too\n\n**Current status:**\n- Core platform is live and FREE (unlimited projects/prompts/versions)\n- Working on production API endpoints (so your apps can fetch prompts dynamically)\n- Team collaboration features coming next month\n\nI've been using it for my own projects for the past month and it's completely changed how I approach prompt development. Instead of guessing, I now have data on which prompts perform best.\n\nWould love to get feedback from this community - what features would make your prompt engineering workflow better?\n\nCheck it out: [promptbuild.ai](\n\nP.S. - If you have a specific workflow or use case, I'd love to hear about it.
