Try them out, they might sharpen your thinking too:\n\n**The Assumption Detector**  \nWhen you\u2019re feeling certain about something:  \nThis one has helped me avoid a few costly mistakes by exposing beliefs I had accepted without question.\n\n    I believe [your belief]. What hidden assumptions am I making? What evidence might contradict this?\n\n**The Devil\u2019s Advocate**  \nWhen you\u2019re a little too in love with your own idea:  \nThis one stung, but it saved me from launching a business idea that had a serious, overlooked flaw.\n\n    I'm planning to [your idea]. If you were trying to convince me this is a terrible idea, what would be your strongest arguments?\n\n**The Ripple Effect Analyzer**  \nBefore making a big move:  \nHelped me realize some longer-term ripple effects of a career decision I hadn\u2019t thought through.\n\n    I'm thinking about [potential decision]. Beyond the obvious first-order effects, what second or third-order consequences should I consider?\n\n**The Fear Dissector**  \nWhen fear is driving your decisions:  \nThis has helped me move forward on things I was irrationally avoiding.\n\n    \"I'm hesitating because I'm afraid of [fear]. Is this fear rational? What\u2019s the worst that could realistically happen?\"\n\n**The Feedback Forager**  \nWhen you\u2019re stuck in your own head:  \nGreat for breaking out of echo chambers and finding fresh perspectives.\n\n    Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking: [insert thought]. What would someone with a very different worldview say about this?\n\n**The Time Capsule Test**  \nWhen weighing a decision you\u2019ll live with for a while:  \nA simple way to step outside the moment and tap into longer-term thinking.\n\n    If I looked back at this decision a year from now, what do I hope I\u2019ll have done\u2014and what might I regret?\n\nEach of these prompts works a different part of your cognitive toolkit. Combined, they\u2019ve helped me think clearer, see further, and avoid some really dumb mistakes.\n\n**By the way\u2014if you're into crafting better prompts or want to sharpen how you use ChatGPT** I built [**TeachMeToPrompt**]( a free tool that gives you instant feedback on your prompt and suggests stronger versions. It\u2019s like a writing coach, but for prompting\u2014super helpful if you\u2019re trying to get more thoughtful or useful answers out of AI.

Few people have already start playing with it this week and thought it might help others hitting the same wall. The gist is:\n\n* You can *automate* prompt/agent optimization, as in, set up a search (Bayesian, evolutionary, etc.) and let it run against your dataset/tasks.\n* Doesn\u2019t care what LLM stack you use\u2014seems to play nice with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, whatever, since it uses LiteLLM under the hood.\n* Not tied to a specific agent framework (which is a relief, too many \u201call-in-one\u201d libraries out there).\n* Results and experiment traces show up in their Opik UI (which is actually useful for seeing *why* something\u2019s working or not).\n\nI have a number of papers dropping on this also over the next few weeks as there are new techniques not shared before like the bayesian few-shot and evolutionary algorithms to optimise prompts and example few-shot messages. \n\nDetails [  \nPypi: [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ksrd5x/we_opensourced_our_agent_optimizer_sdk/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018We stand with India\u2019: Japan, UAE back New Delhi over its global outreach against Pak-backed terror", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/india/we-stand-with-india-japan-uae-back-new-delhi-over-its-global-outreach-against-pak-backed-terror-13890837.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Practicing a new language without feeling awkward?

Here\u2019s what they said:", "summary": "A while ago, I posted in this same subreddit about the pain and joy of vibe coding while trying to build actual products that don\u2019t collapse in a gentle breeze. [One]( [Two]( [Three](\n\nYCombinator drops a guide called [How to Get the Most Out of Vibe Coding.](\n\nFunny thing is: half the stuff they say? I already learned it the hard way, while shipping my projects, tweaking prompts like a lunatic, and arguing with AI like it\u2019s my cofounder)))\n\nHere\u2019s their advice:\n\n**Before You Touch Code:**\n\n1. Make a plan with AI before coding. Like, a real one. With thoughts.\n2. Save it as a markdown doc. This becomes your dev bible.\n3. Label stuff you\u2019re avoiding as *\u201cnot today, Satan\u201d* and throw wild ideas in a \u201clater\u201d bucket.\n\n**Pick Your Poison (Tools):**\n\n1. If you\u2019re new, try Replit or anything friendly-looking.\n2. If you like pain, go full Cursor or Windsurf.\n3. Want chaos? Use both and let them fight it out.\n\n**Git or Regret:**\n\n1. Commit every time something works. No exceptions.\n2. Don\u2019t trust the \u201cundo\u201d button. It lies.\n3. If your AI spirals into madness, nuke the repo and reset.\n\n**Testing, but Make It Vibe:**\n\n1. Integration &gt; unit tests. Focus on what the user sees.\n2. Write your tests before moving on \u2014 no skipping.\n3. Tests = mental seatbelts. Especially when you\u2019re \u201crefactoring\u201d (a.k.a. breaking things).\n\n**Debugging With a Therapist:**\n\n1. Copy errors into GPT. Ask it what it *thinks* happened.\n2. Make the AI brainstorm causes *before* it touches code.\n3. Don\u2019t stack broken ideas. Reset instead.\n4. Add logs. More logs. Logs on logs.\n5. If one model keeps being dumb, try another. (They\u2019re not all equally trained.)\n\n**AI As Your Junior Dev:**\n\n1. Give it proper onboarding: long, detailed instructions.\n2. Store docs locally. Models suck at clicking links.\n3. Show screenshots. Point to what\u2019s broken like you\u2019re in a crime scene.\n4. Use voice input. Apparently, Aqua makes you prompt twice as fast. I remain skeptical.\n\n**Coding Architecture for Adults:**\n\n1. Small files. Modular stuff. Pretend your codebase will be read by actual humans.\n2. Use boring, proven frameworks. The AI knows them better.\n3. Prototype crazy features *outside* your codebase. Like a sandbox.\n4. Keep clear API boundaries \u2014 let parts of your app talk to each other like polite coworkers.\n5. Test scary things in isolation before adding them to your lovely, fragile project.\n\n**AI Can Also Be:**\n\n1. Your DevOps intern (DNS configs, hosting, etc).\n2. Your graphic designer (icons, images, favicons).\n3. Your teacher (ask it to explain its code back to you, like a student in trouble).\n\nAI isn\u2019t just a tool. It\u2019s a second pair of (slightly unhinged) hands.\n\n**You\u2019re the CEO now. Act like it**.\n\nSet context. Guide it. Reset when needed. And don\u2019t let it gaslight you with bad code.\n\n\\---\n\np.s. and I think it\u2019s fair to say \u2014 I\u2019m writing a newsletter where 2,500+ of us are figuring this out together, you can find it [here](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kt0x5y/ycombinator_just_dropped_a_vibe_coding_tutorial/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Working with indigenous remains - America/ Canada", "summary": "Kia ora, \n\nI'm a biological anthropologist from New Zealand.
