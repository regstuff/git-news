It noted that Auschwitz itself was originally created by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland to house ethnic Polish prisoners. Only later did it become an extermination camp for Jews.\n\n\u201cA responsible approach to historical accuracy should take this into account,\u201d wrote the museum, which recommended that the German government study its online course about the history of the camp.\n\nIn total, around 140,000-150,000\u00a0[Poles were deported to Auschwitz](\u00a0and an estimated 70,000-75,000 of those were killed there. In both cases, those figures are second only to Jews in terms of the number of victims of the camp.\n\nMore broadly, during the Nazi-German occupation of Poland from 1939 to 1945, around 6 million Polish citizens were killed, representing 17% of the prewar population \u2013 a higher relative death toll than any other country during the war.
