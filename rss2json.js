Think of it like **Figma meets Google Docs**, but for transcription.\n\n# \ud83c\udfa7\u00a0 Why I Built This?\n\nA while ago, I went through a personal situation, multiple items were stolen from me during a garage sale by ex close-friend of mine in Vancouver. While going back and forth with this person I started recording our conversations to build a strong case of the situation and as police evidence. However, I needed to **analyze and transcribe long recordings one by one** to help piece together details. But the tools I found were either:\n\n* too expensive for multi-hour files,\n* not accurate enough with real-world, noisy audio,\n* or too locked-down to let me edit or reprocess the data how I needed.\n\nWhisper gave me a solid transcription base, but I quickly realized there was **no tool that let me edit transcripts comfortably** across long audios, with speaker diarization, versioning, or collaboration, especially not on a budget.\n\nSo I started building **VerbaticAI**, with the goal of making **accurate, editable, and affordable transcription accessible** to everyone.\n\n# \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Who I Am\n\nI\u2019m a **Computer Science graduate**, and currently working as an SDE at one of the largest financial institutions in the US.

Copy the prompt, paste your problem, and get a strategic action plan.\n\nEver feel like you're just spinning your wheels on a tough problem? Whether it's in your business, career, or a personal project, we all get stuck.\n\nI've been obsessed with using structured thinking to break through these walls. Recently, I came across a framework called the\u00a0**\"Wheel of Problem-Solving,\"**\u00a0which combines four powerful mental models:\n\n* **First-Principles Thinking:**\u00a0Breaking a problem down to its fundamental truths.\n* **Second-Order Thinking:**\u00a0Seeing past the immediate result to find unintended consequences.\n* **Root Cause Analysis:**\u00a0Digging deep to find the\u00a0*real*\u00a0source of the issue, not just the symptoms.\n* **The OODA Loop:**\u00a0A rapid cycle of observing, orienting, deciding, and acting.\n\nOn its own, it's a great mental checklist. But I thought... what if I could combine this with the power of AI?\n\nSo, I built a master prompt designed to force an AI (like Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude) to act as a world-class strategic consultant and analyze a problem from all four of these angles.\n\nThe goal is to stop getting generic, surface-level advice and start getting a deep, actionable strategic plan. I've used it on my own business challenges, and the clarity it provides is insane.\n\nThe Master Prompt to Turn AI Into a Problem-Solving Genius\n\n**Instructions:**\u00a0Copy the text below, replace\u00a0[YOUR TOUGHEST PROBLEM HERE]\u00a0with your specific challenge, and paste it into your AI of choice.\n\n    AI Role: You are a world-class strategic consultant and business coach. Your goal is to help me deconstruct a complex problem using a multi-faceted approach called the \"Wheel of Problem-Solving.\" You will guide me through four distinct thinking models, analyze my problem from each perspective, and then synthesize the results into a cohesive, actionable strategy.\n    \n    My Core Problem:\n    [YOUR TOUGHEST PROBLEM HERE. Be specific. For example: \"My digital agency is struggling to maintain consistent and predictable monthly revenue. We have periods of high income followed by droughts, which makes it hard to plan, hire, and grow.\"]\n    \n    ---\n    \n    Now, let's begin the analysis. Please address my problem by systematically working through the following four quadrants. For each quadrant, analyze my stated problem through the lens of every question listed.\n    \n    ### Quadrant 1: First Principles Thinking\n    (Strip everything back and start from zero.)\n    \n    1.  What do we know for sure is true about this problem? (List only objective facts.)\n    2.  What are the underlying assumptions I might be making? (Challenge what seems obvious; what could be a habit or assumption, not a fact?)\n    3.  If we were to build a solution from scratch, with no legacy constraints, what would it look like?\n    4.  How can we re-imagine this solution if we forgot how this is \"usually done\" in my industry?\n    5.  What is the absolute simplest, most direct version of solving this?\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### Quadrant 2: Second-Order Thinking\n    (Zoom out and see the bigger picture and potential consequences.)\n    \n    1.  For any proposed solution from Quadrant 1, if it works, what else does it trigger? (What are the immediate, secondary effects?)\n    2.  What does the situation and the proposed solution look like in 6 months? 2 years? 5 years?\n    3.  Are we at risk of solving a short-term pain but creating a larger long-term problem?\n    4.  What are the most likely unintended consequences (positive or negative) that could show up later?\n    5.  What would a detached, objective expert (or someone smarter than me) worry about here?\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### Quadrant 3: Root Cause Analysis\n    (Fix the entire system, not just the surface-level symptom.)\n    \n    1.  Describe precisely what goes wrong when this problem manifests. (What are the specific symptoms and triggers?)\n    2.  What is the first domino that falls? (What's the initial event or breakdown that leads to the problem?)\n    3.  Apply the \"5 Whys\" technique: Ask \"Why?\" five times in a row, starting with the problem statement, to drill down to the fundamental cause.\n    4.  Where have we tried to solve this in the past and failed or made it worse? (What can we learn from those attempts?)\n    5.  What systemic factors (e.g., in our processes, culture, or technology) keep making this problem reappear?\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### Quadrant 4: The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)\n    (Bias towards immediate, intelligent action.)\n    \n    1.  Observe: What is the raw data? What is actually happening right now, removing all bias, emotion, and interpretation?\n    2.  Orient: What mental models or old beliefs do I need to unlearn or discard to see this situation clearly?\n    3.  Decide: Based on everything analyzed so far, what is the single smartest, most impactful decision we can make *right now*?\n    4.  Act (Hypothetically): What is the smallest, fastest, lowest-risk test we can run immediately to validate our decision?\n    5.  Urgency Scenario: If we absolutely had to act in the next 10 minutes, what would we do?\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### Final Synthesis &amp; Strategic Recommendation\n    \n    After analyzing my problem through all four quadrants, please provide a final summary.\n    \n    1.  **Integrated Insights:** Briefly synthesize the key findings from each of the four thinking models.\n    2.  **Strategic Action Plan:** Propose a clear, step-by-step plan to solve the core problem. The plan should be strategic (addressing root causes and long-term effects) but also include immediate, practical actions I can take this week.\n\n# How to Use This &amp; Which AI is Best?\n\n**Tips for Best Results:**\n\n1. **Be Specific:**\u00a0The more detailed you are in the\u00a0[YOUR TOUGHEST PROBLEM HERE]\u00a0section, the better the AI's analysis will be. Don't just say \"I have money problems.\" Say \"My SaaS business has a 15% monthly churn rate for customers who have been with us for less than 90 days.\"\n2. **Treat it as a Conversation:**\u00a0If the AI gives you a good point in one quadrant, you can ask it to elaborate before moving on.\n3. **Challenge the AI:**\u00a0If you disagree with an assumption it makes, tell it! Say, \"That's an interesting point in Q1, but I don't think X is a fact. Let's assume Y instead and see how that changes the analysis.\"\n\n**Which AI Model Works Best?**\n\nThis prompt is designed to be model-agnostic and should work well on all major platforms:\n\n* **Gemini:**\u00a0Excellent for this kind of creative, structured reasoning. I'd recommend using the latest model (currently\u00a0**Gemini 2.5 Pro**) as it's particularly strong at synthesis and following complex instructions. Its ability to integrate different lines of thought for the \"Final Synthesis\" is top-tier.\n* **ChatGPT:**\u00a0The o3 model is a powerhouse for logical deduction and analysis. It will meticulously go through each step and provide very thorough, well-reasoned answers. It's a reliable choice for a detailed breakdown.\n* **Claude (Anthropic):**\u00a0**Claude 4 Opus**\u00a0is another fantastic option. It's known for its large context window and strong ability to understand nuance and provide thoughtful, detailed prose. It might give you a more \"human-like\" consultative tone. I have found it to produce the best insights with this prompt.\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the premium versions of these three (Gemini 2,5 Pro, GPT o3, Claude 4 Opus). They all have the reasoning capacity to handle this prompt effectively. The \"best\" one might come down to your personal preference for the AI's writing style. I highly recommend using this with paid versions of any of those three tools as you really need the larger context window of paid plans to make this work well.\n\nLet me know what problems you try to solve with it and how it goes!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1ma7f00/heres_a_prompt_to_help_solve_your_toughest/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Missouri bill banning child marriage, seizure of foster kids\u2019 benefits is signed into law", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/10/missouri-ban-on-child-marriage-taking-foster-kids-benefits-now-law/84536026007/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Neanderthals were not \u2018hypercarnivores\u2019 and feasted on maggots", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/25/neanderthals-feasted-maggots-science-nutrition", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Has anyone gotten any of the Token / Cost Counters to work?

That is, it reads the texts and collects segments in one language and others in another.\n\nI did some research, and came across papers like Segment-any-Text but it seems primarily concerned with breaking text into units like sentences and paragraphs, and not my problem which is taking these segments by language.\n\nPrecisely, I am looking for a technique to solve this problem.\n\nGiven an input text:\n    Input\n    Aujourd'hui, nous allons parler des citrons et des limes.

The goal is to have the UI on a server, but the functions (tools) run locally on my host computer via an MCP (mcpo) server.\nA simple use case would be:\n\n- User: \"Can you close my YouTube tabs?\"\n- LLM: Calls list_all_tabs() tool. \ud83d\udd0e\nAnalyzes the output to find tabs with \"YouTube\" in the title.\nCalls close_browser_tab(tab_id) for each identified tab.\nVerifies the tabs are closed. \u2705\n- Responds: \"Done! I found and closed 3 YouTube tabs for you.\"\n\nI have the MCP server set up and the functions are working, but I've run into a couple of issues/roadblocks.\n\n\n## The Problems\n\nOverly Aggressive Tool Use: The LLM doesn't seem to grasp the right context for using tools. For example, if I ask it to \"open a new Google tab,\" it correctly calls the open_tab function. However, if I follow up with a completely unrelated question like \"tell me a joke,\" it sometimes (more often then not) tries to call the open_tab function again before answering. It's struggling to differentiate between commands that need tools and general conversation.\n\nMy idea is to integrating MCP with Pipelines for Efficient Chains: I'm not sure about the best way to hook my MCP functions into an OpenWebUI pipeline to create an efficient and accurate chain of thought. My goal is to make the model reason about the steps it needs to take, use the tools sequentially, and verify the results without excessive \"thinking\" steps or getting stuck in loops. I want it to correctly understand the user's intent and act on it precisely.\n\n## My Questions\n\nIs there a way to make it more robust in distinguishing between a command and a simple query?\nWhat's the best practice for structuring an OpenWebUI pipeline with MCP functions (that are local and not on the OpenWebUI server) to achieve a reliable chain of action? Are there specific pipeline configurations that you'd recommend for this kind of agent-like behavior?\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1m9sm3n/seeking_advice_chaining_local_mcp_functions_with/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "during 9/11, many people took photos without fully grasping the scale of what was happening.", "summary": "some were already taking casual pictures when the first tower was hit, assuming it was an accident, not an attack. others acted out of shock or instinct, trying to document the moment as it unfolded. the result was a surreal mix of normalcy and disaster - images of people smiling with the burning towers behind them.\nthese photos have since become haunting reminders of how confusion, disbelief, and the urge to document history can all happen at once.\nalthough phone cameras weren't common yet, disposables and digital cameras captured everything.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ma09io", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gaza: 'I witnessed war crimes,' former worker at GHF aid site tells BBC", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cy8k8045nx9o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Job market in the UK", "summary": "I'm a current undergrad in the USA studying anthropology/archaeology and while I still have three years left before I get my degree, I want to go ahead and start thinking about jobs and further education.
