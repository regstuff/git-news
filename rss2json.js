Normally, serving in a foreign military without consent from the Polish authorities is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nOn Friday, the proposed new \u201claw on the non-punishment of volunteers defending the freedom and independence of Ukraine\u201d was supported almost unanimously by the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament. Only the far-right did not vote in favour.\n\nPolish volunteers fighting for Ukraine \u201cdeserve praise, not the threat of punishment,\u201d declared one of the originators of the bill, Ma\u0142gorzata Tracz, in the Sejm.\n\nThe bill, which was first proposed by MPs from the centrist Civic Coalition (KO), Poland\u2019s main ruling party, in December 2024, would provide immunity for Poles who have joined the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nThe\u00a0[initial bill](\u00a0was intended to cover those who have served since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. However, the\u00a0[latest version](\u00a0covers the period from April 2014, when Russian-backed separatists began the war in Donbas against the Ukrainian government.\n\nPolish citizens or foreigners residing in Poland who have served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine during that period would be granted immunity from prosecution on the condition that they notify the defence ministry upon their return to Poland.\n\nThose who have already been sentenced for fighting in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces are also granted an amnesty. It is not known how many such convictions have been issued, as no such statistics are kept, notes news service WNP.\u00a0\n\nThe authors of the bill argue that, \u201cin the existing international context, the participation of a Polish citizen in Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russian aggression cannot be perceived as a violation of the constitutional obligations of loyalty to Poland, concern for the common good, or obligation to defend the homeland\u201d.\n\nWork on the bill involved a rare degree of bipartisanship among Poland\u2019s often deeply divided political parties. That was reflected in the vote in the Sejm, where the bill was supported by both the ruling coalition \u2013 which stretches from left to centre right \u2013 and the main national-conservative opposition party, Law and Justice (PiS).\n\nHowever, all MPs present from the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) group abstained from voting, while all three lawmakers from the radical-right Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP) party led by\u00a0[Grzegorz Braun](\u00a0voted against the bill. Both those groups are\u00a0[critical of Ukraine](\n\nThe bill now moves to the upper-house Senate, which can delay legislation and suggest amendments, but cannot block it.\n\nOnce approved by parliament, it would then pass to President Karol Nawrocki, who can sign it into law, veto it, or send it to the constitutional court for assessment.\n\nNawrocki has not publicly taken a position on the bill. He was elected to the presidency last year with the support of PiS but also enjoys good relations with Confederation, and has sometimes taken a\u00a0[tougher line on Ukraine than PiS]( However, the president is also clear that Ukraine must be supported against Russia.\n\nAndrzej Podg\u00f3rski, spokesman for the so-called Polish Legion, an organisation of Polish volunteers fighting for Ukraine, says that its members have been pushing for such a law for a long time.\n\n\u201cMany of these volunteers who are fighting for Ukraine, besides the daily challenges of just surviving from day to day, also have this worry about what will happen when I return home,\u201d he said, quoted by news website Gazeta.pl. \u201cIt\u2019s important to provide them with this psychological peace of mind.\u201d\n\nThere are no precise data on how many Poles have fought in Ukraine, but [Gazeta.pl]( cites estimates that the proposed law would benefit several hundred people.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/14/polish-parliament-approves-legal-amnesty-for-poles-fighting-in-ukraines-armed-forces/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iranian security use dragnet spanning the entire country to arrest protesters", "summary": "The Iranian [security agents]( came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family.

University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to [President Masoud Pezeshkian](\n\nThey are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities [imposed an internet blackout]( and reports leak out only with difficulty.\n\nThe Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.\n\nGholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran\u2019s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters \u201cterrorists\u201d and calling for fast-tracked punishments.\n\nSince then, \u201cdetentions have been very widespread because it\u2019s like a whole suffocation of society,\u201d said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother\u2019s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters\u2019 relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.\n\nIn past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-crackdown-arrests-9de7c65d17920dc43568d3f025fed2cd", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Overcrowding in Swiss prisons reaches critical levels", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/various/overcrowding-in-swiss-prisons-reaches-critical-levels/90946709", "author": "None"}, {"title": "the SAVE Act passed the House, which would require married women to have a passport to vote, but the state department is preventing places from processing them", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/nonprofit-libraries-ordered-by-state-department-to-stop-processing-passport-applications", "author": "None"}, {"title": "President again vetoes government bill on regulating crypto-assets market in Poland", "summary": "President Karol Nawrocki has for the second time vetoed a government bill that aimed to regulate the crypto-assets market in Poland and bring the country in line with EU rules.

However, besides this amendment, the legislation was virtually unchanged.\n\nIt still required firms operating in the industry to submit information on their activities to the KNF, which would be empowered to impose sanctions if necessary. The law would also have introduced criminal liability for offences relating to crypto-assets.\n\nWhen vetoing the first bill in December, Nawrocki said that these measures are too onerous, lack transparency, and pose a \u201creal threat to the freedoms of Poles\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the veto, government spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka wrote on social media: \u201cIf anyone loses their savings due to a lack of regulation and oversight, political responsibility falls squarely on the presidential palace.\u201d\n\nIn response, Nawrocki\u2019s chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, told Sz\u0142apka that, \u201cwith his first veto, the president gave you the chance to improve this bad law\u2026The responsibility is yours\u201d. He noted that Nawrocki has expressed his openness to working with the government on a new, better bill.\n\nHowever, foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski said that Nawrocki had not fulfilled his promise to present a crypto-regulation bill of his own. He sarcastically accused the president of showing \u201ctouching loyalty towards sponsors, both foreign and domestic\u201d, referring to claims that Polish conservatives have ties to crypto firms.\n\nInterior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski on Friday told broadcaster RMF that the ruling coalition would not stop in its attempts to regulate the crypto market, but he did not specify what steps would be taken.\n\nPreviously, deputy finance minister Jurand Drop has warned that, if Poland does not designate an authority to oversee the crypto market by 1 July 2026, firms will not be able to register in Poland and will instead move to other EU countries, resulting in lower tax revenues for the state.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/13/president-again-vetoes-government-bill-on-regulating-crypto-assets-market-in-poland/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How is working in this industry like?", "summary": "", "link": "/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1r5fh4s/how_is_working_in_this_industry_like/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\udc4bk", "summary": "", "link": "/r/burp_huh/comments/1r5x8ms/k/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
