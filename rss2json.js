I have worked as a Localization Engineer for 6+ years, and I am finishing a Master's Degree in Data Science, so I have a good technical foundation in Python programming, and some in databases, linear algebra, statistics, and all that.\n\nMy objective is to get into the NLP + AI Engineering area, but my doubt is if, maybe, my expertise is not enough, either in Data Science, or in NLP, so I am thinking about expanding my NLP knowledge with a postgraduate degree in NLP before continuing with my Data Science master's.\n\nI don't have much time to find an internship (I tried to find one in Data Science, unsuccessfully until now), so my plan is to finish the postgraduate degree in 6 months or less. It is more linguist-focused, but at least they can provide some job offers related to the field.\n\nMy doubt is, if a Computational Linguist is more language than technical knowledge focused, but I want to specialize more on the code and technology itself, my guess is that an AI / ML / NLP Engineer should be my target, right? If any of you are working into this area, what did you do or study in order to be eligible for these kinds of positions? Do you think the market is going to be profitable for these positions, even if the LLMs bubble could burst anytime soon?\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ls2qtz/computational_linguistics_or_ainlp_engineering/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Squad a strategic boon for India and the Quad", "summary": "", "link": "https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/07/04/squad-a-strategic-boon-for-india-and-the-quad/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Openwebui Air Gapped", "summary": "I would like to run openwebui offline (air gapped).
