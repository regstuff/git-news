It hopes to introduce the measures this year.\n\n\u201cFollowing the example of some other countries, Poland should introduce a regulation that cuts off young people aged under 16 from social media,\u201d deputy digital affairs minister Dariusz Standerski told broadcaster Polsat News.\n\n\u201cThis year we will have such tools, so I believe this year is the right time to introduce such a regulation,\u201d added Standerski.\n\nThe deputy minister said that both Poland and the European Union more broadly have \u201cneglected\u201d regulation of social media over the last 15 years, resulting in a situation now where \u201cmany such portals are already beyond control\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to catch up, but there are many challenges,\u201d he added. \u201cFor example, this year we want to address age verification in social media and other portals, to introduce technical solutions that will protect young people from what lurks on social media.\u201d\n\nAsked for further details, Standerski said that such a tool would be used when someone was creating a social-media account. Instead of simply having to declare their age without verification, a window would appear asking the user to confirm their age.\n\nThen, \u201ca credential will be generated within our digital identity wallet, which will transmit only this single piece of information from the device: whether the user is over or under the age of 13 or 15\u201d. This would be done \u201cwith the highest level of security\u201d, he added.\n\nStanderski noted that other EU countries are also testing such systems, and said that Poland is coordinating with them. The European Commission is also working on a harmonised system for online age verification across the bloc.\n\nIn November, the European Parliament adopted a report calling for an EU-wide minimum age of 16 for access to social media (though allowing 13- to 15-year-olds access with parental consent) and stronger measures to protect minors from online threats.\n\nA survey conducted last year by Eurobarometer, an EU polling agency, found that 92% of Europeans favour \u201cputting in place age assurance mechanisms to restrict age-inappropriate content\u201d.\n\nLast month, Australia became the first country to prohibit people aged under 16 from holding social media accounts. Platforms that fail to enforce the new rules face fines of up to A$49.5 million (\u20ac28.3 million).\n\nA number of EU countries, including Italy and Greece, have said that they favour following the Australian model and introducing similar restrictions, reports Euronews.\n\nIn November, Denmark\u2019s government announced plans to ban under-15s from social media, though said that it would take months to pass the relevant legislation. France is also planning to introduce similar legislation in early 2026.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/05/poland-hopes-to-introduce-measures-blocking-children-from-social-media-this-year/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Switzerland Freezes Assets of Maduro and People Close to Him", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-freezes-assets-of-maduro-and-people-close-to-him/90727030", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU 'looking' into Grok's AI for sexually explicit childlike image generation", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2026/01/05/eu-looking-into-grok-s-ai-for-sexually-explicit-childlike-image-generation_6749104_4.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PM Orb\u00e1n stands alone once more in the EU with rejecting key statement about Venezuela", "summary": "[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1q52tsu/pm_orb\u00e1n_stands_alone_once_more_in_the_eu_with/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "10 People Convicted of Cyberbullying Brigitte Macron, Wife of French President", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/world/europe/france-brigitte-macron-cyberbullying-trial-owens.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Turkish banks sell record $1.5B in bad loans in 2025 as household debt pressures mount", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/turkish-banks-sell-record-15b-in-bad-loans-in-2025-as-household-debt-pressures-mount-3212439", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At Least 30 Killed in Gunmen Attack on Nigerian Market", "summary": "", "link": "https://verity.news/story/2026/at-least-killed-in-gunmen-attack-on-nigerian-market?p=re4119", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
