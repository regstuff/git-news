I would like to know your thoughts on these points:\n\n1. Will I be able to get a good job after graduation in UK? I know that Edinburgh is one of the best universities in UK for NLP but UK is under a recession and jobs are very very scarce. I have been hearing this from a lot of other people as well. (I am an international student btw)\n\n2. I am also interested in pursuing research, but with only the program being 1 year, I need to work for another year atleast since application deadlines for PhDs will be very early into my program (2 months) and I won't have much to show + won't have reccos from profs at Edinburgh. \n\n3. I am enthusiastic about working on applications of NLP but I am scared choosing a degree in this sub topic might decrease the number of opportunities I have access to. For example, an MSc ML/AI degree might have more opportunities at just a Lang Tech degree. I have a general interest towards the ML/AI domain of Computer Science.\n\n4. I might have an option of working as an RA for a NLP lab at a premier research institute in my country. Should I wait a year and apply to more prestigious universities like CMU and UWash? They both have very good Lang Tech programs and obviously offer may more opportunities.\n\nMy background: 9.2 CGPA from a local university, multiple internships (AI/ML), 2 published papers (Q2 journal and Unranked conference), currently working as a RA in a very good research university, again in AI domain.\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you guys can give me some advice on these points.

However, much prior  interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich  semantic information, suggesting that editing representations might be a  more powerful alternative. Here, we pursue this hypothesis by  developing a family of **Representation Finetuning** (**ReFT**)  methods. ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and learn  task-specific interventions on hidden representations. We define a  strong instance of the ReFT family, **Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT**  (**LoReFT**). LoReFT is a drop-in replacement for existing PEFTs and learns  interventions that are 10x-50x more parameter-efficient than prior  state-of-the-art PEFTs. We showcase LoReFT on eight commonsense  reasoning tasks, four arithmetic reasoning tasks, Alpaca-Eval v1.0, and  GLUE. In all these evaluations, LoReFT delivers the best balance of  efficiency and performance, and almost always outperforms  state-of-the-art PEFTs.
