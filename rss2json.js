**en\\_core\\_web\\_sm**\u00a0from spaCy\n\nI'm new to NLP and machine learning and could use some guidance on a couple of points:\n\n1. **Comparing the Tokenizers:**\n   * What metrics or methods should I use to compare these two tokenizers effectively?\n   * Any suggestions on what specific aspects to look at (e.g., token length distribution, vocabulary size, handling of out-of-vocabulary words)?\n2. **Entropy / Information Value for Sorting Tokens:**\n   * How do I calculate the entropy or information value for tokens?\n   * Which formula should I use to sort the top 1000 tokens based on their entropy or information value?\n\nAny help or resources to deepen my understanding would be greatly appreciated.

They also criticized the AI for being biased against minorities and for lacking the context, life experience, and emotion that are essential to good comedy.\r\n\r\n3/ The researchers suggest that language models should be made more responsive to the needs of creative communities.
