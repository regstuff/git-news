The names are usually long-winded and technical-sounding and not what people use in regular parlance (or in news articles) to refer to those laws. For example, there is a law called \"law about the self-determination in regard to the gender designation and for changing other regulations\" (\"Gesetz \u00fcber die Selbstbestimmung in Bezug auf den Geschlechtseintrag und zur \u00c4nderung weiterer Vorschriften\"), but people only call it \"self determination law\" (\"Selbstbestimmungsgesetz\"). There is no universal rule by which the common name is derived from the official name, and oftentimes, there isn't even one universally agreed-upon common name, but a number of (similar) ways by which people refer to the law (but almost never by its full, official title). \n\n  \nFor each law, I want to query a news api for articles pertaining to that law. I want to get as many relevant hits as possible, i.e. I want to craft the best (or as good as I can achieve) search query for each law.\n\n  \nSo far, I have used spaCy to lemmatize the titles and discard all words that are not nouns / propper nouns. I have then created a list of nouns that are very common across many law's titles and eliminated those as well. Even so, many superfluous nouns slip through the cracks and muddy up the search results because they are not sufficiently common in my dataset to be excluded on that basis (e.g., in the above example, the word \"Bezug\" (\"regard\") gets included in the search query).\n\n  \nThere are other complications as well:\n\nSometimes, it might be prudent to use only part of a word, e.g. the law's title might contain the words \"Haushaltsjahr 2024\" (budget year 2024), but \"Haushalt 2024\" (2024 budget) would be the better search term.\n\nSometimes, a law's title will be very long with many nouns, thus making the search query overly long / specific, but there is no easy way of programatically telling which nouns to drop from the query.\n\nIt is also possible that the same word would make a good inclusion in the search query for some laws, but not for others. E.g. in the above example \"law about the self-determination in regard to the gender designation and for changing other regulations\", I would not want to include the word \"changing\" in the search query, as it only relates to the vague and unspecific \"other regulations\" that happen to also be mentioned in the official title. On the other hand, there is also a law called \"law for changing the basic law\" (\"Gesetz zur \u00c4nderung des Grundgesetzes\"), where inclusion of the word \"changing\" in the search query seems pretty mandatory.\n\n  \nSimply running a number of different potential search queries against the news api and checking which one gets the most results doesn't work either. This would tend to favor the query with the fewest words, but that query may well produce results that are not relevant to the actual law.\n\n  \nI thought about trying to use a LLM for this, but I don't have the training data for that (I only have the law's titles, but not ideal search queries for each law to traing the LLM on).\n\n  \nAny ideas as to how I might approach this would be greatly appreciated!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1i2ru07/how_to_generate_a_good_search_query_from_a_given/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "An Israeli lawyer has filed submissions to the international criminal court (ICC) alleging incitement to genocide against Palestinians by eight Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/13/israel-gaza-war-ceasefire-hostage-deal-talks-latest-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67852f248f089497427ace2c#block-67852f248f089497427ace2c", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Religious Zionism says will quit coalition if no return to war after deal\u2019s 1st phase", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/religious-zionism-says-will-quit-coalition-if-no-return-to-war-after-deals-1st-phase/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Question] [Entity Resolution] How would I design a test which can measure the accuracy of an Entity Resolution method?", "summary": "Hello, I hope this is the right place to ask this!

It can't give Bangaladesh anything. It hasn't even apologized for its crimes. But, still government in Dhaka is so keen on deepening ties with Islamabad. Why is it so? If Bangladesh want tech, investments, factories, manufacturing units, they have China, Russia, West Asia, South East Asia, US, The West, etc etc. There is literally 0 need for warm relationship with Pakistan. \nPeople say it's all about self interest of the nation, what's the interest in this?
