One far-right leader even entered the hospital where it took place and tried to perform a citizen\u2019s arrest on the doctor. However, he himself is now facing criminal charges for assault over the incident.\n\nUnder Poland\u2019s abortion laws, which are among the strictest in Europe, abortion is only allowed in two circumstances: if the pregnancy resulted from a criminal act, such as rape or incest; or if it threatens the mother\u2019s life or health.\n\nIn the case in question, a pregnant woman \u2013\u00a0identified by\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*, the newspaper that first reported the story, as Anita \u2013 learned late in her pregnancy that her child might suffer from congenital bone fragility.\n\nDespite psychiatric certification indicating a risk to her mental health, Anita\u2019s request for an abortion was denied by the hospital in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a where she sought treatment. Instead, she was placed in solitary psychiatric confinement against her will.\n\nEventually, a doctor, Gizela Jagielska, at a hospital in Ole\u015bnica agreed to perform the abortion, which took place in October 2024, when Anita was in her ninth month of pregnancy.\n\nProsecutors in Ole\u015bnica subsequently launched an investigation to determine whether the abortion had been carried out in violation of the law. However, on Wednesday they announced that they had dropped the case after determining no wrongdoing.\n\nThey gave no details of the basis on which their decision had been made beyond that they had found a \u201clack of the elements of a prohibited act\u201d.\n\nLast year, after Poland\u2019s ruling coalition\u00a0[failed to agree](\u00a0on how to liberalise the abortion law, the government\u00a0[published guidelines](\u00a0for doctors and prosecutors, with the aim of ensuring that they \u201ctake the women\u2019s side\u201d when making decisions on the issue\n\nIn cases where the woman\u2019s life or health is deemed at risk from a pregnancy, Polish law does not impose any time limits on abortion. However, Anita\u2019s case prompted the Polish Society of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (PTGiP) to\u00a0[call on the health ministry](\u00a0to clarify the legal interpretation of abortion regulations.\n\nOn Tuesday this week, before the prosecutors had publicly announced their decision, Jagielska revealed on social media that she was leaving the hospital in Ole\u015bnica after her contract was not renewed.\n\n\u201cAfter 10 years of building the maternity ward in Ole\u015bnica from scratch, you will no longer find me there. This is not my decision,\u201d she said in a recording posted on Facebook. Her husband, the head physician of the same department, is also leaving his position.\n\nThe pair were among doctors whose contacts were not being renewed after a public recruitment process held in accordance with regulations, the hospital authorities told newspaper\u00a0*Fakt.*\n\nIn an interview with broadcaster Tok FM, Jagielska said that she believed the decision to remove her and her husband had \u201cbeen planned for some time\u201d and that \u201cpolitics might have played a role\u201d. For the hospital, \u201cit seems that it\u2019s simply more convenient for me not to be there\u201d.\n\nIn April this year, Jagielska was targeted by far-right leader Grzegorz Braun, who at the time was standing as a candidate in Poland\u2019s presidential elections (where he eventually\u00a0[finished fourth]( with 6.3%% of the vote.\n\nBraun entered the hospital in Ole\u015bnica, confronted the doctor, and attempted to make a citizen\u2019s arrest.\n\nFollowing a separate investigation into that incident, prosecutors decided to bring charges against Braun for deprivation of liberty (by preventing the doctor from leaving her office), violating the doctor\u2019s bodily integrity (by pushing her and holding her down), as well as insulting and slandering her.\n\nAs an MEP, Braun enjoys immunity from prosecution. However, following a request from Poland\u2019s prosecutor general, the European Parliament last month\u00a0[voted overwhelmingly](\u00a0to strip Braun of immunity", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/11/prosecutors-drop-case-against-polish-doctor-who-performed-abortion-in-ninth-month-of-pregnancy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pulp Fiction actor Peter Greene found dead in New York apartment", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/13/pulp-fiction-actor-peter-greene-found-dead-in-new-york-apartment", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Singapore signs Pax Silica Declaration on AI, global tech supply chain", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-signs-us-led-pax-silica-declaration-on-ai-global-tech-supply-chain", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kim Jong-un admits North Korean troops clearing landmines for Russia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/13/north-korea-troops-cleared-landmines-russia-kim-jong-un", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Belarus Frees Prominent Political Prisoners as U.S. Lifts Some Trade Sanctions", "summary": "This is the second batch this year, the first batch of political prisoners was released in September, and included most notably Sergei Tikhanovsky, whose wife won the 2020 presidential election but was denied the victory.

The Russian foreign ministry has promised there will be \u201cconsequences\u201d for Poland.\n\nThe news was first broken by Polish broadcaster RMF, which identified the man only as Aleksandr B. in accordance with Polish privacy law. Polish authorities later confirmed the arrest.\n\nHe was reportedly detained last week at a hotel in Warsaw while travelling from the Netherlands to the Balkans, where he had been due to give a series of lectures.\n\nKyiv alleges that the man led search teams in Russian-occupied Crimea and carried out unauthorised excavations at the Ancient City of Myrmekion in Kerch. Ukrainian investigators say the work caused partial destruction of the cultural heritage site.\n\nAccording to Polish media, Ukrainian prosecutors are now preparing a formal extradition request, after which a Polish court will decide whether to hand him over. The suspect faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was later questioned by prosecutors in Warsaw, who then sought his provisional detention under extradition rules and the Polish-Ukrainian legal assistance agreement. A court approved the request and ordered that he be held for 40 days, RMF reports.\n\nThe spokesman for Poland\u2019s security services, Jacek Dobrzy\u0144ski, confirmed the arrest, which, he told the Polish Press Agency (PAP), happened on 4 December.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe proceedings concern illegal archaeological excavations conducted between 2014 and 2019 in the territories of Ukraine currently occupied by Russia\u201d.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said representatives of the Russian embassy visited the man and are in contact with his defence team, reported Russian news agency Interfax.
