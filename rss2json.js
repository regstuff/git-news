What makes these prompts unique is their user-centered, conversational design:\n\n* Interactive: Instead of one-shot prompting, these templates guide models through an iterative chat with you.\n* Structured Questioning: The AI asks questions focused on specific aspects of your project.\n* User Confirmation: The prompts instruct the AI to verify its understanding and direction with you before moving on or making (unwanted) interpretations.\n* Context Analysis: Many templates instruct the AI to cross-reference input for consistency.\n* Adaptive: The templates help you think through aspects you might have missed, while allowing you to maintain control over the final direction.\n\nThese combine the best of both worlds: Human agency and machine intelligence and structure.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n[ (Bonus prompt resource)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k8f80c/httpsgithubcomtechnomadcodeopensourcepromptlibrary/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
