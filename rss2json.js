I\u2019m tired and uninspired by what the material world offers. It\u2019s devoid of anything meaningful. Just reckless hedonism, vanity, ego, idolatry, malice, Gluttony and self centeredness. The human condition is an ugly one indeed on the whole, collectively speaking. We are taught from a young age to be competitive and to reap what we can from our pursuits. But when all is said and done, when we get the 6 figure salary, the collection of sports cars, the Rolex, the custom indoor jacuzzi, the gorgeous women, whatever it may be, we still feel an emptiness inside. It\u2019s like having an itch but you don\u2019t know how to scratch it. Excess doesn\u2019t fulfil us. The way we\u2019ve shaped our societies leaves many souls disillusioned. Surely, this isn\u2019t the way. Surely there is more. I want that more. I want to reach the final frontier of the senses and beyond. I want meaning. True meaning. Sadly I feel dependant on alcohol, drugs because of said emptiness.  Because of real trauma. I feel like one cannot awaken with chemicals clouding oneself but I do not have the strength to quit. I do not want to stop taking medication or recreational substances because I fear of what remains under what I mask. I fear becoming suicidal again\u2026. But the spiritual path is the only thing in this life that is pure. Whatever the Buddha tapped into. Whatever the Yogis tapped into. Indeed whatever Sadhguru tapped into.

And this is my honest experience and feedback regarding the same.\n\nBack then, I was going through alot in the little life i had lived. Every day was filled with me being angry over petty issues and rounds of insomnia taking over my life. I was at the lowest point in my personal life and i had nothing to hold onto. I had alot of people around me who loved me yet at the end of the night when i was trying to sleep, something didnt feel alright. I felt incomplete.\n\nThat was when I started delving into the world of spirituality. I started doing meditation, the free youtube vides of Guided meditation. It was fine experience. But nothing groundbreaking.\n\nI stumbled across this Sadhguru video and after some research decided to partake Inner Engineering.\n\nAnd hands down, that was the best decision i'd ever taken. Inner Engineering made me connect to myself. It made me realize what was at the center of universe. I started becoming calmer, my anxiety reduced by alot. And my health improved too. I became fitter and felt lively. Inner Engineering is not to answer your questions, it is to help you understand that the answers to the questions that you seek are just nothing, you realise your questions are meaningless.\n\nI would recommend you all to try this too. Theres no harm in trying a new experience right? \n\nAnd believe me, it will change your life!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bmcihm/my_experience_with_inner_engineering/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Big Blunder by Russia: Sinks Its Own Vessel During Baltic Naval Exercises", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dagens.com/news/big-blunder-by-russia-sinks-its-own-vessel-during-baltic-naval-exercises", "author": "None"}, {"title": "50% discount on IE for youth!!", "summary": "50% off on Inner Engineering for folks 25 or less in age!!

It's about a platform named sCompute, which seems to be pushing the boundaries of how we build ML models by focusing on the quality of data.\n\nThe premise is that no matter how sophisticated our algorithms are, the models are only as good as the data they're trained on. sCompute addresses this by providing a streamlined pipeline for ensuring data quality before it's ever fed into a machine learning model.\n\nKey takeaways from the article:\n\n* **Data Quality**: sCompute emphasizes the importance of high-quality data, which is often overlooked in the rush to produce machine learning models.\n* **Streamlined Processes**: The platform offers tools for data cleaning, validation, and augmentation, which are critical for building robust ML models.\n* **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**: By automating and optimizing many of the preliminary stages of ML model development, sCompute claims to save both time and resources.\n* **Adaptability**: It caters to various fields, including NLP and computer vision, making it a versatile tool for many of us in the language technology domain.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on the importance of data quality in our field and how platforms like sCompute could influence the future of ML model development.\n\nHere's the article for those interested in a deep dive: [Build ML Models on the Highest Quality Data -
