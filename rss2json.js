Does this video expand on or contradict their usual perspective?\n\nAnalyze this video: [PASTE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK HERE]\n\n# Option B: The Gemini \"Strategic Analyst\" Prompt\n\n**Best for:**\u00a0Fluent, structured analysis that leverages Google's native YouTube integration for a deep dive into the video itself.\n\n**The 60-Second Method:**\n\n1. Go to\u00a0**gemini.google.com**.\n2. Go to\u00a0**Settings**\u00a0\\&gt;\u00a0**Extensions**\u00a0and ensure the\u00a0**YouTube**\u00a0extension is enabled.\n3. Copy the YouTube video URL.\n4. Paste the following prompt and your link.\n\n**Gemini Super-Prompt**\n\nAct as a world-class strategic analyst using your native YouTube extension. Your analysis should be deep, insightful, and structured for clarity.\n\nFor the video linked below, please provide the following:\n\n1. **The Core Thesis:** In a single, concise sentence, what is the absolute central argument of this video?\u00a0  \n2. **Key Pillars of Argument:** Present the 3-5 main arguments that support the core thesis.\u00a0  \n3. **The Hook Deconstructed:** Quote the hook from the first 30 seconds and explain the psychological trigger it uses (e.g., \"Creates an information gap,\" \"Challenges a common belief\").\u00a0  \n4. **Most Tweetable Moment:** Identify the single most powerful, shareable quote from the video and present it as a blockquote.  \n5. **Audience &amp; Purpose:** Describe the target audience and the primary goal the creator likely had (e.g., \"Educate beginners,\" \"Build brand affinity\").\n\nAnalyze this video: [PASTE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK HERE]\n\n  \nThe Gemini prompt is my favorite for analyzing videos in 60 seconds and really pulling out the key points.  Saves so many hours I don't have to watch videos where people often have a few good points but go on and on about a lot of nothing.\n\nI then built an app with Lovable, Supabase and the Gemini API and started analyzing entire YT channels to understand the best videos, what content gets the most views and likes, and I also studied the viral hooks people use in the first 30 seconds of a video that makes or breaks the video engagement.\n\nI was really able to learn quite a lot really fast.  From studying 100 channels about AI I learned that the CEO of NVIDIA's keynote in March 2025 was the most watched AI video in YouTub with 37 million views.  \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m7kzi6/i_used_these_perplexity_and_gemini_prompts_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World's first IVF rhino pregnancy 'could save species'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68064432", "author": "None"}, {"title": "On July 27, 1981, six-year-old Adam Walsh was kidnapped from a Sears in Hollywood, Florida.

You get prompt versioning, testing, A/B comparisons, and evaluation tools (human + automated) in one place. It\u2019s designed with evals in mind, which helps when you're trying to ship production-grade prompts.\n* **Vellum** \u2013 Great for teams working with non-technical stakeholders. Has a nice UI for managing prompt templates, and decent test case coverage. Feels more like a CMS for prompts.\n* **PromptLayer** \u2013 Primarily for logging and monitoring. If you just want to track what prompts were sent and what responses came back, this does the job.\n* **LangSmith** \u2013 Deep integration with LangChain, strong on traces and debugging. If you\u2019re building complex chains and want granular visibility, this fits well. But less intuitive if you're not using LangChain.\n* **Promptable** \u2013 Lightweight and flexible, good for hacking on small projects. Doesn\u2019t have built-in evaluations or testing, but it\u2019s clean and dev-friendly.\n\nAlso: I ended up picking Maxim for my current setup mainly because I needed to test prompt changes against real-world cases and get structured feedback. It\u2019s not just storage, it actually helps you figure out what\u2019s *better*.\n\nWould love to hear what workflows/tools you\u2019re using.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m83bfz/what_are_people_using_for_prompt_management_these/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - Abhisheksinha1506/alienwar: AlienWar is a simple survival game built with p5.js.

Not because the model *knows*\u2014but because it\u2019s optimized to perform patterns humans reward.\n\nIt covers concepts like hyperactive agency detection (HAD), projection bias, and our evolutionary tendency to infer mind from minimal cues.
