And they come despite the current government pledging to accelerate Poland\u2019s green transition after taking power from its conservative predecessor two years ago.\n\nHowever, the new data, which come from the Fraunhofer Society, a German research organisation, do show that the share of coal in Poland\u2019s power mix fell from 56.6% in 2024 to 52.2% in 2025.\n\nThe Fraunhofer Society\u2019s figures show that 29.4% of Poland\u2019s electricity came from renewable sources last year, which was only marginally higher than the 29.0% recorded in 2024 (an updated figure from the\u00a0[28.8% originally reported]( Onshore wind (14.2%) led the way, followed by solar (12.1%) and biomass (1.8%)\n\nMeanwhile, hard coal accounted for 32.9% of the energy mix and brown coal for 19.3%, making up 52.2% in total, which is by far the highest figure in the European Union.\n\nThe fall in coal\u2019s share was covered in large part by a rise in gas-fired generation, which increased to 13.2% of the mix from 10.6% in 2024. Poland\u2019s gas market has been booming this year, with a\u00a0[record annual volume of gas](\u00a0already traded on the Polish Power Exchange by\u00a0November.\n\nPoland remains the EU\u2019s most\u00a0[coal-dependent country](\u00a0and the only member state without a coal phase-out date. However, it has stepped up efforts to curb fossil fuel use following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis.\n\nThe share of renewables in Poland\u2019s energy mix has nearly doubled since 2021, when the figure stood at 14.7%. However, most of the increase came between 2021 and 2023, when the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party was in power.\n\nIn 2023, the PiS government\u00a0[outlined plans](\u00a0for 51% of electricity to come from\u00a0renewables and 23% from nuclear by 2040.\n\nA more liberal coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office at the end of that year, pledging in its coalition agreement to \u201caccelerate the energy transition\u201d and \u201cincrease the share of renewable energy sources in electricity production\u201d. But it has so far\u00a0[made limited progress](\n\nThe ruling coalition did last year pass a bill intended to ease PiS-era restrictions on building new onshore wind turbines. But the legislation was\u00a0[vetoed](\u00a0by PiS-aligned President Karol Nawrocki.\n\nThe current government has, meanwhile, continued with plans put in place under PiS to establish Poland\u2019s first[\u00a0offshore wind farms]( the first of which is due to go into operation this year.\n\nThe Tusk administration has also pressed ahead with PiS\u2019s plans to build\u00a0[Poland\u2019s first nuclear power plants]( with the first due to be completed by 2036.\n\nBut the government has failed to deliver a key plan to the EU outlining how it intends to reduce emissions. The document was due to be submitted to Brussels by the end of June 2024 and Poland is now the only member state that has not done so, prompting the European Commission to\u00a0[launch legal action](\u00a0in October.\n\nThe energy ministry presented an updated draft plan late last month, but it still requires government approval before being formally submitted to the EU.\n\nThe draft envisages renewables accounting for 65.6-68.9% of Poland\u2019s energy mix by 2040, with nuclear providing a further 15.3-16.3% and coal between 0 and 4.8%.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/02/share-of-renewables-in-polands-energy-mix-stagnant-in-2025-with-coal-still-dominant/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lammy: My Christian faith shows me it\u2019s right to curb jury trials", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/04/lammy-my-christian-faith-shows-me-right-curb-jury-trials/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel, Syria agree on mechanism to communicate, share intel, seek commercial opportunities", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-syria-agree-on-mechanism-to-communicate-share-intel-seek-commercial-opportunities/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland introduces biggest changes to spelling in almost a century", "summary": "", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/02/poland-introduces-biggest-changes-to-spelling-in-almost-a-century/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
