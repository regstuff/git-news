The group\u2019s officials say Israel has provided no proof for its claims of sweeping misconduct by its employees.\n\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war began, UNRWA played a key role in distributing food, medicine and other aid to Palestinians during the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The agency\u2019s schools were converted into shelters hosting displaced Palestinians.\n\nThat changed after last year\u2019s ban, which severely hobbled the U.N. agency\u2019s efforts in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel stopped providing new visas for UNRWA staff members to travel to Israel and Gaza; as a result, its East Jerusalem offices are now largely vacant.\n\nIsrael accuses Hamas, which seized full control of Gaza in 2007, of extensively infiltrating UNRWA. The Israeli military has said more than 10 percent of the group\u2019s employees are members of Hamas and other armed groups, without providing evidence.\n\nAn UNRWA spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFounded in 1949, UNRWA serves Palestinians displaced by the wars surrounding the founding of Israel, as well as their descendants. More than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were forced from their homes in what became Israel, and the agency grants refugee status to them and their descendants, who now number about six million.\n\nIsraeli officials have bristled at both the existence of a special agency for Palestinians and allowing their children and grandchildren to also claim the status of refugees. They have long argued that UNRWA perpetuates the conflict by tacitly encouraging Palestinians to seek a right of return to Israel.\n\nUNRWA\u2019s role was particularly pronounced in Gaza, where the agency said it had registered more than 1.5 million people as refugees. Its schools and health clinics \u2014 as well as the salaries paid to its employees \u2014 provided a modicum of stability in the impoverished enclave.\n\nSince Israel began leveling its accusations, the agency has denied that it has been compromised, saying that it even regularly shared its employee rosters with Israel.\n\nIsraeli officials also accused at least 19 UNRWA employees of participating in the 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel. A subsequent U.N. inquiry found that at least nine employees may have participated in the assault, leading to their dismissal. The organization employs about 12,000 people in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn October, the International Court of Justice ordered the Israeli government not to interfere with UNRWA\u2019s work in the West Bank and Gaza. The court told Israel to \u201cagree to and facilitate\u201d attempts to provide aid there \u201cby all means at its disposal\u201d \u2014 including UNRWA.\n\n[\n\nEdit: restoring missing text from article not in the archive link", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-diplomatic-immunity.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nvidia insists it isn\u2019t Enron, but its AI deals are testing investor faith | Nvidia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/28/nvidia-insists-it-isnt-enron-but-its-ai-deals-are-testing-investor-faith", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Saudi Arabia bombs Yemen port over weapons shipment from UAE, issues warning to Abu Dhabi", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-bomb-yemen-mukalla-weapons-uae-9fc56e4678a12f56d61b1ecf855d4a4e", "author": "None"}, {"title": "No, Vladimir Putin Does Not Want to See Ukraine \u2018Succeed\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/no-vladimir-putin-does-not-want-to-see-ukraine-succeed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine denies drone attack on Putin\u2019s residence", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g4g5lgngvo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "African Union Rejects Recognition Of Somaliland, Reaffirms Support For Somalia\u2019s Unity", "summary": "", "link": "https://saharareporters.com/2025/12/27/african-union-rejects-recognition-somaliland-reaffirms-support-somalias-unity", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland signs deal to produce South Korean missiles domestically", "summary": "Poland, in cooperation with South Korean partners, will for the first time produce guided missiles domestically under a deal worth more than 14 billion zloty (\u20ac3.3 billion).\n\nUnder the agreement, signed between the state treasury and a consortium made up of Poland\u2019s WB Electronics and South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Aerospace, Poland will manufacture more than 10,000 CGR-080 precision-guided missiles.\n\nThey are used by the K239 Chunmoo rocket artillery systems, hundreds of which Poland has purchased from South Korea, with their Polish variant known as Homar-K.

Originating from Mali and Niger with roots in jihad and self-defence, Lakurawa has evolved into a hybrid cross-border group blending jihadism and organised crime. Exploiting weak governance, poverty and insecurity, it uses religion to justify predation, including cattle rustling, crop seizures and oil sabotage. Its recent interactions with a Boko Haram faction heighten the threat.
