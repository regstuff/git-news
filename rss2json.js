Every rescue made the project more useful, and the stars followed naturally.\n\n---\n\n### Why I\u2019m sharing this here\n\nThis repo is the reason I broke through the cold start. It\u2019s MIT, text-only, and free to copy or remix. Inside you\u2019ll also see TXTOS, a plain-text OS I built to boost memory and stability when running LLMs \u2014 it\u2019s been another piece people found surprisingly useful.\n\nI thought some of you might find it cool (or helpful) to see how focusing on pain point mapping can drive growth for an open source project.\n\nWould love any feedback \u2014 or if you\u2019ve run into recurring bugs in your own pipelines, I can fold them into the map so the next dev doesn\u2019t hit the same wall.\n\nThanks for reading,\nPS BigBig", "link": "https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md", "author": "None"}, {"title": "52% of Germans say Ukraine should cede Russian-occupied territories for peace, poll shows", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/52-of-germans-say-ukraine-should-cede-occupied-territories-for-peace-poll-shows/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel\u2019s Netanyahu recognises Armenian Genocide in a historic first | Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recognised the genocides carried out by the Ottoman Empire against Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians, in a first for the country", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/2025/08/27/israels-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-recognises-armenian-genocide-for-first-time", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indonesia: Jakarta protests resume after overnight clash kills motorcycle taxi driver", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cdrk7rjv8z5t", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India \u2018needs to defend its interests\u2019, no pressure from Kyiv over Russian oil purchase\u2014Ukraine envoy", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/diplomacy/india-needs-to-defend-its-interests-no-pressure-from-kyiv-over-russian-oil-purchase-ukraine-envoy/2728159/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan evacuates a million people as farming belt hit by worst floods in decades", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/pakistan-evacuates-million-people-farming-belt-hit-by-worst-floods-decades-2025-08-28/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
