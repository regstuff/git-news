Formerly known as KORWiN, after its founder Janusz Korwin-Mikke, it is part of the broader far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) alliance that has 16 seats in Poland\u2019s parliament.\n\nHowever, in November last year, Warsaw\u2019s district court ordered that New Hope be removed from the register of political parties at the request of the National Electoral Commission (PKW) as a punishment for failing to submit its 2024 financial report on time.\n\nBecause New Hope launched an appeal, the ruling has not yet been implemented. However, with the party pessimistic about its chances of success, it has launched a contingency plan.\n\nIn January, Confederation spokesman and close Mentzen associate Wojciech Machulski registered a new political party called Empire Strikes Back (Imperium Kontratakuje).\n\nNow, at a behind-closed-doors congress on Saturday, the two parties merged, with New Hope\u2019s structures and assets incorporated into Empire Strikes Back. The next step will be that Empire Strikes Back formally changes its name to New Hope, thereby creating a \u201cnew\u201d party identical to the old one.\n\nThat manoeuvre will \u201cgive us freedom to operate, a formal leeway that makes the dispute with the National Electoral Commission irrelevant for us, and allows us to continue functioning as New Hope\u201d, the party\u2019s deputy leader, Bart\u0142omiej Pejo, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nMentzen, meanwhile, says that the fact his party was both forced to and was able to carry out such a move shows that Poland\u2019s rules around political parties are \u201ca complete joke\u201d. He noted that when companies miss deadlines to file financial reports, they are not deregistered.\n\nWhen Confederation was formed in 2018, it was an alliance of three main groups: the libertarian KORWiN/New Hope; the nationalist National Movement (Ruch Narodowy), led by Krzysztof Bosak; and a group of radical-right monarchists led by\u00a0[Grzegorz Braun](\n\nThey together won 7% of the vote in the 2023 parliamentary elections, finishing fifth. Last year, however, Braun and his Confederation of the Polish Crown (KPP) were expelled from the broader Confederation group after he announced a rival presidential to official candidate Mentzen.\n\nAt May\u2019s\u00a0[election first round]( Mentzen, whose campaign was characterised by beer-fuelled rallies and a savvy social media campaign. finished third with 14.8% of the vote, followed by Braun on 6.3%.\n\nBoth Confederation and KPP continue to enjoy strong support in polls, at around 13% and 8% respectively, according to averages compiled by the eWybory website.\n\n[**Daniel Tilles**](\n\nDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0*Notes from Poland*.

NATO deputy secretary general Radmila \u0160ekerinska and the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, also attended.\n\nIn a joint statement, the quintet said they had agreed to launch the Low-Cost Effectors and Autonomous Platforms (LEAP) initiative. Effectors are weapons systems mounted on equipment such as drones, while autonomous platforms are the actual unmanned aerial vehicles themselves.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, we aim to prevent potential aggression by Russia and ensure the capacity to respond to a broad range of threats,\u201d said the group.\n\n\u201cAlongside cooperation on traditional weapons systems, this will improve our collective security within the alliance, help fulfil NATO capability requirements, and strengthen European cooperation with a view to greater burden-sharing among allies.\u201d\n\nThe initiative is partly a response to growing incidents of air incursions and airspace violations by Russia and Belarus against NATO countries.\n\nIn September, Poland and its NATO allies\u00a0[shot down](\u00a0a number of Russian military drones that entered Polish airspace in what authorities called an \u201cunprecedented violation\u201d.\n\nThat response was initially heralded as a successful show of NATO\u2019s resolve, but it quickly became clear that Poland and other countries on the eastern front\u00a0[lacked]( adequate anti-drone defence capabilities.\n\nExpensive jets and their expensive missiles, costing over a million euros a piece, were used to destroy cheap Russian weapons. Only three out of 21 drones were neutralised, while Ukraine, by comparison, normally takes down over 90% of Russian swarms.\n\n\u201cTechnologies and combat techniques are changing rapidly \u2013 we must react quickly and appropriately,\u201d said Polish defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that we are matching the cost of the threats with the cost of defence,\u201d commented the UK\u2019s minister of state for defence readiness and industry, Luke Pollard, quoted by\u00a0*Politico Europe*.\n\nThe UK government said in a separate statement that the first project under the LEAP initiative will be delivered by 2027. Pollard referred to the initiative as a \u201cmulti-million pound, multi-million euro commitment\u201d, reports Reuters.\n\nThe E5 defence ministers also reiterated their commitment to boosting respective defence spending to 5% of GDP as agreed by NATO. Poland is already close to hitting that target, with its defence budget set to reach 4.8% of GDP this year, the\u00a0[largest relative]( figure in NATO.\n\nLast month, Poland\u00a0[signed an agreement](\u00a0with Norwegian partners to develop a new anti-drone system called SAN, which Warsaw claims will be the first of its kind in Europe and is intended to protect the country\u2019s eastern borders.\n\nPart of the funding for SAN comes from the EU\u2019s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) programme, which is\u00a0[providing almost \u20ac44 billion](\u00a0(185 billion zloty) in loans for Poland to support its defence spending.\n\nIn their statement on Friday, the E5 defence ministers \u201cwelcomed the EU\u2019s commitment to providing member states with increased fiscal flexibility for defence spending and to create lending instruments\u201d.\n\nHowever, the SAFE programme have been mired in domestic political controversy in Poland, where the right-wing opposition has urged conservative President Karol Nawrocki to try to block the funds, arguing they will place Warsaw under stronger influence from Brussels and potentially anger Washington.\n\n[**Olivier Sorgho**](\n\nOlivier Sorgho is senior editor at Notes from Poland, covering politics, business and society.
