My goal is twofold: To dynamically find groups of related words so that puzzles can have some semblance of a theme, and to learn about language processing techniques because\u2026well\u2026I like learning things. The fact that learning aligns with my first goal is just an awesome bonus.\n\nA quick bit about the dataset:\n\n* As I said above, it\u2019s comprised of individual words. This has made things\u2026difficult.\n* Words are *mostly* in English. Eventually I\u2019d like to deliberately expand to other languages.\n* All words are exactly five letters\n* Some words are obscure, archaic, and possibly made up\n* No preprocessing has been done at all.

I was able to see some clusters using a combination of a pre-trained GloVe embedding and DBSAN, but the clusters are *very* small. For example, I can see a cluster of words related to Basketball (dunks, fouls, layup, treys) and American Football (punts, sacks, yards), but cant figure out how to get a broader sports related cluster. Most clusters end up being &lt;= 6 words, and I usually end up with 1 giant cluster and lots of noise.\n\nI\u2019d love to feed the list into a magical unicorn algorithm that could spit out groups like \u201cfood\u201d, \u201ctechnology\u201d, \u201cthings that are green\u201d, or \u201cwords that rhyme\u201d in one shot, but I realize that\u2019s unrealistic. Like I said, this about learning too.\n\nWhat tools, libraries, models, algorithms, dark magic can I explore to help me find dynamically generated groups/topics/themes in my word list?

Etc the more the better)\n Comprehensive Public OSINT Collection for Individual Profile\n\nYour task is to gather the most extensive publicly available information on a target individual using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques as outlined in the provided sources. Restrict your search strictly to publicly available information (PAI) and the methods described for OSINT collection. The goal is to build a detailed profile based solely on data that is open and accessible through the techniques mentioned.\n\nSteps for Public OSINT Collection on an Individual:\n\n1. \n\nDefine Objectives and Scope:\n\nClearly state the specific information you aim to find about the person (e.g., contact details, social media presence, professional history, personal interests, connections).\n\nDefine the purpose of this information gathering (e.g., background check, security assessment context). Ensure this purpose aligns with ethical and legal boundaries for OSINT collection.\n\nExplicitly limit the scope to publicly available information (PAI) only. Be mindful of ethical boundaries when collecting information, particularly from social media, ensuring only public data is accessed and used.\n\n\n2. \n\nInitial Information Gathering (Seed Information):\n\nBegin by listing all known information about the target individual (e.g., full name, known usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, date of birth, place of employment).\n\nDocument all knowns and initial findings in a centralized, organized location, such as a digital document, notebook, or specialized tool like Basket or Dradis, for easy recall and utilization.\n\n\n3. \n\nComprehensive Public OSINT Collection Techniques:\n\nFocus on collecting Publicly Available Information (PAI), which can be found on the surface, deep, and dark webs, ensuring collection methods are OSINT-based. Note that OSINT specifically covers public social media.\n\nUtilize Search Engines: Employ both general search engines (like Google) and explore specialized search tools. Use advanced search operators to refine results.\n\nEmploy People Search Tools: Use dedicated people search engines such as Full Contact, Spokeo, and Intelius. Recognize that some background checkers may offer detailed information, but strictly adhere to collecting only publicly available details from these sources.\n\nExplore Social Media Platforms: Search popular platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) for public profiles and publicly shared posts. Information gathered might include addresses, job details, pictures, hobbies. LinkedIn is a valuable source for professional information, revealing technologies used at companies and potential roles. Always respect ethical boundaries and focus only on publicly accessible content.\n\nConduct Username Searches: Use tools designed to identify if a username is used across multiple platforms (e.g., WhatsMyName, Userrecon, Sherlock).\n\nPerform Email Address Research: If an email address is known, use tools to find associated public information such as usernames, photos, or linked social media accounts. Check if the email address appears in publicly disclosed data breaches using services like Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). Analyze company email addresses found publicly to deduce email syntax.\n\nSearch Public Records: Access public databases to find information like addresses or legal records.\n\nExamine Job Boards and Career Sites: Look for publicly posted resumes, CVs, or employment history on sites like Indeed and LinkedIn. These sources can also reveal technologies used by organizations.\n\nUtilize Image Search: Use reverse image search tools to find other instances of a specific image online or to identify a person from a picture.\n\nSearch for Public Documents: Look for documents, presentations, or publications publicly available online that mention the target's name or other identifiers. Use tools to extract metadata from these documents (author, creation/modification dates, software used), which can sometimes reveal usernames, operating systems, and software.\n\nCheck Q&amp;A Sites, Forums, and Blogs: Search these platforms for posts or comments made by the target individual.\n\nIdentify Experts: Look for individuals recognized as experts in specific fields on relevant platforms.\n\nGather Specific Personal Details (for potential analysis, e.g., password strength testing): Collect publicly available information such as names of spouse, siblings, parents, children, pets, favorite words, and numbers. Note: The use of this information in tools like Pwdlogy is mentioned in the sources for analysis within a specific context (e.g., ethical hacking), but the collection itself relies on OSINT.\n\nLook for Mentions in News and Grey Literature: Explore news articles, press releases, and grey literature (reports, working papers not controlled by commercial publishers) for mentions of the individual.\n\nInvestigate Public Company Information: If the individual is linked to a company, explore public company profiles (e.g., Crunchbase), public records like WHOIS for domains, and DNS records. Tools like Shodan can provide information about internet-connected systems linked to a domain that might provide context about individuals working there.\n\nAnalyze Publicly Discarded Information: While potentially involving physical collection, note the types of information that might be found in publicly accessible trash (e.g., discarded documents, invoices). This highlights the nature of information sometimes available through non-digital public means.\n\nEmploy Visualization Tools: Use tools like Maltego to gather and visualize connections and information related to the target.\n\nMaintain Operational Security: Utilize virtual machines (VMs) or a cloud VPS to compartmentalize your collection activities. Consider using Managed Attribution (MA) techniques to obfuscate your identity and methods when collecting PAI.\n\n\n4. \n\nAnalysis and Synthesis:\n\nAnalyze the gathered public data to build a comprehensive profile of the individual.\n\nOrganize and catalog the information logically for easy access and understanding. Think critically about the data to identify relevant insights and potential connections.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kf2lty/how_i_use_notebook_lm_gpt4_as_a_personal_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ChatForge is a Django-based desktop-style chat application that integrates with multiple AI backends (via OpenRouter)", "summary": "I\u2019ve been working on\u00a0**ChatForge**\u2014a no-BS, open-source chat client that lets you access\u00a0**318+ AI models**\u00a0(GPT-4.1 Mini, Claude 3.7, Qwen, Gemini, etc.) from one dashboard.
