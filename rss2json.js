QUANTUM PHYSICS  \nInitial state: |\u03c8\u27e9 = (3|0\u27e9 + 4i|1\u27e9)/5  \n\u2192 The probability of getting |1\u27e9 is |4i/5|\u00b2 = (16/25) = **64%**  \n\u2192 After the measurement, the system collapses into the state **|1\u27e9**\n\n2. NUMBER THEORY  \nSuppose there exist positive integers x, y, z such that x\u2074 + y\u2074 = z\u2074.  \n\u2192 Then (x\u00b2)\u00b2 + (y\u00b2)\u00b2 = (z\u00b2)\u00b2  \n\u2192 It is a sum of two squares that gives a perfect square.  \nBut Fermat proved that **x\u2074 + y\u2074 \u2260 z\u2074** has no positive integer solutions,  \nusing **infinite descent**: each solution would produce a smaller one, leading to contradiction.  \n\u2192 **Conclusion**: **No positive integer solution exists.**\n\n3. ANALYTICAL PHILOSOPHY  \nGettier shows that the triple **JTB (Justified True Belief)** is not sufficient for knowledge,  \nbecause one can have a true and justified belief **for wrong or accidental reasons**.  \n\u2192 In this case, Smith has a true belief due to a **coincidence**.  \n\u2192 Proposed solution: Add a condition like **\u201cno essential falsehood in the justification\u201d**  \nor a notion of **\u201ccausal traceability\u201d or \u201creliabilism\u201d**.  \n\n4. MOLECULAR BIOCHEMISTRY  \nThe enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is **aldolase**.  \n\u2192 Produces: **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)** and **dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)**.  \n\u2192 Only G3P enters glycolysis directly; DHAP is converted to G3P \u200b\u200bvia **triose phosphate isomerase**  \nbecause **only G3P is the substrate of the next step of glycolysis.**\n\n5. THEORY OF COMPUTATION  \nSuppose HALT(M, w) is decidable (i.e. there exists H which tells whether M stops on input w).  \n\u2192 I build a machine D that does: \u201cif H(M, M) says that M stops on itself, then it enters a loop;  \notherwise, it stops.\u201d  \n\u2192 Now we execute D(D):  \n\u2192 If D(D) stops \u2192 then H said that D(D) does not stop \u2192 Contradiction  \n\u2192 If D(D) does not stop \u2192 then H said that D(D) stops \u2192 Contradiction  \n\u2192 **Conclusion**: HALT cannot be decidable \u2192 **Undecidability demonstrated via diagonalization.**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1op7an0/deductive_behavior_in_statistical_models/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Has anyone gotten a \u201cknowledge-enabled\u201d default agent working in Open WebUI?", "summary": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to get a default agent in Open WebUI that can access organizational or contextual knowledge when needed, but not constantly.\n\nBasically, I want the main assistant (the default agent) to handle general chat as usual, but to be able to reference stored knowledge or a connected knowledge base on demand \u2014 like when the user asks something that requires internal data or documentation.\n\nHas anyone managed to get something like that working natively in Open WebUI (maybe using the Knowledge feature or RAG settings)?\n\nIf not, I\u2019m thinking about building an external bridge \u2014 for example, using n8n as a tool that holds or queries the knowledge, and letting the Open WebUI agent decide when to call it or not.\n\nWould love to hear how others are handling this \u2014 any setups, examples, or best practices?\n\nThanks!\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1opbd4u/has_anyone_gotten_a_knowledgeenabled_default/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Before the Hittites: 8,000-Year-Old Rock Art Discovered in Central Anatolia | Ancientist", "summary": "", "link": "https://ancientist.com/before-the-hittites-8000-year-old-rock-art-discovered-in-central-anatolia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Swedish Diplomat Who Defied Death to Save 100,000 Jews", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/history/@arraymedia/the-swedish-diplomat-who-defied-death-to-save-100000-jews", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018People think Wi-Fi is a premium:\u2019 Inuit youth brings free internet to Arctic community", "summary": "", "link": "https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/people-think-wi-fi-is-a-premium-inuit-youth-brings-free-internet-to-arctic-community/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dillo, a multi-platform graphical web browser", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/dillo-browser/dillo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pokrovsk days numbered amid Russian assault, experts urge retreat", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/06/ukraine-pokrovsk-fall-russia-war/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Man gropes Mexican president as she speaks to citizens on the streets", "summary": "###Man tries to kiss and embrace Claudia Sheinbaum, highlighting security risk and harassment women face in Mexico\n\nThe Mexican president, [Claudia Sheinbaum]( has been groped by a man as she mingled with citizens on the streets of Mexico City, raising questions about the lack of presidential security and the level of sexual harassment the country\u2019s women face.\n\nA video of the incident on Tuesday shows a visibly drunk man trying to kiss the president on the neck and embrace her from behind, as she removes his hands and turns to face him, before a government official steps in and places himself between them.\n\nAs the man is steered away, Sheinbaum can be seen smiling stiffly and saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nState police later [confirmed]( that the man had been arrested, and Sheinbaum said on Wednesday she would press charges.\n\n\u201cThis is something I experienced as a woman, but it is something that all women in our country experience,\u201d said Sheinbaum in her daily press conference. \u201cIf I do not file a complaint, where does that leave all Mexican women?
