The system originally reserved 30% of these opportunities for freedom fighters but was later extended to include the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters, a group that constitutes only about 0.13% of the population. This discrepancy sparked widespread outrage among students, who argued that the quota system was inequitable.\n\nThe intensity of the protests led the government to abolish the quota system in 2018. However, in a controversial turn of events, the High Court of Bangladesh ruled in 2024 that the government's decision to remove the quota system was unconstitutional, thus reinstating it.\n\n**The Political Underpinnings of Sheikh Hasina's Stance**\n\nSheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, implicitly supported the reservation system. This support was partly driven by political considerations, as the beneficiaries of the quota system were likely to be loyal to her and her family. Sheikh Hasina hails from the family of Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh and a prominent freedom fighter. By ensuring that a significant portion of government positions were held by descendants of freedom fighters, she could secure a government filled with allies.\n\nOn the surface, this might appear as an unfair manipulation of the system. However, the context reveals a more complex rationale. Sheikh Hasina\u2019s entire family was tragically murdered by the extremist group Jamaat-e-Islami, which wields significant influence in Islamic countries, including Bangladesh. There was a legitimate concern that if members of Jamaat-e-Islami occupied even 20% of government seats, they could potentially orchestrate a coup to overthrow her moderate liberal administration and also murder her.\n\nCritics, particularly from left-leaning platforms, will highlight Sheikh Hasina's apparent unfairness in maintaining the quota system but don't discuss the reasons for her support to the reservation system. Her approach was, in part, a defensive measure to prevent extremist elements from gaining power and endangering her government and personal safety, which is exactly what happened.\n\n**The Military Coup and International Dynamics**\n\nTowards the end of this political saga, the military took advantage of the chaotic situation. The military commander, allegedly paid off by the CIA, refused to take orders from Sheikh Hasina, forcing her to flee the country. This move aligns closely with the CIA's historical playbook, which has often involved destabilizing governments deemed unfavorable to U.S. interests.\n\nWhat intensified the intrigue was the subsequent refusal of the UK and the US to grant political asylum to Sheikh Hasina. These countries, known for offering asylum to various criminal figures\u2014including the Shah of Iran after the Iranian Revolution despite his brutal crackdown on Iranians\u2014denied her refuge. This refusal highlighted a stark contradiction in the asylum policies of these nations, sparking further debate on international political motives and alliances. Anyone who thinks this was a pro-democracy student led protest has their head up their a\\*\\*.\n\n**Lessons for India**\n\nThe events in Bangladesh offer several critical lessons for India, particularly concerning its relationship with the United States:\n\n1. **Reevaluating Ties with the US**: I have been saying this for a long time and will say it again, The US is the worst s\\*um on eath country to exist. We need to normalize ties with china ASAP. Go through my comment history and you'll see I have pushed for this.\n2. **US Pressure Tactics**: The primary reason for the US to support a more extremist government in Bangladesh is to exert pressure on India. As one of the few sovereign states refusing to toe the US line, India faces a threat. By surrounding India with hostile regimes, the US aims to coerce India into compliance. If India continues to resist, the US will fund terror organizations in India's Northeast, much like how Israel faces threats in its region.\n3. **Economic Control**: The US seeks to dominate Indian markets, allowing American companies to run amok and creating a capitalist sh\\*t hole like in the US. Additionally, the US wants to ensure India distances itself from Russia and aligns more closely with Western economic and political interests.\n4. **Geopolitical Manipulation**: Another significant reason behind US policy is the desire to see India engage in conflict with China. The US, anticipating an inevitable confrontation with China, prefers India to serve as the frontline, thereby weakening China before a direct US engagement. This manipulation positions India as cannon fodder in the broader geopolitical struggle.\n5. **Control of Information**: They want to control the indian mind. You might think Ig, FB, Twitter etc are beacons of American free speech but all they are are tools for the US govt to control the narrative in India and control the mind of Indians. Recent example being stand with reasi was pulled down by Ig but stand with Rafah was promoted. They want a certain ideology to prevail. I FULLY suport the banning of such platforms in india. We need a China like ecosystem with indigenously developed social media sites controlled within india and closed off from the rest of the world.\n\nDisclosure: ChatGPT was utilized to **rephrase** parts of this article for clarity.\n\nEDIT: I dont understand how some of y'all think normalizing ties with China is anything beyond just normal trade and investment related relations. No, dont cozy up with China. Dont consider them saviours. What I am saying is open it up for both of them so we can essentially use one as leverage over the other. Right now we have no leverage with the US, and thats exactly why they can pull off such antics in out neighborhood with no repercussions.
