Until now, the cost of creating a new foundation model has been cost-prohibitive so my team has focused on tightening up our training and text annotation methodologies to squeeze performance out of existing open source models.\n\nMy company leaders have asked me to strongly consider creating a foundation model that we can push even further than the best off-the-shelf models. It's a big jump in cost, so I'm writing a summary of the expected risks, rewards, infrastructure, timelines, etc. that we can use as a basis for our conversation.\n\nI'm curious what people here would recommend in terms of today's best practice papers/articles/books/repos or industry success stories to get my feet back on the ground with pre-training the current era of LLMs. Fortunately, I'm not jumping in cold. I have old publications on BERT pre-training where we found unsurprising gains from fundamental changes like domain-specific tokenization. I thought BERT was expensive, but it sure looks easy to burn an entire startup funding round with these larger models.
