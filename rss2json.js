First of all, I want to thank the whole Reddit community for all the knowledge I gained - and, of course, the entertainment! :)\n\nI have a weird issue with native function/tool calling in Open WebUI. I can't imagine it's a general issue, so maybe you can guide me on the right track and tell me what I'm doing wrong.\n\nMy issue: (how I found it)  \nWhen I let the model call a tool using native function calling, the messages the tool emits are not shown in the conversation. Instead, I get the request/response sequence from the LLM &lt;-&gt; tool conversation in the \"Tool Result\" dialog. In my case, I used the \"[imaGE(Gen &amp; Edit)]( tool, which emits the generated image to the conversation.  \nFor my tests, I replaced the actual API call with an \"emit message\" to save costs while testing. ;)\n\nWhen I use standard function calling, the result looks like this:\n\n[standard function calling](\n\n(marked parts are my testing stuff; normally, the image would be emitted instead of \"Image generated with prompt ...\")  \nThat works fine.\n\nBut when I use native function calling, the result looks like this:\n\n[native function calling](\n\nLines 1-3 are the tool calls from the model; line 4 is the answer from the tool to the model (return statement from the tool function). The emitted messages from the tool are missing! The final answer from the model is the expected one, according to the instruction by the tool response.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\nAs I can see, this affects all models from the native Open WebUI OpenAI connection (which are able to do native function calls).  \nI also tried Grok (also via the native OpenAI connection), which returns thinking statements. There, I see the same issue with the tool above, but also an additional issue (which might be connected to this):  \nThe first \"Thinking\" (marked in the pic) never ends. It's spinning forever (here, I used the [GetTime]( tool - this doesn't emit anything).\n\n[native function calling with thinking](\n\nYou see the \"Thinking\" never ends, and again, the \"request\u2013response\" between the model and tool. The final anwer is correct.\n\nI set up a completely fresh 'latest' OWUI (v0.6.18) instance and only installed the tools I used and set up the API connections to test this behavior without any other weird stuff I might have broken on my main instance :)\n\nHas anyone else observed this issue? I'm looking forward to your insights and any helpful discussion! :)\n\nThank you all!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1mi6m9p/issue_with_native_function_tool_calling/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can you use Postgres as a back-end DB AND a vector DB?", "summary": "Greetings,\n\nWe have a PostgreSQL 17.x cluster at my office, and we were thinking about [migrating the back-end DB for OpenWebUI]( (latest version) from SQLite to PSQL.  \n\nBut I've also heard that PSQL can be used as a vector database for documents (or maybe even crawled websites, I'm not sure) using the pgVector extension (which we have in place already).\n\nIs it possible to use PSQL for both?
