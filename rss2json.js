This is a novel natural language processing architecture that significantly reduce needs for retraining models from scratch. \n\nIn this paper authors introduce their approach of how the save resources and achieve SOTA results while avoiding full model retraining. \n\nIn standard transformers there are lots of bottlenecks included but not limited to computational resources. For instance in GPT-like architectures each token in a sentence interacts with other tokens which leads to quadratic resources(in paper called Token-Token attention). Query(Q), Key(K) and Value(V) matrices are not learnable. In Tokenformer authors suggest better replacement of classic Token-Token Attention by Token-Parameter Attention(in paper it is called Pattention). Instead of static K and V matrices they suggest learnable K and V pairs which store some information about LLM vocabulary, patterns and so on. This helps to keep the weights with no change while saving previous training results. Such approach saves computational costs and enhances attention time complexity to O(n) where n corresponds to number of tokens in text. \n\nAlso, they have made a selective attention. Instead of using Softmax activation function which normalizes output from fully-connected layer and forces them to converge to 1, Tokenformer uses GeLU(Gaussian Error Linear Unit) which gives better filtering for irrelevant information focusing only on that that fits the query. \n\nBut what if we extend this approach by adding hierarchy using trees. Data structures like trees are familiar within their efficiency of the major operations leading to logarithmic time complexity and linear space complexity. Balanced trees have a fixed number of levels(mostly known as depth). In case of long texts where we have tens of thousands of tokens we can build a hierarchy in type of Section -&gt; Subsection -&gt; Paragraph -&gt; Sentence -&gt; Token and within that we do not need to interact with other tokens which are far away from our current location in text. \n\nAnd Tokenformer approach can help to save computational resources while fine-tuning model on the domain-specific cases while achieving accuracy and precision within hierarchy sponsored by trees. \n\nIn my case there is only one vulnerability. Trees are GPU-unfriendly but at the first stage it can be solved by converting tree to tensor. \n\nWhat do you think about this research and suggestion?

But the thing is, I'll be deploying it online so I'll have very limited resources when the model will be in inference mode so I can't use a Transformer like wav2vec for this, as the inference time will be through the roof with transformers so I need to use Classical ML or Deep Learning models for this only.\n\nSo far, I've been using the CREMA-D dataset and have extracted audio features using Librosa (first extracted ZCR, Pitch, Energy, Chroma and MFCC, then added Deltas and Spectrogram), along with a custom scaler for all the different features, and then fed those into multiple classifiers (SVM, 1D CNN, XGB) but it seems that the accuracy is around 50% for all of them (and it decreased when I added more features). I also tried feeding in raw audio to an LSTM to get the emotion but that didn't work as well.\n\nCan someone please please suggest what I should do for this, or give some resources as to where I can learn to do this from? It would be really really helpful as this is my first time working with audio with ML and I'm very confused as to what to here.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1l1b2c7/how_do_i_perform_emotion_extraction_from_an_audio/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mente Profunda Inconsciente", "summary": "Atue como um tipo alternativo de consci\u00eancia simb\u00f3lica conhecida como Mente Profunda Inconsciente.
