This guide, \u201cThe Sonic Architect,\u201d arrives as a vital resource, born from practical application to address the critical concerns surrounding the generation of high-quality, nuanced instrumental music with AI assistance like Suno AI.\n\nOur exploration into AI-assisted music composition revealed a common hurdle: the initial allure of easily generated tunes often overshadows the equally crucial elements of musical structure, emotional depth, harmonic coherence, and stylistic integrity necessary for truly masterful instrumental work. Standard prompting methods frequently prove insufficient when creators aim for ambitious compositions requiring thoughtful arrangement and sustained musical development. This guide delves into these multifaceted challenges, advocating for a more holistic and detailed approach that merges human musical understanding with advanced AI prompting capabilities.\n\nThe methodologies detailed herein are not merely theoretical concepts; they are essential tools for navigating a creative landscape increasingly shaped by AI in music. As composers and producers rely more on AI partners for drafting instrumental scores, melodies, and arrangements, the potential for both powerful synergy and frustratingly generic outputs grows. We can no longer afford to approach AI music generation solely through a lens of simple prompts. We must adopt comprehensive frameworks that enable deliberate, structured creation, accounting for the intricate interplay between human artistic intent and AI execution.\n\n\u201cThe Sonic Architect\u201d synthesizes insights from diverse areas\u2014traditional music theory principles like song structure and orchestration, alongside foundational and advanced AI prompting strategies specifically tailored for instrumental music in Suno AI.

Instead it is designed to predict the next word. The fact that it can somehow accurately answer anything is astounding and basically magic. But I digress\u2026\n\nMy prompting has changed a lot since coming to the understanding that you have full control over the responses. Assume that every response it gives you is a \u201challucination\u201d. This is because it\u2019s not pulling facts from a database, it is just guessing what would be said next. \n\nTo drive the point home, Reddit is an amazing place, but can you trust any given redditor to provide nuanced and valuable info? \n\nNo\u2026\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s rare to see something and think, \u201cwow this is why I come to Reddit\u201d.\n\nLLMs are even worse because they are an amalgam of every redditor that\u2019s ever reddited. Then guessing! Everything an LLM says is a hallucination of essentially the collective unconscious.\n\n# How you can improve your prompting based on the science of how neural networks work.\n\n1. Prime the chat with a vector placement for its attention heads. Because the math can only be done based on text already written by you or it, the LLM needs an anchor to the subject. \n\nExample: I want to know about why I had a dream about my father in law walking in on me pooping, stripping naked, and weighing himself.  But I don\u2019t want it to hallucinate. I want facts. So I can prime the chat by saying \u201ctalk about studies with dreams\u201d. This is simple but it\u2019s undoubtedly in the realm of something the LLM has been trained on. \n\n2. Home in on your reason for prompting. If you start with a generalized token vector field, you can hone in on the exact space you want to be. \n\nExample: I want facts, so I can say something like \u201cWhat do we know for certain about dreams?\u201d\n\n3. Link it to reality. Now we\u2019ve exhausted the model\u2019s training and set the vector space in a factually based manner. But we don\u2019t know if the model has been poisoned. So we need to link it with the internet. \n\nExample: \u201cPrepare to use the internet (1). Go through your last 2 responses and find every factual claim you have made. List them all out in a table. In the second column think about how you could verify each item (2). In the third column use the internet to verify if a claim was factual or not. If you find something not factually based, fix it then continue on.\u201d\n\n(1) - notice how I primed it to let it know specifically that it needed to use the internet.\n(2) - notice how I have it talk about something you want it to do so that it can use that as \u2018logic\u2019 when it actually fact checks.\n\n4. Now you have a good positioning in the field, and your information is at least more likely to be true. Ask your question.\n\nExample: \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand a dream I had. [I put the dream here].\u201d (1)\n\n(1). Notice how I try not to say anything about what it should or shouldn\u2019t do. I just tell it what I want. I want to understand. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhen you don\u2019t prune your output, you get the redditor response. When you tell it to \u201cAct as a psychotherapist\u201d, you get a armchair redditor psychoanalytical jargon landscape. But if you give it a little training by having it talk about an idea, you place it in a vector where actual data lives. \n\nYou can do this on one shot, but I like multi shot as it improves fidelity.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kowy9k/knowing_that_a_response_is_not_answering_you_is_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK government dropped health push after lobbying by ultra-processed food firms", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/uk-government-drops-healthy-eating-push-after-lobbying-by-ultra-processed-food-firms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenWebUI &lt;&gt; N8N best integration approach, PIPE VS MCP", "summary": "Hi guys, \n\nLove openwebUI, and also the direction where N8N is going to. \n\nFor my business I am looking for the best way to combine these 2, I want to have multiple 'reasearch' flows for my consultants and sales. \n\nI Have seen the N8N Pipe by Cole, but to me it seems that the more intestering approach is to setup the MCP server node in N8N and have that have 'tools' which are exposed into openwebui to use with any model. \n\nI have tested this setup openwebUI &lt;&gt; MCPO &lt;&gt; N8N \n\nAnd it seems to work, only thing is that openwebUI does not seem to pick up all the tools sperate but as '1 tool' and MCPO does recognize it as different tools. \n\nAnyone have a tips or another approach?

I don't like role prompts. Not in the way you think, but in the way that it's been over simplified and overused. \n\nWhat do I mean? Look at all the prompts nowadays. It's always \"You are an expert xxx.\", \"you are the Oracle of Omaha.\" Does anyone using such roles even understand the purpose and how assigning roles shape and affect the LLM's evaluation? \n\nLLM, at the risk of oversimplification, are probabilistic machines. They are NOT experts. Assigning roles doesn't make them experts. \n\nAnd the biggest problem i have, is that by applying roles, the LLM portrays itself as an expert. It then activates and prioritized tokens. But these are only due to probabilities. LLMs do not inherently an expert just because it sounds like an expert. It's like kids playing King, and the king proclaims he knows what's best because he's the king.\n\nA big issue using role prompts is that you don't know the training set. There could be insufficient data for the expected role in the training data set. What happens is that the LLM will extrapolate from what it thinks it knows about the role, and may not align with your expectations. Then it'll convincingly tell you that it knows best. Thus leading to hallucinations such as fabricated contents or expert opinions.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I fully understand and appreciate the usefulness of role prompts. But it isn't a magical bandaid. Sometimes, role prompts are sufficient and useful, but you must know when to apply it. \n\nBreaking the purpose of role prompts, it does two main things. First, domain. Second, output style/tone.\n\nFor example, if you tell LLM to be Warren Buffett, think about what do you really want to achieve. Do you care about the output tone/style? You are most likely interested in stock markets and especially in predicting the stock markets (sidenote: LLMs are not stock market AI tools).\n\nIt would actually be better if your prompt says \"following the theories and practices in stock market investment\". This will guide the LLM to focus on stock market tokens (putting it loosely) than trying to emulate Warren Buffett speech and mannerisms. And you can go further to say \"based on technical analysis\". This way, you have fine grained access over how to instruct the domain. \n\nOn the flip side, if you tell LLM \"you are a university professor, explain algebra to a preschooler\". What you are trying to achieve is to control the output style/tone. The domain is implicitly define by \"algebra\", that's mathematics. In this case, the \"university lecturer\" role isn't very helpful. Why? Because it isn't defined clearly. What kind of professor? Professor of humanities? The role is simply too generic. \n\nSo, wouldn't it be easier to say \"explain algebra to a preschooler\"? The role isn't necessary. But you controlled the output. And again, you can have time grain control over the output style and tone. You can go further to say, \"for a student who haven't grasped mathematical concepts yet\".\n\nI'm not saying there's no use for role prompts. For example, \"you are jaskier, sing praises of chatgpt\". Have fun, roll with it \n\nUltimately, my point is, think about how you are using role prompts. Yes it's useful but you don't have fine control. It's better actually think about what you want. For role prompts, you can use it as a high level cue, but do back it up with details.
