I\u2019m looking at situations where you have xml markup of documents and you\u2019d like to tag it up more as an aid to future extraction processes.\n\nOk, so basic regex will do some things but it seems a natural want is to combine regex with xpath. \u201cThis pattern, where it appears in this path, wrap it thus.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a nice thought, but then you ask what happens if the path returns parent elements. Applying regex to tagged material risks the structure, and I\u2019m using xpath to avoid that. From there we could say that a basic editing process limits itself to text nodes.  It seems clear: we dial in on text nodes and then we should be free to tag a pattern we find.\n\nThen however you may need to wrap chunks in a new parent element. You might say this should be available for a single element\u2019s inner or outer content, but maybe also for contiguous siblings. Identifying and grouping contiguous siblings is dicey and, as I understand, versions of xslt after 1.0 enhanced grouping functionality.  If you can group nodes and interpolate tags into text nodes you might be in good shape.  We don\u2019t mix the two, so grouping is for whole nodes only.  A last piece, intuitively, is to \u201cuntag\u201d: throw out a tag but keep the content.\n\nThis gets to the topic of xslt. The main mental hump I see is that it feels clunky. Single responsibility principle?  Modularity? An xslt sheet seems to expect a full script for the whole transform, like an elegant piece of joinery. It may be the most efficient process in the end but that is not necessarily what I need.\n\nI am wondering then what tools are recommended for this kind of process, by those who really focus on it?

The sites include a significant cluster of five cursus monuments, the largest found in Britain and Ireland, suggesting these structures might have had ritual significance or astronomical alignments with solar events, potentially marking ceremonial routes for ancestral veneration.\n* [Early Humans Spread as Far North as Siberia 400,000 Years Ago](\u00a0\u2014 Archaeological findings in Siberia's Diring Yuriakh site suggest that early humans inhabited this area around 417,000 years ago, a significant adjustment to previous theories. This location now stands as the most ancient site known for early human habitation in such northern latitudes, pushing back the timeline for human migration into Arctic regions by nearly 400,000 years (from 45,000 years ago). The discovery opens up possibilities regarding the paths early humans may have taken into other continents, as well as how long ago humans crossed over to North America.\n\n* [Social Decline and Genetic Diversity of the Y Chromosome](\u00a0\u2014 A study of 20 years\u2019 worth of anthropological data, primarily in Asia, indicated that the significant decline in the genetic diversity of the Y chromosome 3,000-5,000 years ago was not due to men dying in battle as had previously been theorized. The reduced diversity is actually due to societal changes like the emergence of patrilineal social systems. This led to fewer fathers, but more offspring, establishing a \"founder effect\" in genetic terms. Another example is the splitting of clans into subclans. These societal changes profoundly shaped the genetic landscape of modern human populations, pointing to a crucial period where social structures and practices influenced genetic evolution.\n* [Carbonized Herculaneum Papyrus Reveals Burial Place of Plato](\u00a0\u2014 A recent analysis of a carbonized papyrus scroll from Herculaneum, an ancient Roman town, has uncovered significant details about Plato's burial. The scroll, deciphered through modern imaging techniques, contains about 3,000 words, 1,000 of which were readable. It offers insights into Plato's Platonic Academy, his enslavement by the Spartans, and his burial in a private garden near the Museion in Athens.\n* [1,700-Year-Old Roman Ruins Discovered Atop Much Older Neolithic Sacred Spring](\u00a0\u2014 If you\u2019ve been reading the Beat for a while, you know I love the topic of springs. Well, near Limoges, France, archaeologists have discovered Roman ruins from the 3rd century CE, built over a Neolithic sacred spring dating back 4,500 to 6,000 years. From Roman times, the site features a landscaped pool, a protective granite wall, and artifacts including coins and ceramic representations of deities. But the Neolithic is also in the mix thanks to flint offerings, including a dagger fragment.
