They found the models to be of limited help.\r\n\r\n2/ According to the participants, the AI-generated material sounded bland, stereotypical, and reminiscent of outdated comedy styles. They also criticized the AI for being biased against minorities and for lacking the context, life experience, and emotion that are essential to good comedy.\r\n\r\n3/ The researchers suggest that language models should be made more responsive to the needs of creative communities. Despite the potential for AI to speed up the creative process, humorous writing remains a domain in which humans are superior to machines.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1dkh7n0/ai_walks_into_comedy_club_and_promptly_gets_booed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UAE to permit abortions in rape and incest cases in landmark legal reform", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/uae/2024/06/20/uae-to-permit-abortions-in-rape-and-incest-cases-in-landmark-legal-reform/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Armenia recognizes the State of Palstine", "summary": "", "link": "https://en.armradio.am/2024/06/21/armenia-recognizes-the-state-of-palestine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cargo from 'most ancient' shipwreck found off Israel", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedd0l1wk8qo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India Could Help the U.S. to Tech Victory Over China", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-could-help-the-u-s-to-tech-victory-over-china-dd624fe6", "author": "None"}, {"title": "why don't India along with other south east and central asian countries create a NATO like organisation against china ", "summary": "NATO is created to withstand expansionist policies of soviet union by a group of countries.
