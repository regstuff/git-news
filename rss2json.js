The pair, who had refugee status, are alleged to have passed information to Moscow about Russian opposition figures in Poland. The husband is additionally accused of sending a package containing explosives.\n\nThe couple, who can be named only as Igor R. and Irina R. under Polish privacy law, were pictured arriving at court in the city of Sosnowiec on Tuesday. However, the trial has been closed to the public at the request of prosecutors to protect information relating to national security.\n\nAs he was escorted to the hearing by police officers, Igor R. (pictured above) was seen holding a sign containing the words (in English) \u201cPutin\u201d and \u201cRussia\u201d and (in Russian) \u201cfuck war\u201d.\n\nThe capitalised \u201cN\u201d in Putin was turned on its side to look like a \u201cZ\u201d (the symbol of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine) with a line crossing it out, while the Russian letter \u201cO\u201d had been turned into a peace symbol.\n\nThe couple had previously been students at the University of Silesia and both had refugee status in Poland, reports broadcaster TVN. Igor had been an active member of Russian opposition groups while still in Russia.\n\nBut, according to prosecutors, between February and August 2022, Igor R. cooperated with Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB), including by collecting intelligence on Russian opposition figures. Irina R. then sought to pass the information on to the FSB on an electronic storage device.\n\nIgor R. is additionally accused of working as part of a group \u2013 also containing another Russian and two Ukrainian citizens \u2013 to send a parcel containing a nitroglycerin-based explosive and military-grade electronic detonators.\n\nThe group sought to have the package transported by a courier company, and it was discovered in a warehouse in Poland belonging to the delivery firm.\n\nThe couple, who were detained in July 2024 and\u00a0[indicted in October 2025]( are both charged with espionage. However, because their alleged offences occurred before the relevant law was toughened to increase penalties to up to life in prison, they would face up to 15 years if convicted.\n\nIgor R. is additionally charged with causing a large-scale threat to the lives or health of other people or to property, which is punishable by up to eight years in prison.\n\nIgor R.\u2019s defence lawyer, Marta Smo\u0142ka, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that they were opposed to the trial being held behind closed doors given that \u201cthere\u2019s so much \\[information\\] circulating in the public sphere\u201d already.

Now we\u2019ve got the inverse: if you want to use your right to die, you have to convince an AI that you are mentally capable of making such a decision.\n\n&gt;According to Futurism, the creator of a controversial assisted-suicide device known as the Sarco has introduced a psychiatric test administered by AI to determine if a person is of sound enough mind to decide to end their life. If they are deemed of sound mind by the AI, the suicide pod will be powered on, and they will have up to 24 hours to decide to move forward to their final destination. If they miss the window, they\u2019ll have to start over.\n\n&gt;The Sarco that is central to this whole thing has already stirred up quite a bit of controversy before introducing the AI mental fitness test. Named after the sarcophagus by inventor Philip Nitschke, the Sarco was built in 2019 and used for the first time in 2024 when a 64-year-old American woman who had been suffering from complications associated with a severely compromised immune system, underwent the process of self-administered euthanasia in Switzerland, where assisted suicide is technically legal. She reportedly underwent a traditional psychiatric evaluation conducted by a Dutch psychiatrist before she pressed a button that released nitrogen within the capsule and ended her life because the AI assessment wasn\u2019t ready at the time.\n\n&gt;However, the use of the Sarco resulted in the arrest of Dr. Florian Willet, a pro-assisted suicide advocate who was present for the woman\u2019s death. Swiss law enforcement arrested the doctor on the grounds of aiding and abetting a suicide. Under the country\u2019s laws, assisted suicide is allowed as long as the person takes their own life with no \u201cexternal assistance,\u201d and those who help the person die must not do so for \u201cany self-serving motive.\u201d Dr. Willet would later die by assisted suicide in Germany in 2025, reportedly in part due to the psychological trauma he experienced following his arrest and detention.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s unclear if Willet was evaluated using the new AI assessment, but Nitschke will apparently include the new test in his latest version of the Sarco that he designed for couples, according to the Daily Mail. The \u201cDouble Dutch\u201d model will evaluate both partners and allow them to enter a conjoined pod so they can pass on to the next life while lying next to each other.\n\n&gt;The whole thing does raise a question, though: why do you need AI for this? They were able to find a psychiatrist for the one use of the pod thus far, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re doing this at such a volume that they need to pass the assessment off to AI to expedite the process. Whatever your stance on assisted suicide may be, the inclusion of an AI test over a human assessment feels like it undermines the dignity of choosing to die. A person at the end of their life deserves to be taken seriously and receive human consideration, not pass a CAPTCHA.", "link": "https://gizmodo.com/controversial-swiss-suicide-pod-gets-an-ai-powered-mental-fitness-upgrade-2000712092", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Nigeria] Police dismantle child trafficking syndicate, rescue 8-year-old in Nasarawa", "summary": "", "link": "https://zagazola.org/index.php/breaking-news/police-dismantle-child-trafficking-syndicate-rescue-8-year-old-in-nasarawa", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Uganda's internet shutdown: Slashed incomes and gamers go cold turkey", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2p54rm4k4o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Arrests made in Berlin and Brandenburg as police target pro-Russian networks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/2026/01/21/arrests-made-in-berlin-and-brandenburg-as-police-target-pro-russian-networks", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Syria: Kobane under serious threat as Damascus-linked factions besiege city", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/200120261", "author": "None"}, {"title": "International aid groups are dealing with the pain of slashed USAID funding by cutting staff, localizing and coordinating better", "summary": "", "link": "https://theconversation.com/international-aid-groups-are-dealing-with-the-pain-of-slashed-usaid-funding-by-cutting-staff-localizing-and-coordinating-better-273184", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Papuan shadow over Indonesian role at UN human rights body", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/583971/papuan-shadow-over-indonesian-role-at-un-human-rights-body", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tom Barrack\u2019s Not-So-Excellent Syrian Adventure.
