For every crime and every war, you simply have to pay and apologise. Only then will we be able to feel that we have fulfilled our duty.\u201d\n\nThis year marks the first time that Nawrocki, an academic historian who was previously director of the Museum of the Second World War in Gda\u0144sk, has commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day as president.\n\nNazi Germany killed over a million people, the majority of them Jews, at the camp, which it had established in 1940 on occupied Polish territory that after the war again became part of Poland.\n\n\u201cPoland is the custodian of the truth about German crimes and the custodian of the truth about the victims who died here, over 1 million of them,\u201d declared Nawrocki. \u201cAuschwitz remains a symbol of utter dehumanisation, complete barbarity; it was a death factory organised by the Germans.\u201d\n\nYet after the war, the president argued, \u201cwe remembered the victims but we forgot the perpetrators\u201d. He claimed that only 15% of the perpetrators in Nazi-German camps were brought to justice. Meanwhile, the German state has not paid Poland reparations.\n\nIn 2021, Poland, which was at the time ruled by the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party,\u00a0[demanded that Germany pay $1.3 trillion](\u00a0in reparations for the damage it caused during the war. Germany has rejected that claim, arguing that the question of reparations was\u00a0[legally resolved](\u00a0in the past.\n\nPiS lost power in 2023, and the current Polish government has not pursued the reparations claim. However, Nawrocki, who is aligned with PiS, has done so, including\u00a0[on a visit to Berlin last year](\n\nIn his speech at Auschwitz today, Nawrocki emphasised repeatedly that it was Germany as a nation that was responsible for Nazi atrocities.\n\n\u201cIt was the German nation that supported the ideology of National Socialism and allowed Adolf Hitler to come to power,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt was the German people and the German state that brought about the crime we know as the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nNawrocki also noted that, before the systematic mass murder of Jews began in 1941, there was, to use the words of historian Richard C. Lukas, a \u201cforgotten Holocaust\u201d against ethnic Poles carried out by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union after they both invaded and occupied Poland in 1939.\n\nHe recalled that the first transport of prisoners to Auschwitz in 1940 was made up of 728 Poles. The second largest group of victims of the camp, after Jews, were ethnic Poles.\n\nThe Polish president argued that, if the Western world had not shown \u201cindifference\u201d to crimes being committed against Poles early in the war, perhaps later atrocities might not have taken place. \u201cAuschwitz might not have happened if the reaction had been appropriate much earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to remember the tragedy of the Holocaust, but also to remember what happened before 1939 and before 1942\u2026\\[and\\] what happened after 1945,\u201d when Poland fell under brutal Soviet-backed communist rule, said the Polish president.\n\nAfter his speech, Nawrocki took part in a memorial ceremony for victims of the camp, which was attended by Holocaust survivors as well as Poland\u2019s culture minister, Marta Cienkowska.\n\nThe president, who was the honorary patron of today\u2019s ceremonial events at Auschwitz, which is now a\u00a0[Polish state museum]( then placed a candle on behalf of survivors at the International Monument to the Victims of Fascism, which is located in the former camp.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/27/president-calls-for-germany-to-pay-poland-reparations-in-auschwitz-speech-on-holocaust-remembrance-day/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Language-agnostic text normalization for WER", "summary": "Hi!

They were seen as playing a key role in PiS\u2019s efforts to bring the judiciary under greater political control.\n\nPiS lost power in December 2023, but the trio remained in their positions, as their four-year terms were due to run until June 2026. However, in April last year, Bodnar dismissed Schab and Radzik. Then, when Bodnar was replaced by \u017burek in July, one of the new justice minister\u2019s\u00a0[first actions](\u00a0was to remove Lasota from his position.\n\nBodnar and \u017burek argued that, because the relevant regulations do not provide any means for the premature removal of disciplinary officers, the body that appointed them has the authority to dismiss them if there are compelling reasons to do so.\n\nThey said that removing the trio was justified by a series of disciplinary proceedings initiated against them and by their \u201cgroundless\u201d actions against judges who were critical of the changes introduced under the former PiS government.\n\nThat position has, however, now been decisively rejected by the professional liability chamber of Poland\u2019s Supreme Court, which found that a public authority may not act unless it is expressly authorised to do so by statute.\n\n\u201cThis rule does not provide for any exceptions,\u201d the chamber wrote in its justification, quoted by the\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0daily. \u201cCompetence cannot be presumed.\u201d\n\nThe chamber also rejected the legitimacy of the individuals appointed last year to replace the unlawfully removed officials. \u201cOnly one person can hold such a position at a time. Therefore, it is not possible to appoint a new \\[person\\] to a position that is already occupied,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cIn a democratic state governed by the rule of law, it is unacceptable for courts to accept actions by public authorities undertaken without a proper legal basis,\u201d declared the chamber.\n\nAsked by a journalist at a press conference to comment on the ruling, \u017burek claimed that the professional liability chamber is an \u201cimproperly established chamber\u201d whose legality is \u201cquestioned by many lawyers\u201d.\n\nThat is because it contains some judges who were improperly appointed to the Supreme Court under PiS\u2019s judicial reforms and others who were \u201cinstrumentally chosen\u201d by former PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda.\n\n\u201cWhen we create a court based on an individual decision by a politician, the case law we have may already reveal that it is not a court at all,\u201d said \u017burek, quoted by news website wPolityce.\n\nHowever, both wPolityce and\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0note that the ruling in question was issued by so-called \u201cold\u201d judges who were appointed to the Supreme Court before PiS\u2019s\u00a0[politicisation of the National Council of the Judiciary](\u00a0(KRS), which\u00a0[rendered subsequent appointments invalid](\n\nFrom the outset, Schab, Radzik and Lasota did not accept their dismissals, considering themselves to be still legally serving as disciplinary officers. As a result, they continued to occupy their offices and refused to hand over documentation relating to disciplinary cases involving judges.\n\nIn an interview with television station wPolsce24, Schab said that his dismissal showed that \u201cthe executive branch is destroying the independence of the judiciary\u201d and that the fixed term of office for a disciplinary officer \u201cis intended to protect the independence of judges from the executive branch\u201d.\n\nLast week, police and prosecutors entered Schab, Radzik and Lasota\u2019s offices and demanded that the head of the secretariat hand over their case files. However, after they refused to do so, \u201cit became necessary to open them mechanically\u201d, say prosecutors.\n\nIn response to the raid, PiS-aligned President Karol Nawrocki said that the development was \u201cvery concerning\u201d. However, \u017burek described it as a \u201croutine action\u201d necessitated by the fact that the disciplinary officers had not handed over the documents after they were dismissed.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/27/supreme-court-rules-polish-government-unlawfully-removed-judicial-officials/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Korea's ex-first lady jailed for 20 months for bribery", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevnppplkjjo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland to receive 44 Billion \u20ac for security - Green light from European Comission", "summary": "# \u20ac44 Billion for Poland's Security: European Commission Gives the Green Light\n\n\"The European Commission has issued a positive opinion on the documents submitted by Poland regarding the acquisition of funds from the\u00a0**SAFE program**,\" announced Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz on Monday.\n\nKosiniak-Kamysz shared the news of Brussels' decision on the X platform\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk also commented on the decision via X\n\n# Key Details of the Polish Plan\n\nAccording to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), the national plan approved by the Commission involves:\n\n* **Total Funding:**\u00a0\u20ac43.7 billion (approximately 184 billion PLN at current rates).\n* **Scope:**\u00a0Financing for\u00a0**139 separate projects**.\n* **Other Approvals:**\u00a0On Monday, the EC also approved plans submitted by Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Finland.\n\n# Poland as the Primary Beneficiary\n\nPoland is set to be the largest recipient of the SAFE program.
