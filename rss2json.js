Others criticise the pro-EU government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The channel\u2019s profile description also included an anti-EU slogan associated with Polish\u00a0[radical-right leader Grzegorz Braun]( who supports Polexit.\n\nOn Tuesday, deputy digital affairs minister Dariusz Standerski noted that, \u201cin recent days, TikTok has seen a surge of videos generated using AI, spreading disinformation regarding Poland\u2019s membership in the European Union. The scale of this practice may suggest that we are dealing with an organised campaign\u201d.\n\nGovernment spokesman Adam Sz\u0142aka, meanwhile, declared that \u201cthere is no doubt that this was Russian disinformation\u201d. He noted that some of the texts spoken in the video contained Russian syntax.\u00a0\n\nStanderski also shared a copy of a letter he had sent to Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, requesting that she initiate proceedings against TikTok under the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nIn the letter, he argued that the videos \u201cpose a threat to public order, information security, and the integrity of democratic processes in Poland and across the European Union\u201d.\n\n\u201cAvailable information suggests that TikTok has not implemented adequate mechanisms for moderating AI-generated content,\u201d added the minister, \u201cnor has it ensured effective transparency measures regarding the origin of such materials.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cundermines the objectives of the Digital Services Act concerning the prevention of disinformation and the protection of users\u201d. The DSA is an EU regulation that went into force in 2022 and aims to regulate the accountability, moderation and transparency of digital services.\n\nEarlier this month, social media platform X became the first to be[\u00a0found not to be in compliance](\u00a0with the DSA, resulting in it being fined \u20ac120 million by the European Commission.\n\nThe channel sharing the AI-generated videos has now been removed from TikTok after numerous complaints against it by individual users, reports news website Interia.\n\nInvestigative news service Konkret24 notes that the channel had existed since May 2023 but previously operated under a different name and posted videos in English unrelated to Poland. Only on 13 December 2025 did it change its name to a Polish one and begin publishing the videos about Polexit.\n\nRecent opinion polls have indicated\u00a0[growing support for Polexit]( with two surveys this month showing that 25% of Poles now think that their country should leave the EU. However, a majority still favour remaining in the bloc.\n\nGrowing anti-EU sentiment has coincided with a\u00a0[rise in support for Braun]( who finished a surprise fourth in this year\u2019s presidential election, and his Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP) party.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/31/poland-calls-for-eu-action-against-ai-generated-tiktok-videos-calling-for-polexit/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mexico to hike tariffs on Asian countries starting Thursday", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexico-hike-tariffs-china-starting-thursday-2025-12-30/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Number of people who say Britons must be \u2018born British\u2019 is rising, study shows", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/29/number-people-britons-must-be-born-in-uk-rising-study?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish farmers stage nationwide protest against EU\u2019s planned Mercosur free trade deal", "summary": "Polish farmers have today staged nationwide protests against a planned free trade agreement between the European Union and South America\u2019s Mercosur bloc. They argue that the deal, which is also opposed by the Polish government, would threaten European agriculture and food safety.\n\nDemonstrations were planned in 186 locations around the country. In Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2019s second-largest city, a column of farmers and their supporters marched through the streets. \u201cWe want to live with dignity, and feed you well,\u201d read one placard.\n\nIn some places, tractors were used to block or slow traffic. Around 30 tractors blocked one of two lanes on national road 50 near Warsaw, reported broadcaster TVN.\n\nFarmers argue that the proposed EU-Mercosur deal would open European markets to cheaper food produced to lower standards, thereby undermining local farms already struggling with what they describe as a lack of effective protection.\n\nAlthough Poland is among a minority of EU states that have\u00a0[voiced opposition](\u00a0to the agreement, and Prime Minister Donald Tusk has recently reiterated that position, farmers say they must continue protesting because the Polish government has not done enough to protect their interests.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the protests is not to express opposition \u2018on principle\u2019, but to exert political pressure at the last possible moment,\u201d Agnieszka Beger of Grassroots National Farmers\u2019 Protest (OOPR), the movement coordinating the protests, told financial news service Money.pl.\n\nOOPR says protests are the result of the \u201cpassivity and ineffectiveness of the Polish government regarding the EU-Mercosur agreement\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the Polish government had acted effectively during the negotiations, built a real coalition of countries opposing the agreement, and enforced genuine market protection mechanisms, farmers would not have had to protest today,\u201d the movement said in a\u00a0[Facebook post](\n\n\u201cPlacing the blame solely on the European Union is a simplification that does not reflect the truth,\u201d it added.\n\nHowever, in a statement yesterday, the agriculture minister declared that the government is \u201cfulfilling its promises to Polish farmers\u201d by \u201cleading a diplomatic offensive\u201d in Brussels in order to \u201cbuild a coalition \\[of member states\\] to block the \\[Mercosur\\] agreement\u201d.\n\nThe French and Italian governments have also recently expressed reservations about the Mercosur deal, with both Emmanuel Macron and Giorgia Meloni voicing concern about its impact on local agriculture.\n\nSpeaking amid today\u2019s protests, agriculture minister Stefan Krajewski said that, if it is not possible to build a blocking minority, Poland would propose measures to financially compensate farmers for losses caused by the deal.\n\nBut Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, today declared that \u201cthe Tusk government is deceiving the Polish public by doing nothing to block this agreement\u201d. He said that the farmers \u201care protesting in the interest of us all\u201d.\n\nNegotiations between Brussels and the Mercosur bloc, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay, have been ongoing for decades.\n\nThe currently proposed deal would grant tariff preferences for South American products such as beef, poultry, dairy, sugar and ethanol, while opening Mercosur markets to European industrial goods. There had been talk of signing the agreement this month, but reports now suggest it will happen in January.\n\nIn the meantime, farmers\u00a0from several EU countries, including Poland, Italy and France, protested in Brussels in mid-December.\n\nOn 17 December, the European Council and European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on safeguard measures intended to protect EU agricultural producers if they suffer harm from the Mercosur agreement.\n\nHowever, a vote on whether to approve the measures has been repeatedly postponed, reportedly because they lack enough support among member states, according to news service Euractiv.\n\nRobert Kuryluk, an organic farmer from eastern Poland, told Notes from Poland that, even if the safeguards are introduced, they do not do enough to protect the sector.\n\nHe also accused the EU of hypocrisy, saying that it claims to care for the environment but that the result of the Mercosur deal would be \u201cthousands of hectares of rainforest being cut down\u201d so that food can \u201cbe sold cheaply to wealthy Europe\u201d.\n\nKuryluk said that Brussels is sacrificing European agriculture for the benefit of other industries: \u201cIn exchange for the automotive and agrochemical sectors thriving, European agriculture will be destroyed.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/30/polish-farmers-stage-nationwide-protest-against-eus-planned-mercosur-free-trade-deal/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "German bank heist: Thieves use drill to steal \u20ac30m from savings bank", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grzz60kp3o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Korea's birthrate increases for 16th consecutive month in October", "summary": "South Korea's fertility rate stands at 0.83 births per woman.

Around 20 million barrels of Nigerian crude and up to six Angolan cargoes for December and January remained unsold this week, reflecting a broader global supply surplus that has weighed on prices. Brent crude fell below $60 a barrel, its lowest level since May. Analysts say softer seasonal demand, high freight costs and shifting buying patterns are slowing trade. Middle Eastern supplies, helped by lower official selling prices and shorter shipping routes, are displacing West African grades in Asia, while Russia continues to dominate India\u2019s imports. China has also turned to cheaper or closer alternatives, leaving January trade in Angola well behind average levels. In Nigeria, reduced purchases by the Dangote refinery ahead of January maintenance have added to the overhang.\n\nGhana\u2019s parliament on Thursday approved amendments to the Bank of Ghana Act aimed at tightening limits on central bank financing of the government and strengthening the bank\u2019s independence. The Bank of Ghana (Amendment) Bill, 2025 bars the central bank from purchasing government securities on the primary market and narrows the definition of emergencies that previously allowed lending beyond a 5% cap of the prior year\u2019s revenues. Emergencies are now limited to force majeure events such as natural disasters, public health crises or presidentially declared emergencies. The reforms follow criticism of extensive central bank support during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, when Ghana lost access to international markets, inflation surged, and the Bank of Ghana recorded negative equity. The law also tightens board eligibility rules, enhances audit oversight and aligns with Ghana\u2019s 2023 IMF programme to curb inflation and restore investor confidence.\n\nCocoa prices rose for a second consecutive session in New York on Wednesday as traders reassessed expectations of a market oversupply and tightening procurement conditions. Cocoa futures climbed 1.5% to $6,066 per metric ton, extending a rebound after losses earlier in the week. Sentiment has improved after Citigroup cut its forecast for a global cocoa surplus this season by 41% to 79,000 tons, signalling a tighter balance than previously expected. While cocoa deliveries to export ports from top producer Ivory Coast, remain strong, exchange-monitored inventories in the United States continue to fall. They are now at their lowest level since March, providing further price support. Prices could gain additional momentum from cocoa\u2019s inclusion in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which Citigroup estimates could attract about $2 billion in inflows in early January. Robusta coffee slipped 1.5%, while raw sugar edged slightly lower.\n\nZambia\u2019s President Hakainde Hichilema on Thursday signed into law constitutional amendments expanding parliament, a move critics say could advantage the ruling party ahead of elections due in August 2026. The changes raise the number of members of parliament to about 280 from 167 by creating new constituencies, introducing 40 reserved seats for women, youth and people with disabilities, and increasing presidential appointees to 11 from eight. Critics, including the Catholic Church and opposition figures, argue the reforms were rushed through parliament and could tilt the electoral field in favour of Hichilema\u2019s party. Civil rights activist Brebner Changala said the delimitation process could be used to entrench the ruling party\u2019s strongholds. Hichilema, who is seeking a second term, rejected the criticism, saying the reforms were made in good faith after consultations and were needed because some constituencies were too large for effective service delivery.", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2025/12/daily-watch-west-african-crude-struggles-for-buyers-ghana-tightens-central-bank-financing-rules/#gsc.tab=0", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
