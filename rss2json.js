They want to have an LLM, using PDFs (100+ page quarterly/annual reports) and asking it questions. \n\nExample questions might be:\n\n  \n\\* What is &lt;company&gt;'s EBITDA growth quarter over quarter for the past four years?\n\n\\* What is the latest Daily Active Users? Are we keeping most of them, or are we just churning?\n\n  \nI can do this in two ways:\n\na) go with a RAG approach - I am not a fan of this, since the question might be semantically different from the required information.\n\nb) find a LLM with big context. I know Gemini 1.5 has a million-token context, which might fit some of the PDFs, especially if I go with a multi-step prompt. \n\n\n\nNow, I have a couple of questions I'd appreciate hints on:\n\n1. What open source models have big context, and ideally are also multi-modal (for graphs and such)? I read the [Unlimiformer]( paper, and it seems very promising; do you have any other suggestions if I go the huge-context route?\n\n2. How would you do citations? I would \\*not\\* want the model to hallucinate the answers, so ideally I'd like to have the model return the relevant sections. This might be a bit easier with the RAG approach; how would you do it if you just had a huge context window?\n\n3. In your opinion, is fine-tuning worth it? I might prepare a set of 100-200 questions and their \"ideal\" answers; a 1000 seems too much for the amount of time I will have. \n\n4. Finally, regarding the PDFs: do you think I should try to convert them to raw text + images; or should I instead search for LLMs who handle PDFs? I lean toward the first approach. \n\n  \nI'd appreciate any ideas/feedback/hints/experience you might share.   \nThanks.
