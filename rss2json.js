I am currently experimenting with various Q4 quants, with or without imatrix, to see which one will work better, and it would be great if I could also create my own dynamic quants.\n\nDynamic quants by unsloth are quite good, but they are not available for every model. For example, DeepSeek R1T Chimera has only [Q4\\_K\\_M]( quant but it fails many tests like\u00a0[solving mazes]( or have lesser success rate than my own Q6\\_K quant that I generated locally, which can consistently solve the maze. So I know it is quant issue and not a model issue. Usually failure to solve the maze indicates too much quantization or that it wasn't done perfectly. Unsloth's old R1 quant at Q4\\_K\\_M level did not have such issue, and dynamic quants are supposed to be even better. This is why I am interested in learning from their experience creating quants.\n\nMy motivation in this case is that neither V3 or R1 on their own are sufficient for me, and I end up switching between the two. I use DeepSeek V3 UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL quant as my daily driver, getting 8 tokens/s on my rig (EPYC 7763 + 1 TB 3200MHz + 4x3090, using ik\\_llama.cpp). However, some tasks need reasoning and even though R1 works, it generates a lot of tokens, while Chimera can accomplish the same tasks in nearly all cases by generating noticeably less tokens, which makes a huge difference in my case.
