Fine-tuned LLMs and AI agents are being tested in financial security for:\n\n* Cross-referencing financial documents (invoices, POs, receipts) to detect inconsistencies \n* Identifying phishing emails and scam attempts with fine-tuned classifiers \n* Analyzing transactional data for fraud risk assessment in real time\n\nThe question remains: How effective are fine-tuned LLMs in identifying financial fraud compared to traditional approaches? What challenges are developers facing in training these models to reduce false positives while maintaining high detection rates?\n\nThere\u2019s an upcoming live session showcasing how to build AI agents for fraud detection using fine-tuned LLMs and rule-based techniques.\n\nCurious to hear what the community thinks\u2014how is AI currently being applied to fraud detection in real-world use cases?\n\nIf this is an area of interest register to the webinar: [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ijy7t3/finetuning_llms_for_fraud_detectionwhere_are_we/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India\u2019s attempt to save the tiger has been a remarkable success", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/02/06/indias-attempt-to-save-the-tiger-has-been-a-remarkable-success", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Reports: Morocco, 2 disputed Somalia regions considered as destinations for Gazans", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/reports-morocco-2-disputed-somalia-regions-considered-as-destinations-for-gazans/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Review finds women health sector leaders good for a nation's wealth, health, innovation, ethics", "summary": "", "link": "https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-02-women-health-sector-leaders-good.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Second Person Has Received a Pig Kidney Transplant", "summary": "", "link": "https://time.com/7213805/pig-kidney-transplant-second-patient/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cocaine is \u2018no worse than whisky,\u2019 Colombian president says | CNN", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/07/americas/cocaine-whiskey-colombian-president-intl-hnk/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India hits 100 GW solar milestone", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/02/07/india-hits-100-gw-solar-milestone/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh asks India to stop ousted PM Hasina making 'false statements'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-asks-india-stop-former-pm-hasina-making-false-statements-2025-02-07/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
