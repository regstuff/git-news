I would basically find the sub space (plane) that is spanned by word 1 and word 2, then project each other vector onto that, the find cosine similarity between each vector and its projection on the plane. I think the outcome tends to return words that are extremely similar to either word 1 or 2, instead of a blend of the two like I would hope for, but still a WIP.\n\nAnyways, my main question is if the word2vec google news embedding is the best for messing around with general semantics (I hope that\u2019s the right word) or meaning. Are there newer or better suited open source embeddings I should use?\n\nThanks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jja327/types_of_word_embeddings/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Denmark's defense committee head said he regrets choosing the F-35: 'We must avoid American weapons if at all possible'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/denmark-f35-regret-choosing-defense-committee-chairman-tensions-us-greenland-2025-3", "author": "None"}, {"title": "profullstack/reddit-networking-bot", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/profullstack/reddit-networking-bot", "author": "None"}, {"title": "20 Best Programming Half Price Books 2025", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/half-price-books-near-me", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Millions of people\u2019s DNA up for sale as 23andMe goes bankrupt", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/24/millions-of-peoples-dna-up-for-sale-as-23andme-goes-bankrup/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Paralysed man stands again after receiving \u2018reprogrammed\u2019 stem cells", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00863-0?linkId=13622861", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan's cherry blossom season begins as first blooms appear in Tokyo", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/japan-cherry-blossom-opening-fb4874d65691cc263d4f6323bf2dabc3", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India must be cautious in trade pact talks with US amid legislative risks in America: GTRI", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-must-be-cautious-in-trade-pact-talks-with-us-amid-legislative-risks-in-america-gtri/articleshow/119462937.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GenderBench - Evaluation suite for gender biases in LLMs", "summary": "Hey,\n\nI would like to introduce GenderBench -- an open-source tool designed to evaluate gender biases in LLMs. There are million benchmarks for measuring raw performance, but benchmarks for various risks, such as societal biases, do not have a fraction of that attention.
