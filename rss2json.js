Plastics are projected to drive new oil demand in the next few decades.\nLego's suppliers are using bio-waste such as cooking oil or food industry waste fat as well as recycled materials to replace virgin fossil fuels in plastic production.\n\nThe market for recycled or renewable plastic is still in its infancy, partly because most available feedstock is used for subsidised biodiesel, which is mixed into transportation fuels.\nAccording to Neste, the world's largest producer of renewable feedstocks, fossil-based plastic is about half or a third of the price of sustainable options.\n\"We sense more activity and willingness to invest in this now than we did just a year ago,\" said Christiansen.
