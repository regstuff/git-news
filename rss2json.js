I've been interested in trading for a long time, especially forex and commodities. I did the BabyPips course, but midway, I realized how much news influences the market than technical analysis (I\u2019m leaning toward a more fundamentally driven perspective). Every time I see posts about people making money from event-driven trading, I think, \"I COULD DO THE SAME,\" but either I was unaware of the news due to my classes, I was sleeping or doing something else, or it was just too late to act on it.\n\nThat\u2019s when I explored algo trading. While it mainly focuses on numerical price patterns, it has a very limited scope for capturing sudden market shifts driven by social sentiment or breaking news.\n\nSo now, I\u2019m conceptualizing a system that continuously scrapes social media, using NLP and LLM-based methods to detect emerging narratives and sentiment spikes before they fully impact the market and automate the trading process. It\u2019s just a concept idea, and I\u2019m looking for people who are interested in working on this heck of a project and brainstorming together. I know similar systems are already out there being used by HFTs, but they\u2019re proprietary.\n\n**TL;DR**: I\u2019m a CS student interested in developing an automated event-driven news trading AI agent and am reaching out to people who are interested in working together.
