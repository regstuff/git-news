I'm looking for advice on the best approach or model to use for this task.\n\nHere are some examples of the input and output:\n\nExample 1:\n\n- Input: \"Latoya Wolf christopher50@example.org\"\n\n- Output:\n\n{\n\n\"info\": \\[\n\n{\n\n\"fullname\": \"Latoya Wolf\",\n\n\"email\": \"christopher50@example.org\"\n\n}\n\n\\]\n\n}\n\nExample 2:\n\n- Input: \"ayoub@test.com\"\n\n- Output:\n\n{\n\n\"info\": \\[\n\n{\n\n\"fullname\": null,\n\n\"email\": \"ayoub@test.com\"\n\n}\n\n\\]\n\n}\n\nThe main challenges I'm facing are ensuring the accuracy of the extracted data and handling cases where certain fields might be missing (e.g., the fullname, ...). I'd appreciate any suggestions on which models or techniques might work best, or if there are any specific resources or examples that could guide me in the right direction.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1evzxiu/need_help_with_finetuning_a_model_for_texttojson/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine blows up key bridges and says aim is to carve out a buffer zone inside Russia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-blows-up-bridges-seim-river-kursk-disrupt-russian-supply-lines-rcna167111", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mohammed bin Salman: Spies and diplomats reveal inside story of the Saudi crown prince", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz8934wrro", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rags to riches: Girl (16) transformed neglected rescue pony into Dublin Horse Show qualifier", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2024/08/17/rags-to-riches-girl-16-transformed-neglected-rescue-pony-into-dublin-horse-show-qualifier/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018A revolution is building\u2019: can young people force change across Africa? \u2022 Africa has the youngest population of any continent, and recent protests in Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda suggest growing youth disillusionment.
