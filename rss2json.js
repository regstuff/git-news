Pressed by Lanz about, for example, Russia\u2019s hybrid actions against European states, Chrupalla responded that \u201cany country can be a threat to Germany\u201d.\n\n\u201cTake Poland \u2013 of course, Poland could also be a threat to us,\u201d he continued, pointing to the recent decision \u201cnot to extradite a wanted criminal, a terrorist to Germany\u201d. Last month, a Polish court\u00a0[refused to extradite](\u00a0to Germany a Ukrainian man accused of involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying Poland is potentially as dangerous for Germany as Russia?\u201d asked Lanz, to which Chrupalla replied: \u201cIn this case, we can see it. Poland\u2019s economic interests differ from Germany\u2019s \u2013 just like Russia\u2019s.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in his remarks, the far-right leader also sought to provide \u201ccontext\u201d for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 by arguing that the conflict actually began as a \u201ccivil war\u201d in 2014, when \u201copposition figures were persecuted in Ukraine \\[and\\] the language of the Russian-speaking minority was targeted\u201d.\n\n\n\nChrupalla\u2019s comments, including those about Poland being a threat to Germany, were quickly condemned by Roderich Kiesewetter, a politician from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), part of Germany\u2019s ruling coalition, who had been criticised by Chrupalla.\n\n\u201cTino Chrupalla\u2019s statements have shown where the AfD stands: it is a Putin club that would rather submit to a dictator than defend European and thus also German freedom,\u201d Kiesewetter told\u00a0*Frankfurter Rundschau*.\n\nIn May 2023, Chrupalla received criticism for attending a reception at the Russian embassy in Berlin for an event marking Russia\u2019s celebration of Victory Day.\n\nHe has also rejected claims that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal and last year refused, along with Weidel and other AfD figures, to attend a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the German parliament.\n\n\n\nIn Germany\u2019s parliamentary elections earlier this year, AfD emerged as the second-largest party, winning almost 21% of the vote. However, it was left in opposition after the CDU and Social Democratic Party (SPD) formed a coalition government.\n\nLast year, after elections to the European Parliament, half of MEPs from Poland\u2019s far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) party\u00a0[agreed to join](\u00a0the new European of Sovereign Nations group created by AfD.\n\nHowever, other Confederation MEPs said they refused to align with the AfD given \u201cthe statements of some members of the group, which are directly contrary to the Polish national interest\u201d.\n\nPrevious statements by leading AfD figures downplaying Nazi crimes have provoked anger in Poland. In 2020, when the German parliament\u00a0[approved plans](\u00a0for a memorial in Berlin to Polish victims of World War Two, AfD was the only party not to vote in favour, instead abstaining.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/12/leader-of-far-right-afd-suggests-poland-as-great-a-threat-to-germany-as-russia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Attack planned on mosque in Galway was 'imminent', garda\u00ed tell court", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thejournal.ie/attack-on-mosque-galway-was-imminent-gardai-tell-court-laois-6873973-Nov2025/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Corruption investigation reveals link between defense company Fire Point, Zelensky's associate Mindich", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/money-man-for-mindich-energy-corruption-scheme-was-employed-by-flamingo-maker-fire-point/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Seven men charged after investigation into child sexual exploitation in Bristol", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/seven-men-charged-with-more-than-40-offences-as-police-investigate-child-sexual-exploitation-in-bristol-13468915", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Everything you need to know about Thailand\u2019s strict new alcohol rules", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/thailand-alcohol-ban-drinking-fine-b2863488.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine\u2019s Dilemma as Pokrovsk Teeters: Save Lives or Keep Holding On", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/world/europe/ukraine-pokrovsk-russia-battle.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish president refuses to appoint 46 judges in escalation of rule-of-law dispute with government", "summary": "", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/12/polish-president-refuses-to-appoint-47-judges-in-escalation-of-rule-of-law-dispute-with-government/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "German industry sees its own competitiveness at a record low", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ifo.de/en/facts/2025-11-11/german-industry-sees-its-own-competitiveness-record-low", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Sudan President Salva Kiir sacks Vice-President Bol Mel", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceq0e7q7vl8o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kurdish PKK militants begin handing over weapons in northern Iraq", "summary": "", "link": "https://thearabweekly.com/kurdish-pkk-militants-begin-handing-over-weapons-northern-iraq", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan\u2019s Army Chief Gets Expanded Powers and Lifelong Immunity", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/world/asia/pakistan-army-chief-power.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
