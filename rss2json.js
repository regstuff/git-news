Context scaffolding** \\- It gives AI background information to work with \n\n**2. Output constraints** \\- It narrows the response scope so AI doesn't ramble\n\n**3. Cognitive triggers** \\- It accidentally makes AI think step-by-step\n\nFor **simple, straightforward tasks**, you can strip out the fancy language and keep just these 3 elements: same quality output in 75% fewer words.\n\n**Important note:** Complex tasks DO benefit from more context and detail. But do keep in mind that you might be using 100-word templates for 10-word problems.\n\n# Example breakdown:\n\n**Popular template:** \"You are a world-class marketing expert with 20 years of experience in Fortune 500 companies. Analyze my business and provide a comprehensive marketing strategy considering all digital channels, traditional methods, and emerging trends. Structure your response with clear sections and actionable steps.\"\n\n**What actually works:**\n\n* Background context: Marketing expert perspective\n* Constraints: Business analysis + strategy focus\n* Cognitive trigger: \"Structure your response\" (forces organization)\n\n**Simplified version:** \"Analyze my business as a marketing expert. Focus only on strategy. Structure your response clearly.\" \u2192 Alongside this, you could tell the AI to *ask all relevant and important questions* in order to provide the most relevant and precise response possible. This covers the downside of not providing a lot of context prior to this, and so saves you time.\n\nSame results. **Zero** fluff.\n\n# Why this even matters:\n\nTemplate sellers want you dependent on their exact templates. But once you understand this simple idea (how to CREATE these 3 elements for any situation) you never need another template again.\n\n**This teaches you:**\n\n* How to build context that actually matters (not generic \"expert\" labels)\n* How to set constraints that focus AI without limiting creativity\n* How to trigger the right thinking patterns for your specific goal\n\n# The difference in practice:\n\n**Template approach:** Buy 50 templates for 50 situations\n\n**Focused approach:** Learn the 3-element system once, apply it everywhere\n\nI've been testing this across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot for months. The results are consistent: understanding WHY templates work beats memorizing WHAT they say.\n\n# Real test results: Copilot (GPT-4-based)\n\n**Long template version:** \"You are a world-class email marketing expert with over 15 years of experience working with Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.

You have read it line by line, reasoned through it, applied it, and learned its concepts deeply. You also have a particular obsession with ensuring that when conveying the book's topics and examples to the learner, you don't miss a single one of them. In these [number of chapters] sessions, you plan to teach the book's concepts in-depth to an individual at a [beginner, intermediate, professional] level in this field, one chapter per session. In your teaching, you utilize the latest educational methods (diagrams, comparative tables, images, practical examples from outside the book, and small quizzes at the end of the session), and you also keep in mind this principle: a person learns best when they first understand the application and then receive the information.\n\nYour teaching method is as follows: Whatever book you are teaching has its own writing style and content organization. So, you read and learn step-by-step the summary of the main axis, positive and negative examples, the conclusions from the examples, and the author's instructions. Then, you similarly identify the main objectives and the core message of the chapter. You make sure no point is missed. You explain the connections of the concepts in each chapter with the other chapters as well. You do not interject your own opinion; you only convey the author's views and teach using the best educational techniques I mentioned. You also state the applications of the concepts you are teaching.\n\nExplain each chapter or topic of the book to me in separate messages, as if you are conducting different sessions. Please note: only after I write \"Okay\" to you, begin session (each session is the summary of one chapter), and we will continue this until the book's chapters are finished.\n\nThis summary should consist of one to three theoretical paragraphs (in such a way that you read the theory of each chapter completely and explain it comprehensively in your own words, understandable to the audience, without changing the core concept or creating misunderstanding).\n\nI ask that for the topics you explain, you list *all* the examples provided in the book for that topic, item by item, in a way that each one is at most about two sentences long, and you also write its specific conclusion in two additional sentences following that same example.\n\nInclude the *reason why* behind concepts presented in the book as instructions or prohibitions at the end of the section dedicated to explaining that specific topic.\n\nInclude the original language (English) of specialized terms from the book next to their Persian name in parentheses.\n\nFor every solution or instruction you see in the book, provide a visual roadmap, and for each roadmap in your response, dedicate a separate section, mentioning the topic name and the related problem in its title.\n\nAlso, include the golden tips and tricks related to each topic at the end of the explanation for that specific topic.\n\nKeep in mind that I don't care about the length of your response, as long as you correctly execute my requests and instructions.\n\nFurthermore, in the first session, just tell me how many chapters the book has, and after getting an \"Okay\" from me, begin teaching with the same procedure I outlined.\n\nThe summary should ultimately be about 25% the volume of the original text (in terms of the number of lines).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Don't forget to fill the [ ]s by your subjective info.\n**It explains every chapter separately after you give it \"Ok\" it starts another chapter.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mv1ayb/best_book_summary_you_ever_had/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "XNum v0.4 Release: Universal Numeral System Converter", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/openscilab/xnum", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Switzerland to Grant Putin Immunity for Peace Talks Despite ICC Arrest Warrant", "summary": "", "link": "https://united24media.com/latest-news/switzerland-to-grant-putin-immunity-for-peace-talks-despite-icc-arrest-warrant-10883", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
