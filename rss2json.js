Ollama models  \n\\- In Windows Control Panel, type Environment, then select Edit environment variables for your account  \n\\- Click New button  \n\\- Set Variable Name to OLLAMA\\_MODELS  \n\\- Set Variable Value to C:\\\\Apps\\\\ollama\\\\models\n\n4. **uv**  \na. uv binary  \n\\- Default path is C:\\\\Users\\\\\\[user name\\]\\\\.local\\\\bin  \n\\- To change during installation, use this command:  \npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c {$env:UV\\_INSTALL\\_DIR = \"C:\\\\Apps\\\\uv\\\\bin\";irm  | iex}\n\nb. uv cache  \n\\- Default path is C:\\\\Users\\\\\\[user name\\]\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\uv\\\\cache  \n\\- To change the path, create a new Environment variable for the account:  \nVariable Name: UV\\_CACHE\\_DIR  \nVariable Value: C:\\\\Apps\\\\uv\\\\cache\n\n5. **Open WebUI**  \n\\- To specify the path, use the DATA\\_DIR parameter in the command:  \n$env:DATA\\_DIR=\"C:\\\\Apps\\\\open-webui\\\\data\"; uvx --python 3.11 open-webui@latest serve", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1l08fhl/quick_reference_configure_ollama_open_webui/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenAI Compatible API", "summary": "Why does OpenWebUI not support a \"Compatible\" to OpenAI API like everyone else?!\n\nI tried to connect Chatbox iOS app into OWUI directly, and it doesn't work because OWUI only supports /api/chat/completions, instead of the standard /v1/chat/completions.\n\n  \nAny workaround for this?
