If convicted, she could face up to eight years in prison.\n\nSince 2021, the\u00a0[Belarusian authorities have encouraged and assisted](\u00a0tens of thousands of migrants \u2013 mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa \u2013 to cross illegally into Poland. While most attempts are foiled, those who do make it across then often head onwards to Germany.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Polish border guard revealed that, as part of an investigation being overseen by the military affairs department of the Warsaw district prosecutor\u2019s office, they searched the residence of an unnamed Polish woman who had been involved in providing aid to migrants at the border.\n\nThey discovered 62 temporary foreigner identity certificates, which are issued to people who have applied for asylum in Poland, entitling them to remain in the country while their claim is processed.\n\nWhile their applications are considered, asylum seekers are not allowed to leave the country. However, the border guard notes that, among the 62 individuals who received those certificates, most had their asylum proceedings discontinued because they had left Poland.\n\nNow, the woman in whose home the documents were found has been charged with helping at least 15 foreigners illegally cross the border from Poland to Germany, a crime punishable by between six months and eight years in prison. She has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe woman\u2019s actions, which took place in 2022, \u201cexceeded the limits of aid\u201d, wrote the border guard, who also noted\u00a0that this case is \u201cfurther evidence of the instrumentalisation of the procedure for granting international protection on the territory of Poland\u201d.\u00a0\n\nThe Polish authorities have long argued that the asylum system is being abused by those caught crossing from Belarus, who apply for protection but then travel onwards to Germany illegally.\n\nPoland and the European Union\u00a0[regard the migration crisis](\u00a0orchestrated by Belarus as part of a Minsk and Moscow\u2019s \u201chybrid war\u201d intended to undermine stability in the EU.\n\nThe situation has prompted Germany to\u00a0[reintroduce border controls](\u00a0with Poland in 2023.

Instead, they are sent back over the border.\n\nMany activist groups have also sought to provide assistance to migrants who cross irregularly from Belarus. They argue that the situation is a humanitarian crisis, not a security one, and note that\u00a0[dozens of migrants have died]( often from cold conditions or\u00a0[drowning in the rivers](\u00a0along the border.\n\nBut some of those activists have been\u00a0[charged with violating migration laws]( In one widely publicised case, last September a group of five people were\u00a0[found not guilty](\u00a0of enabling the illegal presence in Poland of Middle Eastern migrants whom they provided humanitarian aid to after they had crossed the border.\n\nThe ruling was celebrated \u201cas a great victory for justice\u201d by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR), which said \u201cit shows that, contrary to politicians\u2019 narratives, humanitarian aid is and will remain legal\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/14/polish-woman-who-helped-migrants-at-belarus-border-charged-with-aiding-their-illegal-entry-to-germany/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran protests: Authorities demanding large sums for return of protesters' bodies, BBC told.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5md1n1yxo.amp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran protests: Authorities demanding large sums for return of protesters' bodies, BBC told", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g5md1n1yxo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Taliban rift at the top of the leadership in Afghanistan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg7vdpy1l2vo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Junior Polish ruling party invalidates leadership election amid claims of \u201cexternal interference\u201d", "summary": "The centrist Poland 2050 party, a junior partner in the ruling coalition, has invalidated the results of its leadership election after technical problems disrupted online voting, with officials saying there had been attempts at \u201cexternal interference\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the party\u2019s current leader, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, who was meant to be stepping down once a successor was chosen in the election, has now said that he does not rule out reversing course and standing in a newly called leadership election.\n\nPoland 2050 is part of the coalition, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Civic Coalition (KO) party, that took power in December 2023. It has 31 of the coalition\u2019s 240 members of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament.\n\nIn September, the party\u2019s founder and leader, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia,\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that he would step down when his term ended in January. That prompted a contest to choose his successor.\n\nIn a first-round vote, held on Saturday, none of the five candidates won a majority of votes, meaning that the two most popular \u2013 Katarzyna Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz, the minister for funds and regional policy, and climate minister Paulina Hennig-Kloska \u2013 stood in a run-off election on Monday.\n\nThe results were due to be announced at 10 p.m. But, after a delay, the party revealed that the election had been invalidated because of technical issues with the online voting system.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the voting system stopped working and some politicians received links that did not work,\u201d Ignacy Niemczycki, a deputy foreign minister from Poland 2050, told broadcaster RMF.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a system error, but we don\u2019t rule out external interference or a hacker attack,\u201d one of the party\u2019s MPs, Kamil Wnuk, told the\u00a0*Wprost*\u00a0newspaper.\n\nThat was then confirmed by Ho\u0142ownia himself, who said that \u201ceverything indicates there was an external attempt to disrupt our electoral process\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver 20,000 attempts to access the system have been recorded,\u201d he added, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). \u201cThe company providing this service is investigating how this happened and who is behind it.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Polska (BIP) reports that the party used Interankiety, a commercial survey platform. BIP suggested that the administrators of the vote may not have enabled all of the necessary safeguards on the service to ensure the security of voting.\n\nBroadcaster TVN reported that problems had already emerged during the first round on Saturday, with some delegates unable to access the voting link. TVN\u2019s reporter, Micha\u0142 Go\u0142\u0119biowski, found that only 656 votes were cast out of more than 800 eligible delegates.\n\nRegarding what will happen next, Ho\u0142ownia today outlined two possible scenarios: a repeat of the second round of voting or a repeat of the entire election. He said the party\u2019s leadership would meet on Friday to decide how to proceed.\n\nAsked if he would now reverse his decision to step down and stand in the leadership election, if a new one is called, Ho\u0142ownia did not rule it out. \u201cIf it turns out that this is a solution that will help Poland in 2050, I will not shirk it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he announced in September that he would stand down as leader, Ho\u0142ownia also revealed that he was applying to become the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees. However, in December, Iraqi Barham Salih was chosen for the role, taking up the post on 1 January.\n\nThe confusion over Poland 2050\u2019s leadership election was met with mockery and disbelief by other politicians, including some partners in the ruling coalition.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you vote normally at the \\[party\\] convention/congress?

Over the last few months, the party has been polling around 2% support.\n\nIn the 2023 parliamentary elections, Poland 2050 stood jointly with the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL) under the name Third Way, winning 14.4% of the vote.\n\nHowever, they\u00a0[decided to split](\u00a0last year, while both remaining part of Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition.
