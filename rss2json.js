Here\u2019s How. \u2022 From voter intimidation to refusing to provide paper tallies to verify the result claimed by the government, the election was riddled with problems.", "summary": "Across the country citizens, local reporters and journalists for The New York Times observed instances of voter intimidation.\n\n###Voter intimidation\nIn the early morning about 15 men in unmarked black jackets temporarily blocked access to one voting center in the capital, Caracas, a Times journalist observed. One volunteer vote monitor was punched.\n\nIn the eastern city of Matur\u00edn, a woman was hit by a bullet when men on motorcycles drove by a line of people waiting to vote, according to a former lawmaker, Mar\u00eda Gabriela Hern\u00e1ndez, who was at the scene.\n\nAnd in another polling place in the northern city of Cuman\u00e1, roughly 50 armed police officers and national guardsmen formed a long line outside, wearing helmets and body armor, in what appeared to be a show of power to anyone considering voting against the government.\n\n###Changing some voting stations\nAbout 17,000 Venezuelans saw their voting stations changed at the last minute according to Carlos Medina, who helps direct the Venezuelan Electoral Observatory, an independent group.\n\n###Keeping other polling places open late\nSome stations stayed open beyond the scheduled end of the vote, giving members of Mr. Maduro\u2019s party a chance to round up voters who had yet to cast their ballots.\n\n###Withholding paper tallies\nThere are two vote counts in Venezuela, a digital tally received by the country\u2019s election authority \u2014 which is led by an ally of Mr. Maduro \u2014 and a paper count printed by each voting machine at polling places.\n\nThe opposition invested heavily in an effort to have supporters present at each voting station to obtain a physical printout of the voting tally from every voting machine after the polls closed.\n\nThat access is required by Venezuelan election law, and the paper counts are typically the way that everyday citizens can verify that the digital count is correct.\n\nBut officials at some polling places refused to release the printouts to election monitors.\n\nThis was the case at one of the largest voting stations in Caracas, the Rafael Napoleon Baute school in Petare, where about 15,000 people were registered to vote.\n\nWithout all the paper counts, the country was left without a way to verify the result announced by the ruling party.\n\n###Not publishing a full vote count\nShortly after midnight early Monday morning the country\u2019s electoral authority announced that Mr. Maduro had received 51.2 percent of the vote, while the main opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had received 44.2 percent, with 80 percent of voting stations counted.\n\nBut the government did not release a full vote count, and its figures did not appear to match statistical estimates based on partial counts gathered by opposition poll watchers and other data that showed the president losing by a wide margin. As of Wednesday, the government had still not provided a full vote count.\n\n[Full copy of the article](", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-election-vote-flaws.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "U.S. women earn first rugby sevens medal on Alex Sedrick\u2019s long try as time expires", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/us-women-earn-first-rugby-sevens-medal-alex-sedricks-long-try-time-exp-rcna164328", "author": "None"}, {"title": "So i made a machine learning library in rust a few months back while trying to study machine learning [very unoptimized", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Chigo042823/Sprout", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The United States Still Needs an Indian States Strategy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-states-still-needs-indian-states-strategy", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Reliance Gets US Approval to Resume Crude Imports from Venezuela", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-24/reliance-gets-us-approval-to-resume-crude-imports-from-venezuela?srnd=india-v2", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Four takeaways from a thrilling night of Olympic swimming", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Four takeaways from a thrilling night of Olympic swimming</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPMS1LdXFaQUx3YXFHQnpHbHMxSE1HTlBSUWJpYW1nTFJzVHhzZERlSFNPY0ZINVNETm51a1Y2cnd2MEdWQU0xMUZPVEczTjNhLVJyWmR0clV6Vm5namdKVDlVOXl1SmxsU2ZLakpsd0RZWE1CckpEV0N2b2xJRS1MazJyMnJDS1lyRC12YThvazdCREdGUzhWTVFVUQ?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-31", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The latest on the Paris Olympics", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">The latest on the Paris Olympics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNOF9mYWNHaXZDOHYyZnJUSGk5SHVqa2hXYjVFZkZmbGlhbVVYWjMtMDNwSTFQQTRESDNraDhvNnlNRFhvLUw0NDg1bkg3WUVTMVcycXZ2THZ3X09UNFZ3akJsSW9OcWZGVUpLc1k1cXUwN19EWXVHZWVQeGdvOV9IYkVPdXVwdWlFNTFHNA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-01", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US women\u2019s soccer team qualifies for Olympic quarterfinals as group winner after 2-1 victory over Australia", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">US women\u2019s soccer team qualifies for Olympic quarterfinals as group winner after 2-1 victory over Australia</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOMkxjenJmWU51aWhmeklNbFEyWmtQZ1VaaXFOamlmNlQyQWlaY1pvdkVqdGxEakRHU1RyN2NrTExVWGw5bm91Q3U3T0ZWbFd0aVB4cGxZbjYzcmtOVG5hMklTUGlMX1lhSmowdjdhaGtNYl9fem0zTDc5NzVkTWtqYUxCOEhXY2lvUWtpdjRvODMxUGg4T0E?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-31", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jos\u00e9 Torres Gil makes BMX history for Argentina during \u2018best final ever\u2019 at Paris Olympics", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Jos\u00e9 Torres Gil makes BMX history for Argentina during \u2018best final ever\u2019 at Paris Olympics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPUE9jWllvYkFwdnJKeV9TMTk2R05yOHBocWZ4d2RqWjF3dVRvWjRMWGJaSVBQU1E3Y0JzRS1hbk44bG1xVzFnUnJQZnR5M2tSb0NxbHRLaVpFZHhLRGhSM2oyQzd0OVJxWVgyVW1MdjFWLUJzSkwyR3piVHpjODJoUE9SQ2RwWUhpLVhMSzFiVGs0dG5pZ0lQQnpqMA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-31", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Team USA women\u2019s basketball squad emphasizes endorsement of Kamala Harris for president", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Team USA women\u2019s basketball squad emphasizes endorsement of Kamala Harris for president</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQcFQxaEVBS2hXc19UcXFpcDYyWFEzeVZpUFY1aHZzMHJWVzNYTjNRWDhxOVF3Slg1S3pkNnRhRjVwQjlxSGFOc0Fmczgzdi15X0kxSEw4YVl0SkdwWXpwVW5sd0ZWWkY1a2FVRXloWUxKNU5xUTZqc0Y2TENlSVNQdWZOcFE4bmxMTUU3ajhpc24tXzFFT3V2b2xfNVZoOTRMQkV4YjRrTXpoaGVzUEHSAZ8BQVVfeXFMTnBYd3hTZkRtRENSSnNVZ3lZUkFBc1locXhFeVdmXzRTYjRIclF4cUtERGZJMGNtRXB3RHJxTUtJYy1lRzZZWGZkaFNiWG9kdU5zd3Q4c25VbWdXVmp2SmdoU01XU2lpY0RXdmtWQVNVUGZ2U25Qa0R6SHF6QXVJdnpwN2pEeV9BcGJkWE5CUE8zR0h5RmVGZXFMZm9Ibm9Z?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-31", "author": "None"}]}}};
