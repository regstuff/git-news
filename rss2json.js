Automating such insurance documents is truly a challenge. One reason is the comparatively limited number of documents available in non-English languages to train automation platforms such as RPA, OCR, and IDP. Due to this, most document automation vendors don\u2019t provide multilingual support. One approach is to replicate different variations of the available documents and use that data to train the systems for better results. However, for such use cases, a significant amount of manual effort is involved in the process, as it requires a trial-and-error approach, correcting each mistake the system makes until it is properly trained. Consequently, the number of vendors offering multilingual support for documents is quite limited.\u00a0\n\n  \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1imwqvu/how_do_you_handle_limited_data_sets_when/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mycenaean bronze daggers, inlaid with gold and silver.
