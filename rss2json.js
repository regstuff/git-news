I used one **German** and one **US English** model and generated around **10,000 examples**.\n\n# Additional Audio for Augmentation\n\nBecause OWW also requires extra audio files for augmentation, I downloaded the following datasets:\n\n1. **Impulse Responses (RIRS)** datasets.load_dataset(\"davidscripka/MIT_environmental_impulse_responses\")\n2. **Background Noise Dataset** [ (\\~16k files)\n3. **FMA Dataset (Large)**\n4. **OpenWakeWord Features (ACAV100M)** For training (\\~2,000 hours):wget [  For validation (\\~11 hours):wget [\n\n# Training Configuration\n\nHere are the parameters I used:\n\n    augmentation_batch_size: 16 \n    augmentation_rounds: 2\n    background_paths_duplication_rate:\n    - 1\n    batch_n_per_class:\n      ACAV100M_sample: 1024  \n      adversarial_negative: 70   \n      positive: 70        \n    custom_negative_phrases: []\n    layer_size: 32\n    max_negative_weight: 2000\n    model_name: hey_xyz\n    model_type: dnn\n    n_samples: 10000\n    n_samples_val: 2000 \n    steps: 50000\n    target_accuracy: 0.8\n    target_false_positives_per_hour: 0.2\n    target_phrase:\n    - hey xyz\n    target_recall: 0.9 \n    tts_batch_size: 50\n\nWith the augmentation rounds, the 10k generated examples become **20k positive samples** and **4k validation files**.\n\nHowever, something seems odd:  \nThe file openwakeword_features_ACAV100M_2000_hrs_16bit.npy contains **\\~5.6 million negative features**. In comparison, my 20k positive examples are tiny. Is that expected?\n\nI also adjusted the batch_n_per_class values to:\n\n    ACAV100M_sample: 1024  \n    adversarial_negative: 70   \n    positive: 70\n\n\u2026to try to keep the ratio somewhat balanced \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right approach.\n\nAnother thing that confuses me is the documentation note that the \u201chey Jarvis\u201d model was trained with **30,000 hours** of negative examples. I only have about **2,000 hours**. Do you know which datasets were used there, and how many steps were involved in that training?\n\n# Training Results\n\nRegarding the training in general \u2014 do you have any recommendations on how to improve the process? I had the impression that increasing the number of steps actually made results worse. Here are two examples:\n\n**Run 1:**\n\n* 20,000 positive, 4,000 positive test\n* max_negative_weight = 1500\n* 50,000 steps\n\n\n\n    Final Accuracy: 0.859125018119812\n    Final Recall: 0.721750020980835\n    False Positives per Hour: 4.336283206939697\n\n**Run 2:**\n\n* 20,000 positive, 4,000 positive test\n* max_negative_weight = 2000\n* 50,000 steps\n\n\n\n    Final Accuracy: 0.8373749852180481\n    Final Recall: 0.6790000200271606\n    False Positives per Hour: 1.8584070205688477\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019m not confident that this setup will get me to production-level performance, so any advice or insights from your experience would be very helpful.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1o5cjkz/openwakeword_training/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What GLM-4.6 fixes did Unsloth do?", "summary": "Hey guys, we didn't talk about what chat template fixes we did for GLM-4.6, but the most major one is when using GGUFs, the 2nd prompt doesn't work.

I really like the interface and overall experience so far \u2014 but I\u2019ve also run into a few challenges and questions.\n\n\n\n# 1. Agentic behavior vs. standard API\n\nWhen I use **Claude Desktop**, it seems to handle quite complex system prompts.  \nFor example, if I ask it to *research a company* \u2014 get basic info, LinkedIn profile, geo coordinates, etc. \u2014 Claude goes into an \u201cagentic loop\u201d and sequentially performs multiple searches or steps to gather everything.\n\nHowever, when I use the **Sonnet 4.5 API** with web search in OpenWebUI, it only makes *one* search call and lists whatever it finds \u2014 it doesn\u2019t perform deeper, sequential web searches.\n\nI was considering trying the **Claude Agent SDK** to replicate that looping behavior, but I haven\u2019t found any examples or documentation on how to integrate it with OpenWebUI. Am I missing something here, or is nobody else doing this (which is usually a bad sign \ud83d\ude05)?\n\n\n\n# 2. Designing simple team workflows\n\nI want to make workflows easy for my team.  \nFor example: when a new customer needs to be added, they should just type in the company name, and the AI should automatically research all relevant info and push the structured dataset into our database through an API.\n\nHow would you organize something like this in OpenWebUI \u2014 via **folders**, **workspaces**, or some other setup?\n\n\n\n# 3. Pipes vs. Functions\n\nI\u2019m still a bit confused about the conceptual difference between **pipes** and **functions**.  \nCan someone explain how these are meant to be used differently?\n\n\n\n# 4. OpenRouter vs. Direct API integrations\n\nI\u2019m currently using **OpenRouter**, but I noticed there are also direct integrations for Anthropic and others.  \nWhat are the main pros and cons of using OpenRouter vs. the native API connections?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for any guidance or best practices you can share!\n\n\u2014 *Laurenz*", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1o53n6i/open_webui_and_agentic_loops/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dozens killed in Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes, border closed", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistan-claims-58-pakistani-soldiers-killed-clashes-border-closed-2025-10-12/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Inscribe: Markdown preprocessor that runs code fences", "summary": "-   **Execute Code Fences:** Run code from various languages directly within your markdown.\n-   **Multi-Language Support:** Built-in runners for Python, JavaScript/Node, Ruby, Shell (bash, sh), and more.\n-   **Customizable Runners:** Easily define custom commands for any language (e.g., use python3.11 instead of python).\n-   **Inline Code Execution:** Run and replace short, inline code snippets for dynamic text.\n-   **File Watching:** Automatically reprocess your document whenever the source file changes for a seamless workflow.\n-   **Post-Processing Hooks:** Run any command (like a static site generator or pandoc) after a file is successfully processed.\n-   **Standard I/O:** Works seamlessly with stdin and stdout for easy integration into Unix pipelines.\n-   **Stateful Execution:** Code blocks of the same language share a single runtime session, allowing variables and state to persist from one block to the next.", "link": "https://github.com/tesserato/Inscribe", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Planet\u2019s first catastrophic climate tipping point reached, report says, with coral reefs facing \u2018widespread dieback\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/13/coral-reefs-ice-sheets-amazon-rainforest-tipping-point-global-heating-scientists-report", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel says first hostages handed over as Palestinian prisoners also expected to be released", "summary": "The comments that said that Hamas will break the deal didn't age well lmao ", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/israel-says-first-seven-hostages-handed-to-red-cross-13448949", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What started with her babysitting money has now changed thousands of lives in Nepal", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/world/nepal-blinknow-maggie-doyne-cnnheroes-update", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Palestinian journalist Saleh Aljafarawi shot dead in Gaza City clashes", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/12/palestinian-journalist-saleh-aljafarawi-shot-dead-in-gaza-city-clashes", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New RNA tool to advance cancer and infectious disease research and treatment", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-rna-tool-advance-cancer-infectious-disease-research-treatment-0911", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trouble Understanding Knowledge", "summary": "I can get the Knowledge feature to work reasonably well if I add just one file.\n\nMy use case, however, is that I have a directory with thousands of (small) files.
