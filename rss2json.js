Both Orb\u00e1n and Nawrocki are also close to Donald Trump. But they hold very different positions towards Russia.\n\nThe Polish president was due to visit Hungary on 3-4 December, attending a summit of presidents of the Visegrad Group \u2013 which consists of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic \u2013 in Esztergom on Wednesday, followed by a meeting with Orb\u00e1n in Budapest on Thursday.\n\nHowever, today, the head of the president\u2019s foreign policy office, Marcin Przydacz, confirmed that Nawrocki would now only attend the Wednesday summit.\n\n\u201cIn connection with the visit to Moscow carried out by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and its context, President Nawrocki decided to limit the program of his visit to Hungary exclusively to the summit of the presidents of the Visegr\u00e1d Group in Esztergom,\u201d wrote Przydacz.\n\n\u201cPresident Nawrocki consistently advocates for seeking ways to end the war in Ukraine caused by Russia,\u201d added Przydacz, but also believes \u201cthat Europe\u2019s security depends on solidarity, including in the field of energy\u201d.\n\nLater, speaking to broadcaster TVN, Nawrocki\u2019s spokesman, Rafa\u0142 Le\u015bkiewicz, said that, \u201cin view of what happened on Friday \u2013 the meeting between Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n and the criminal Putin \u2013 it is obvious that the president has cancelled this visit and will not meet with Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n\u201d.\u00a0\n\nOn Friday, Orb\u00e1n travelled to Moscow, where he met with Putin. Afterwards, the Hungarian prime minister said he had secured supplies of Russian oil and gas, and had also reiterated Budapest\u2019s offer to host peace talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States.\n\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s visit was criticised by other EU leaders, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz saying that the Hungarian prime minister was \u201cacting without a European mandate and he is doing so without consulting us\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s government \u2013 a broad, pro-EU coalition ranging from left to centre right \u2013 has also regularly clashed with Orb\u00e1n, both\u00a0[over his close ties with Russia](\u00a0and also his decision to offer refuge to PiS politicians fleeing justice in Poland.\n\nLast year, Hungary\u00a0[granted asylum](\u00a0to a former PiS government minister who was facing criminal charges in Poland, prompting Warsaw to\u00a0[withdraw its ambassador]( This month, former PiS justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro\u00a0[took refuge in Budapest](\u00a0amid efforts to bring charges against him in Poland.\n\nWhile Nawrocki and PiS are aligned with Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party on many issues, the two sides differ markedly on the question of Russia. Nawrocki and PiS regard Moscow as a perennial and major threat to Poland and Europe.\n\nThose differences\u00a0[led to a break](\u00a0between PiS and Fidesz following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
