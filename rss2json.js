The site had reportedly been dug up a few years ago before work was stalled.\n\nMehta, who didn't know how to swim, climbed on to the roof of his car as it began to sink and rang his father who rushed to the scene and alerted the emergency services. His father told reporters that Mehta remained there for close to two hours, flashing the torch on his phone and shouting for help.\n\nThen, his cries stopped. By the time authorities recovered his body, almost five hours had passed since the accident, local media reported.\n\nMehta's tragic death has made national headlines, and the fact that it happened so close to the capital city has shocked and angered residents. Protests have been held at the accident site, with demonstrators accusing authorities of negligence and demanding accountability.\n\nHis death has also fuelled larger questions about the state of Indian roads and urban planning.\n\n\"Noida techie's \\[Mehta's\\] death is essentially a murder. Dreams shattered. Hard work gone in vain. Father's hopes buried. All because of a failed system,\" one user wrote on X.\n\n\"This tragedy raises deeper questions about the quality of infrastructure in even big cities like Noida,\" said another.\n\nSome users shared their own experiences of accidents because of bad roads, lack of adequate signage and poor lighting after dark. Some also complained about open drains and construction sites on roads close to their homes becoming death traps, especially for children and the elderly.\n\nSince the accident, police in Noida have registered two cases against the real estate developers of the construction site where the pit was located following a complaint from Mehta's family.\n\nOn Sunday, the government of Uttar Pradesh state, where Noida is located, removed a senior official from the township's governing authority and ordered an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the rescue operation and site safety.\n\nSince then, police have arrested Abhay Kumar, one of the owners of the construction site, for alleged culpable homicide due to negligence under India's criminal code. Kumar is in custody and has not commented on the allegations.\n\nPolice have said that further investigations are under way and that more arrests are likely in the coming days.\n\nIn media interviews, Mehta's father Rajkumar has said that he received a call from his son soon after the accident happened. He rushed to the spot but said that the site was pitch dark and shrouded in fog, and that his son was barely visible in the murky waters.\n\nHe alerted the police and the fire brigade and said that rescue teams arrived at the site shortly after. But he alleged that his son remained stranded for hours because they did not have the resources to pull him out.\n\nHe added that his son's life could have been saved if trained divers were sent to retrieve him, but that did not happen.\n\n\"He was constantly saying, 'Papa mujhe bacha lo' \\[Papa save me\\] during his last hours,\" Rajkumar Mehta told NDTV news channel.\n\nMoninder, who goes by one name and is a delivery worker for an e-commerce platform, was passing by and reportedly made a brave attempt to save Mehta. He tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the freezing water to pull him out, he told Hindustan Times newspaper..\n\nHe added that he searched for Mehta for 30-40 minutes but couldn't locate him. He also alleged that emergency responders weren't willing to step inside the water, saying that it [was too cold and that there were iron rods]( inside the pit.\n\nNoida's additional commissioner of police Rajeev Narain Mishra told the media that the incident was \"unfortunate\" but denied negligence.\n\n\"Police and fire department teams made efforts to save the youth. A fire department crane, ladder, makeshift boat and searchlights were used, but there was zero visibility at the time,\" he told Times of India newspaper and added that further investigation was under way.\n\nHemant Upadhyay, assistant commissioner of police for Noida, told British newspaper The Independent that no-one was sent into the pit because officers were concerned about further casualties if untrained personnel were sent in.\n\n\"The water was very deep, visibility was poor and there were concerns about submerged debris,\" he said.", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620l5e2q1vo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "3 journalists killed in Israeli airstrike in Gaza, including cameraman who worked with CBS News", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/journalists-killed-in-gaza-cameraman-cbs-news/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US military assets heading to Middle East even as Trump backs off toughest Iran rhetoric", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-assets-heading-middle-east-even-trump-backs-off-toughest-iran-2026-01-22/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel postpones demolition of Palestinian children's football pitch in Bethlehem", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3dm37m7no", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Controversial Swiss Suicide Pod Gets an AI-Powered Mental Fitness Upgrade", "summary": "&gt;There have been many high-profile stories in which chatbots have effectively encouraged and enabled people experiencing mental health crises to kill themselves, which has resulted in several wrongful death lawsuits against the companies responsible for the AI models behind the bots. Now we\u2019ve got the inverse: if you want to use your right to die, you have to convince an AI that you are mentally capable of making such a decision.\n\n&gt;According to Futurism, the creator of a controversial assisted-suicide device known as the Sarco has introduced a psychiatric test administered by AI to determine if a person is of sound enough mind to decide to end their life. If they are deemed of sound mind by the AI, the suicide pod will be powered on, and they will have up to 24 hours to decide to move forward to their final destination. If they miss the window, they\u2019ll have to start over.\n\n&gt;The Sarco that is central to this whole thing has already stirred up quite a bit of controversy before introducing the AI mental fitness test. Named after the sarcophagus by inventor Philip Nitschke, the Sarco was built in 2019 and used for the first time in 2024 when a 64-year-old American woman who had been suffering from complications associated with a severely compromised immune system, underwent the process of self-administered euthanasia in Switzerland, where assisted suicide is technically legal. She reportedly underwent a traditional psychiatric evaluation conducted by a Dutch psychiatrist before she pressed a button that released nitrogen within the capsule and ended her life because the AI assessment wasn\u2019t ready at the time.\n\n&gt;However, the use of the Sarco resulted in the arrest of Dr. Florian Willet, a pro-assisted suicide advocate who was present for the woman\u2019s death. Swiss law enforcement arrested the doctor on the grounds of aiding and abetting a suicide. Under the country\u2019s laws, assisted suicide is allowed as long as the person takes their own life with no \u201cexternal assistance,\u201d and those who help the person die must not do so for \u201cany self-serving motive.\u201d Dr. Willet would later die by assisted suicide in Germany in 2025, reportedly in part due to the psychological trauma he experienced following his arrest and detention.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s unclear if Willet was evaluated using the new AI assessment, but Nitschke will apparently include the new test in his latest version of the Sarco that he designed for couples, according to the Daily Mail. The \u201cDouble Dutch\u201d model will evaluate both partners and allow them to enter a conjoined pod so they can pass on to the next life while lying next to each other.\n\n&gt;The whole thing does raise a question, though: why do you need AI for this? They were able to find a psychiatrist for the one use of the pod thus far, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re doing this at such a volume that they need to pass the assessment off to AI to expedite the process. Whatever your stance on assisted suicide may be, the inclusion of an AI test over a human assessment feels like it undermines the dignity of choosing to die. A person at the end of their life deserves to be taken seriously and receive human consideration, not pass a CAPTCHA.", "link": "https://gizmodo.com/controversial-swiss-suicide-pod-gets-an-ai-powered-mental-fitness-upgrade-2000712092", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland to increase gold reserve to world\u2019s 10th largest", "summary": "Poland is set to become the world\u2019s tenth biggest holder of gold after its central bank, the National Bank of Poland (NBP), announced plans to increase its reserves to 700 tonnes.\n\nThe NBP currently holds 550 tonnes of gold, the 12th largest reserve among the world\u2019s central banks. However, increasing that to 700 tonnes would, on current figures, move it ahead of the Netherlands (612.5 tonnes) and Turkey (641.3 tonnes).\n\n\u201cThis will place Poland among the elite ten countries with the largest gold reserves in the world,\u201d declared NBP governor Adam Glapi\u0144ski in a press release on Tuesday announcing the plan to increase reserves to 700 tonnes.\n\nPoland has been accelerating its gold accumulation in recent years. In 1996, the NBP held just 14 tonnes of gold. By 2016, the year Glapi\u0144ski became the bank\u2019s governor, that had risen to 102 tonnes. In the decade since then, the figure has grown more than fivefold.\n\nAccording to\u00a0[data](\u00a0from the World Gold Council, an international trade association for the gold industry, in the first 11 months of last year, the NBP added more gold to its reserves (95 tonnes) than any other central bank globally.\n\nIn May last year, NBP\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that for the first time its gold reserves were larger than those of the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nLast week, Glapi\u0144ski had already signalled plans to increase the NBP\u2019s gold reserves. He emphasised that gold is a strategic asset for the state\u2019s security and said that selling it is \u201cabsolutely out of the question\u201d, reported broadcaster TVN24.\n\nGlapi\u0144ski also warned that the rapid rise in gold prices will not last indefinitely and that a significant correction is possible. Regardless, he said, the central bank will continue accumulating reserves to ensure the country\u2019s financial security in \u201cexceptionally volatile times.\u201d\n\nAccording to Glapi\u0144ski, the 550 tonnes of gold currently held by the bank are worth nearly 276 billion zloty (\u20ac65.3 billion). That meant that the metal accounted for around 28% of the value of the NBP\u2019s total reserves at the end of 2025.\n\nLast year, following decades of rapid growth, Poland\u2019s GDP surpassed $1 trillion, thereby overtaking Switzerland to become\u00a0[the 20th largest national economy in the world](", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/20/poland-to-increase-gold-reserve-to-worlds-10th-largest/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian couple accused of being Kremlin spies go on trial in Poland", "summary": "A Russian married couple accused of being spies have gone on trial in Poland.
