Nevertheless, explanations of how such  fine-tuning influences the internal computations in these models remain  elusive. We study how fine-tuning affects the internal mechanisms  implemented in language models. As a case study, we explore the property  of entity tracking, a crucial facet of language comprehension, where  models fine-tuned on mathematics have substantial performance gains. We  identify the mechanism that enables entity tracking and show that (i) in  both the original model and its fine-tuned versions primarily the same  circuit implements entity tracking. In fact, the entity tracking circuit  of the original model on the fine-tuned versions performs better than  the full original model. (ii) The circuits of all the models implement  roughly the same functionality: Entity tracking is performed by tracking  the position of the correct entity in both the original model and its  fine-tuned versions. (iii) Performance boost in the fine-tuned models is  primarily attributed to its improved ability to handle the augmented  positional information. To uncover these findings, we employ: Patch  Patching, DCM, which automatically detects model components responsible  for specific semantics, and **CMAP**, a new approach for patching  activations across models to reveal improved mechanisms. Our findings  suggest that fine-tuning enhances, rather than fundamentally alters, the  mechanistic operation of the model.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1c599uw/finetuning_enhances_existing_mechanisms_a_case/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open Interface - Control Any Computer Using LLMs", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/0lnewh88xnuc1.gif", "author": "None"}, {"title": "To avoid AI-driven \"knowledge collapse\", humans must actively preserve specialized expertise", "summary": "\ud83d\udc49 Andrew J. Peterson, an AI researcher from the University of Poitiers, warns that overreliance on AI-generated content from large language models (LLMs) could lead to a phenomenon he terms \"knowledge collapse\" - a progressive narrowing of available information and perceived value in seeking out diverse knowledge.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 Peterson argues that while LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data, they tend to generate outputs clustered around the most common perspectives. Widespread use of AI systems to access information could lead to the neglect of rare, specialized, and unorthodox ideas in favor of an increasingly narrow set of popular viewpoints.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 Peterson's model shows that if AI-generated content becomes cheap enough relative to traditional methods, or if AI systems become recursively dependent on other AI-generated data, public knowledge may degenerate significantly over time. To counteract this, he recommends safeguards to prevent total reliance on AI-generated information and ensuring humans continue to invest in preserving specialized knowledge.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1c4oxs8/to_avoid_aidriven_knowledge_collapse_humans_must/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AP7AM: TMC MP targets Indian Ambassador to Cambodia for playing 'fancy dress'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ap7am.com/en/78861/tmc-mp-targets-indian-ambassador-to-cambodia-for-playing-fancy-dress", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The engineered dilemma", "summary": "Mr. Israel Katz is foreign minister of Israel.
