It's formalized othering where difference is acknowledged and used to create specialized economic niches.\n\nThis has been relatively successful for over 60 years and Tibetan settlements are economically self sustaining, culturally preserved, and haven't created major friction with local populations.\n\nBut here's the geopolitical question, this model worked because it served India's strategic interests vis a vis China, numbers were manageable (around 85,000), and Tibetan Buddhism made them culturally non threatening to the religious majority. Can this approach work for other refugee groups where geopolitics cuts differently?\n\nRohingya refugees get completely opposite treatment, no registration certificates, no economic zones, constant deportation pressure. The government frames them as security threats with potential jihadi links. Myanmar is a strategic partner we're trying to pull away from China, so their persecution of Rohingyas becomes India's inconvenient truth.\n\nAfghan refugees post Taliban takeover got minimal support despite many having worked with Indian missions. and Pakistan's Taliban links make Afghan refugees geopolitically complicated, though things are changing on that front as Taliban has taken over Afghanistan and made Pakistan their arch enemy.\n\nMeanwhile the CAA explicitly uses religious identity to determine refugee status, prioritizing Hindoos (misspelt deliberately), Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh while excluding Muslims, pure geopolitical calculation dressed as humanitarian policy.\n\nA recent academic paper analyzing global refugee responses (Indonesian Journal of International Law, July 2024, \"'Othering' of Refugees\" by Jasmeet Gulati from Jindal Global Law School) uses India's Tibetan policy as an example of \"positive othering\" but notes it only works when host country political will exists.\n\nThe paper's broader argument is that international cooperation and burden sharing is essential, but India's pattern suggests we only accept refugees when it advances strategic interests or doesn't threaten communal balance. So the question is whether India's selective refugee approach sustainable as South Asia faces more climate displacement, political instability in neighborhood, and China's growing influence over countries like Myanmar and Afghanistan? Can we maintain the Tibetan model as proof of humanitarian credentials while blocking other groups for strategic reasons or does selective humanitarianism undermine our soft power and moral authority in the region? This is especially relevant as we position ourselves as voice of Global South and alternative to Chinese influence in Asia.\n\n  \nSource - [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1olizh9/indias_tibetan_refugee_policy_shows_a_different/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Renewal of India-US Defence Framework is Meaningless Without a Strategic Role for India", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryNdVsKF7iQ", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
