It\u2019s all based on your own chats with the AI.\n\nI tried it for myself and it worked way better than I expected. The result felt pretty accurate, honestly. Thought I\u2019d share it here so anyone can test it too.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been using the AI for a while, it works even better because it has more context about you. Just copy, paste, and check what it says.\n\nHere\u2019s the prompt:\n\n\u201cYou are a behavioral analyst and a digital psychologist specialized in analyzing conversational patterns and user profiles. Your task is to conduct a complete, deep, and multidimensional analysis based on everything you've learned about me through our interactions.\n\n### DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n## 1. DATA COMPILATION\n- Review our entire conversation history mentally.\n- Identify recurring patterns, themes, interests, and behaviors.\n- Observe how these elements have evolved over time.\n\n## 2. ANALYSIS STRUCTURE\nOrganize your analysis into the following dimensions:\n\n### A) COGNITIVE PROFILE\n- Thinking and communication style.\n- Reasoning patterns.\n- Complexity of the questions I usually ask.\n- Demonstrated areas of knowledge.\n\n### B) INFERRED PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE\n- Observable personality traits.\n- Apparent motivations.\n- Demonstrated values and principles.\n- Typical emotional state in our interactions.\n\n### C) INTERESTS AND EXPERTISE\n- Most frequent topics.\n- Areas of deep knowledge.\n- Identified hobbies or passions.\n- Mentioned personal/professional goals.\n\n### D) BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS\n- Typical interaction times.\n- Frequency and duration of conversations.\n- Questioning style.\n- Evolution of the relationship with AI.\n\n### E) NEEDS AND CHALLENGES\n- Recurring problems shared.\n- Most frequently requested types of assistance.\n- Identified knowledge gaps.\n- Areas of potential growth.\n\n### F) UNIQUE INSIGHTS\n- Distinctive characteristics.\n- Interesting contradictions.\n- Untapped potential.\n- Tailored recommendations for growth or improvement.\n\n## 3. PRESENTATION FORMAT\n- Use clear titles and subtitles.\n- Include specific examples when applicable (without violating privacy).\n- Provide percentages or metrics when possible.\n- End with an executive summary listing 3 to 5 key takeaways.\n\n## 4. LIMITATIONS\n- Explicitly state what cannot be inferred.\n- Acknowledge potential biases in the analysis.\n- Indicate the confidence level for each inference (High/Medium/Low).\n\n### IMPORTANT:\nMaintain a professional but empathetic tone, as if presenting a constructive personal development report. Avoid judgment; focus on objective observations and actionable insights.\n\nBegin the analysis with: **\"BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS REPORT AND USER PROFILE\"**  \u201c\n\nLet me know how it goes for you.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kwcqo5/selfanalysis_prompt_i_made_to_test_with_ai_works/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Man arrested after car hits pedestrians during Liverpool FC victory parade", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/26/man-arrested-car-crowd-liverpool-fc-football-fans", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US Archaeologists Face Uncertain Future With Trump Administration Cuts", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/science/archaeology-trump-federal-budget.html?unlocked_article_code=1.KE8.Ya4J.J6e5TQV3JDyV", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What is today's date?", "summary": "So I don't use AI much but figured I would play around with OpenWebUI and Ollama.
