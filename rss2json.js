But I'm not sure how early we can used carbon dating to determine the age of something. Anything withing the lower end of the order of hundreds of years would probably need to also take into account the age of the organism and the type of biomaterial they use in the sample (mummified flesh vs bones as those different cell types have different rates of carbon replacement). Sources on this specific question are welcomed.\n\nThanks for your input!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1dek503/what_is_the_earliest_that_carbon_dating_can_be/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Armenia to leave Russia-led security pact", "summary": "", "link": "https://oc-media.org/armenia-to-leave-russia-led-security-pact/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Master\u2019s programs with GIS program/certification?", "summary": "I\u2019ve started to look at options for an MA in archaeology, and am having worries about future job opportunities.
