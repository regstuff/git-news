I am hoping to do my PhD in the US but I am open to doing my master's anywhere. My options are to apply to the few European unis open now or wait a year for the next US cycle. Would prefer the former to save time + money. For now, I have looked at TU Darmstadt (which looks like the closest to what I want), Stuttgart, University of Lorraine.

This seems to be an effective tool in this regard.\n\nGiven this dynamic, my question is: What should India do wrt US treasuries?\n\n* Given relatively cheaper US treasuries available in the secondary market, should India buy it (they have decent enough USD reserves for now) to increase the US treasuries they own? Should India use that as potential threat by coordinating their steps with others in this regard?\n* Would buying more US treasuries by India create other issues for India?

I live along a coastal river in one of the Carolinas (USA) and was digging in the sand with the kids along a beach area. I pulled up a few rocks, all of which have different characteristics. \n\nTwo look like I would imagine earthenware pottery looks like. There are three lines in it that look manufactured, and it is embedded with grains of sand. One side is red and the other is darker. \n\nI have another piece that sort of seems like bone to me. It is light and very smooth to the touch. It fits quite perfectly between your thumb and pointer finger. This could be nothing but it's interesting nonetheless. \n\nAnother piece is a shell with two small holes. This is the least convincing but it does appear that a fiber of some kind could have been run through it to be worn a jewelry. \n\nLastly, I have a piece that is what I'd call chunky on one side and smooth on the other. It is red and black. Mind you I don't know what this one could be. The river here is pretty tame at nearly 1.75 miles wide at this point so it isn't very swift and the bottom is essentially silt and sand. I don't know that normal weathering would create the smooth portion but I've been wrong before. \n\nTLDR; Can you tell me if these may be related to Native Americans who once resided in the coastal Carolina region?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx6uzs", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mastering Prompt Engineering: Practical Techniques That Actually Work", "summary": "After working with AI models extensively, I've discovered that the quality of your prompts directly determines the quality of your results. Here are some of the most effective prompt engineering techniques I've discovered:\n\n# Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting\n\n**Zero-shot**\u00a0(asking directly without examples) works well for simple tasks:\n\n    Classify this movie review as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\n    \n    Review: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction humanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving, unchecked. I wish there were more movies like this masterpiece.\n\n**Few-shot**\u00a0(including examples) dramatically improves performance for complex tasks:\n\n    Parse a customer's pizza order into valid JSON:\n    \n    EXAMPLE:\n    I want a small pizza with cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni.\n    JSON Response:\n    {\n      \"size\": \"small\",\n      \"type\": \"normal\",\n      \"ingredients\": [[\"cheese\", \"tomato sauce\", \"pepperoni\"]]\n    }\n    \n    EXAMPLE:\n    Can I get a large pizza with tomato sauce, basil and mozzarella\n    {\n      \"size\": \"large\",\n      \"type\": \"normal\",\n      \"ingredients\": [[\"tomato sauce\", \"basil\", \"mozzarella\"]]\n    }\n    \n    Now, I would like a large pizza, with the first half cheese and mozzarella. And the other half tomato sauce, ham and pineapple.\n\n# The Power of Context &amp; Roles\n\n**Standard prompt**\u00a0(generic response):\n\n    Explain why my website might be loading slowly.\n\n**Role prompt**\u00a0(expert-level response):\n\n    I want you to act as a senior web performance engineer with 15 years of experience optimizing high-traffic websites. Explain why my website might be loading slowly and suggest the most likely fixes, prioritized by impact vs. effort.\n\n**Contextual prompt**\u00a0(targeted response):\n\n    Context: I run a blog focused on 1980s arcade games. My audience consists mainly of collectors and enthusiasts in their 40s-50s who played these games when they were originally released.\n    \n    Write a blog post about underappreciated arcade games from 1983-1985 that hardcore collectors should seek out today.\n\n# Advanced Reasoning Techniques\n\n**Chain of Thought**\u00a0dramatically improves accuracy:\n\n    Q: If I have 15 apples and give 2/5 to my friend, then eat 3 myself, how many do I have left? Let's think step by step.\n\n**Step-Back**\u00a0approach for complex analysis:\n\n    Before we analyze if investing in Amazon stock is a good idea right now, let's first establish the key factors that should be considered when evaluating any stock investment.\n    \n    Once we have that framework, we'll apply it specifically to Amazon, considering their recent 20% revenue increase but declining margins.\n\n# Code Prompting That Works\n\n**For writing code**\u00a0(detailed context is key):\n\n    I need a Python function that parses CSV files and extracts specific columns.\n    \n    Technical context:\n    - Python 3.10+\n    - Using standard library only (no pandas)\n    - Will process files up to 1GB in size\n    \n    Specific requirements:\n    1. Function should accept a filepath and a list of column names\n    2. Should handle CSV files with or without headers\n    3. Skip malformed rows and log their line numbers\n    \n    Expected inputs:\n    - filepath: string (path to existing CSV file)\n    - columns: list of strings (column names to extract)\n    - has_headers: boolean, default True\n    \n    Please include proper docstrings and type hints.\n\n**For debugging code:**\n\n    Please help me debug this function that's producing incorrect results:\n    \n    [paste your code]\n    \n    The issue I'm experiencing is: [describe the problem]\n    \n    Please analyze:\n    1. Syntax errors or obvious bugs\n    2. Logical errors that might cause the issue\n    3. Edge cases that aren't properly handled\n    4. Suggestions for improvement\n\nThese techniques have saved me countless hours and dramatically improved my results when working with AI.
