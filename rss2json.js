This can be as easy as copying and pasting the material into your prompt, or using something more advanced like retrieval-augmented generation. As someone who uses this in a lot of production workflows, I want to share my top tips for effective grounding. \n\n# 1. Start Small with What You Have\n\nCurate the 20% of docs that answer 80% of questions. Pull your FAQs, checklists, and \"how to...?\" emails.\n\n* **Do:** upload 5-10 high-impact items to NotebookLM etc. and let the AI index them.\n* **Don't:** dump every archive folder on day one.\n* **Today:** list recurring questions and upload the matching docs.\n\n# 2. Add Examples and Clarity\n\nLLMs thrive on concrete scenarios.\n\n* **Do:** work an example into each doc, e.g., \"Error 405 after a password change? Follow these steps...\" Explain acronyms the first time you use them.\n* **Don't:** assume the reader (or the AI) shares your context.\n* **Today:** edit one doc; add a real-world example and spell out any shorthand.\n\n# 3. Keep it Simple.\n\nHeadings, bullets, one topic per file, work better than a tome.\n\n* **Do:** caption visuals (\"Figure 2: three-step approval flow\").\n* **Don't:** hide answers in a 100-page \"everything\" PDF, split big files by topic.\n* **Today:** re-head a clunky doc and break it into smaller pieces if needed.\n\n# 4. Group and Label Intuitively\n\nMake it obvious where things live, and who they're for.\n\n* **Do:** create themed folders or notebooks (\"Onboarding,\" \"Discount Steps\") and title files descriptively: \"Internal - Discount Process - Q3 2025.\"\n* **Don't:** mix confidential notes with customer-facing articles.\n* **Today:** spin up one folder/notebook and move three to five docs into it with clear names.\n\n# 5. Test and Tweak, then Keep It Fresh\n\nA quick test run exposes gaps faster than any audit.\n\n* **Do:** ask the AI a handful of real questions that you know the answer to. See what it cites, and fix the weak spots.\n* **Do:** Archive duplicates; keep obsolete info only if you label when and why it applied (\"Policy for v 8.13 - spring 2020 customers\"). Plan a quarterly ten-minute sweep, \\~30 % of data goes stale each year.\n* **Don't:** skip the test drive or wait for an annual doc day.\n* **Today:** upload your starter set, fire off three queries, and fix one issue you spot.\n\n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lxhioa/5_things_you_can_do_today_to_ground_ai_and_why_it/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nearly 800 killed at Gaza food hubs and aid convoy routes since end of May, UN says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/11/killed-gaza-food-hubs-aid-convoy-routes-since-end-may-un", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OPEN SOURCE IDE", "summary": "this IDE have a lot of bugs and please help me to fix the bug I will also be happy if you use it, thanks :)", "link": "https://github.com/maxwellzhang2011/CSPode", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open Source Alternative to Docsend", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/mfts/papermark", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Taliban Tells Afghan, 45, Who Married 6-Year-Old: \"Wait Till She's 9\"", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taliban-halts-45-year-old-afghan-mans-marriage-to-6-year-old-girl-sets-age-9-to-take-her-home-8853231#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;aoh=17522394418893&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ndtv.com%2Fworld-news%2Ftaliban-halts-45-year-old-afghan-mans-marriage-to-6-year-old-girl-sets-age-9-to-take-her-home-8853231", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Does the war in Ukraine risk Russia becoming subservient to/overdependent on China? What will this mean for Indian security more broadly?", "summary": "The Russia Ukraine war is one of the most high profile conflicts in recent history, and this war has had ramifications for many countries around the world. So far, India has taken a neutral stance in this war, urging dialogue while also buying oil from Russia and maintaining close relations with Russia. However, could this war also have ramifications for India and its security? Historically, India has always tried to maintain strong relations with Russia not only because of close defence cooperation, but also because Russia was hoped to be a counterbalance to China, with which India maintains tense relations with given outstanding border disputes. However, the Russia Ukraine war has complicated things. With the western world placing sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been forced to rely on other countries to maintain its war effort, chief of which is China. This has led to a situation in which Russia China ties have strengthened dramatically due to Russia's dependence on China. With this in mind, what impacts do you think this will have on Indian security more broadly? Will this risk India becoming more isolated in its tense standoff with China? If Russia is incapable of ending this war quickly and weaning itself off China, should India look elsewhere to find partners against China that aren't as dependent on China?
