A microphone translated phonemes into distinct patterns enabling the profoundly dead to passively learn various words and phrases without a concealer implant. The broader topic of his talk was titled \"sensory substitution.\" Anytime a technology is unveiled that has the potential to give an individual a \"leg up\" on their fellow man, the convention is almost universally to demonstrate the way such a technology could address some major \"disability.\"  Here is a link to the video for reference:\n\n\n\nI think it's safe to say that it would be taboo to go on the stage and demonstrate such a technology solely as a means for gaining some cognitive advantage. Yet, Eagleman is quite overt in his suggestion that such technology holds promise in expanding the human \"umvelt\" or \"sensory horizon.\" His fundamental thesis is \"the brain doesn't care where information input comes from so long as it's consistent, the brain will make sense of that input.\" He even mentions \"one could imagine plugging in live data from the stock market and seeing if the mind might find some interesting patterns emerging.\" \n\nI've long wondered why there have been no major consumer products as a result of Eagleman's work yet a quick glance at his bio shows the bulk of his funding is from the alphabet soup military intelligence agencies. It seems very plausible the funding that led to the development of that vest came with caveats of exclusive contracts with the DOD where there are in fact a variety of similar systems employed to give pilots and drone operators heightened abilities to control various craft via haptic feedback. \n\nIf one revisits his first major achievement with the deaf, it demonstrates haptics are a rich domain for augmenting language capabilities. Let's imagine for instance that one wears a smartwatch complete with the standard biometric sensors most fitbits possess. Now, translate those biometrics to haptic states and the wearer may gain a more visceral, intuitive understanding of their physical state. Additionally, imagine the ability to share such states with a loved one. It's important to remember that the deaf participants in the study passively learned to translate the vibratory patterns into words and sentences. Therefore, learning with such technology appears to be most effective when it's passive. \n\nThe most substantial barrier to developing a non invasive BCI capable of communicating higher concepts is the \"input problem.\" Yes, advances have been made in consumer EEG products yet they're not yet sufficient to be useful for \"telepathy\" type communication beyond the laboratory setting (using more powerful brain imaging systems). However, is it not feasible to begin building a \"universal haptic language\" with the help of LLM's and real time translation engines? Additionally, simply enabling an extrasensory modality, like augmenting geospatial awareness with a digital compass seems like a rich area for discovery. Afterall, Hawkin's \"Thousand Brains\" theory of intelligence rests on spatio-temporal reference frames. That is to say working memory relies on spatial reference frames both externally and internally. \n\nMight greater geospatial awareness result in heightened memory? The \"Loci Method\" and \"Memory Palace\" techniques employed by memory champions leverages the brain's innate mechanisms for memory storage to recall voluminous amounts of information. I would appreciate constructive feedback on this framework with ideas that add elements to this basic concept to explore.
