For the Comet browser's full capabilities, you'll need the highest tier Max subscription. I don't get any benefit at all from people giving Perplexity money but you get what you pay for is real here.  \n  \nPro Tips for Maximum Results:\n\n# 1. Model Selection Strategy (Perplexity Max Only):\n\nFor these prompts, I've found the best results using:\n\n* **Claude 4 Opus**: Best for complex analysis, financial modeling, and legal document review\n* **GPT-4o or o3**: Excellent for creative content strategies and market research\n* **Claude 4 Sonnet**: Ideal for technical documentation and troubleshooting guides\n\nPro tip: Start with Claude 4 Opus for the initial deep analysis, then switch to faster models for follow-up questions.\n\n# 2. Focus Mode Selection:\n\n* Academic: For prompts 3, 5, and 10 (research-heavy)\n* Writing: For prompt 4 (content strategy)\n* Reddit: For prompts 9 (customer insights)\n* Default: For all others\n\n# 3. Comet Browser Advanced Usage:\n\nThe Comet browser (available with Max) is essential for:\n\n* Real-time competitor monitoring\n* Live financial data extraction\n* Dynamic market analysis\n* Multi-tab research sessions\n\n# 4. Chain Your Prompts:\n\n* Start broad, then narrow down\n* Use outputs from one prompt as inputs for another\n* Build comprehensive research documents\n\n# 5. Visualization Best Practices:\n\n* Always explicitly request \"Create data visualizations\"\n* Specify chart types when you have preferences\n* Ask for \"exportable formats\" for client presentations\n\n# Real-World Results:\n\nUsing these templates with Perplexity Pro, I've:\n\n* Reduced research time by 75%\n* Prepare for meetings with partners and clients 3X faster\n* Get work done on legal, finance, marketing functions 5X faster\n\n# The \"Perplexity Stack\"\n\nMy complete research workflow:\n\n1. **Perplexity Max**\u00a0(highest tier for Comet) - $200/month\n2. **Notion**\u00a0for organizing outputs - $10/month\n3. **Tableau**\u00a0for advanced visualization - $70/month\n4. **Zapier**\u00a0for automation - $30/month\n\nTotal cost: \\~$310/month vs these functions would cost me closer to $5,000-$10,000 in time and tools before with old research tools / processes.\n\nI don't make any money from promoting Perplexity, I just think prompts like this deliver some really good results - better than other LLMs for most of these use cases.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m9b07u/i_replaced_all_my_manual_google_manual_research/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Need Help in installing OpenWebUI on my MAC", "summary": "Good day folks.\n\nI have ollama running on a corporate cluster i.e. such as: \\ and the response I get when I directly open this link on my web browser is:\n\n    Ollama is running\n\n\n\nMy Question is: \n\n  \nSince I am installing openwebUI on my mac using: \n\n  \npodman run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL= --name open-webui --restart always [ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main](\n\nI do get the following in the container logs: \n\n  \n\u279c  \\~ podman logs -f open-webui\n\n[\n\n    Loading WEBUI_SECRET_KEY from file, not provided as an environment variable.\n    Generating WEBUI_SECRET_KEY\n    Loading WEBUI_SECRET_KEY from .webui_secret_key\n    /app/backend/open_webui\n    /app/backend\n    /app\n    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.\n    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.\n    WARNI [open_webui.env]\n    \n    WARNING: CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN IS SET TO '*' -

I corrected some problems that occurred when i was trying to test ParvaOS on a new computer during the setup process, so now everything should work (if it doesn't feel free to open an issue). I also added a **neofetch** command that prints a basic ASCII logo on screen, just **for the fun of flexing ParvaOS \ud83d\ude0e!**\n\nI'd also like to take this opportunity to say that I'm still a bit unsure about what additional features to add to ParvaOS.

However, all this also makes me wonder whether, and to what extent, it's worth committing to a project if you're completely alone or if you receive no feedback whatsoever, whether positive or negative.\n\nIn any case, I thank everyone who wishes to leave a star for this project: for me, it already means that all my dedication has created something useful for someone else, and in the open-source world there is no greater joy.\n\nAs always, have fun \ud83d\ude09\n\nYou can find the github repo here: [", "link": "http://github.com/gianndev/ParvaOS", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tea, an app that lets women gossip about men leaked its own user database with drivers license and full IDs (app is currently #1 on app store)", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-breached-users-ids-posted-to-4chan/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Magistral-Small-2507 not thinking consistently?", "summary": "I'm not a big Magistral user so I decided to give it a try, and I'm not seeing it think consistently, and if it does, I don't see it using thinking tags.
