And what is it exactly? \n\nQ2: Why is there a debate about sadhguru and OSHO what do they both preach? And who is better in terms of wisdom and knowledge?\n\nThank you ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bqtr8i/a_question_about_karma_and_sadhguru_and_osho/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I got absolutely fed up with disturbing noises from my family during sadhana", "summary": "Hi, I have a question. I always at the weekends want to sleep atleast an hour more than during the week because I want to rest from the job I'm doing all the week. But my family starts waking up also. Many times they talked right in front of my room door's, were preparing breakfast for themselves so they were making noises, smashing doors etc. etc. Many times I got fed up, but I held it or I normally told them after sadhana. But this time I have had enough, I have had really stressful days at work also. So when I was doing Shambhavi, all I heard were them talking and making noises, I never did this before, but I just couldn't stand it so I shouted loudly SILENCE! But that was during Shambhavi. I resolved it with my family, but my question is if those things can do something bad in my system, that during Shambhavi I shouted like this. Ofcourse I felt off etc. But if it could do something worse, if you have for example heard Isha yoga teacher talk about this or something.

It's an archaeological history from horse evolution through their first interactions with early hominins through their initial domestication, innovation of things like chariots and mounted horseback riding, and spread across the globe. It's based on about a decade or so of archaeological science work in places like Mongolia, Argentina, and even the Great Plains, and hopefully will include a lot of things you won't have heard before. If you don't like to support evil Amazon, it's up on B&amp;N, Google Play, etc. too.\n\n[\n\nHappy to answer questions if you have any - but appreciate you spreading the word, and grabbing a copy if it looks interesting. My take on horse domestication is sometimes a little controversial, so if you like archaeology drama there's plenty for you.
