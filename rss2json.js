But he had now decided not to maintain the tradition, reports\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*, a leading daily.\n\nThe newspaper spoke to representatives of the Jewish community in Poland, who confirmed that no invitations have been sent by the presidential palace, despite the eight-day celebration of Hanukkah beginning on Sunday\n\nThe website of the president\u2019s chancellery does not list any planned Hanukkah events. When contacted by\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0about the issue, the president\u2019s media office failed to respond.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail in January this year, Nawrocki\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that, if elected president, he would not continue his predecessor\u2019s tradition of celebrating Hanukkah.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he told broadcast RMF when asked if he would host a celebration of the Jewish festival in the presidential palace. \u201cI take my attachment to Christian values \u200b\u200bseriously, so I celebrate holidays that are close to me as a person.\u201d\n\nDuring the final, run-off round of the election in June, Nawrocki also sought to win over the voters of eliminated candidate Grzegorz Braun, a far-right leader who infamously\u00a0[attacked a Hanukkah celebration](\u00a0in parliament, putting out the candles with a fire extinguisher.\n\nIn response to a set of questions from Braun \u2013 including whether he would \u201creject Jewish claims\u201d against Poland \u2013 Nawrocki\u00a0[wrote](\u00a0that he \u201ctakes my attachment to Christian values \u200b\u200bseriously, so I celebrate and promote holidays and the Polish traditions and customs associated with them\u201d.\n\nSubsequently, Braun, who has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, announced that he would vote for Nawrocki in the run-off. Exit polling\u00a0[showed](\u00a0that, among voters who had supported Braun in the first round and turned out in the second round, 92.5% voted for Nawrocki.\n\nHowever, after Nawrocki took office, news website Interia reported, based on inside sources, that some presidential officials still wanted to host a Hanukkah celebration \u2013 in particular to remain on good terms with the Trump administration, whose\u00a0[newly appointed ambassador](\u00a0to Poland, Tom Rose, is Jewish.\n\nWhile it now appears that no Hanukkah celebration will be organised in the presidential palace, one will take place in the Sejm, the lower house of parliament, on Monday 15 December.\n\nParliament is under the control of Poland\u2019s more liberal ruling coalition, which regularly clashes with Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nBefore the Holocaust, Poland was home to around 3.5 million Jews, roughly 10% of the country\u2019s population and the second-largest Jewish community in the world at the time, behind only the United States.

Is Przemy\u015bl in Ukraine?\u201d asked another.\n\nIn some cases, Bakun responded to comments, explaining that blue had been chosen because it is the colour of the coat of arms.\n\nHowever, this week, he posted a new photograph of the teddy bear, showing that its scarf had been changed from blue to red \u2013 a colour associated with both Christmas and the white-and-red Polish national flag.\n\n\u201cA slight wardrobe change to prevent false associations from overshadowing the magic of the holidays. Ho ho ho,\u201d wrote the mayor.\n\nIn a further comment, Bakun said that, while he \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d the criticism of the original colours, \u201cwe really wouldn\u2019t want children and, above all, the Christmas atmosphere to suffer in any way\u201d.\n\nSome other politicians, however, criticised Bakun\u2019s decision. \u201cThe mayor has made Przemy\u015bl look ridiculous,\u201d said city councillor Anna Grad-Mizga\u0142a, quoted by the\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0daily.\n\nMarek Rz\u0105sa, an MP from Poland\u2019s main centrist ruling party, Civic Coalition (KO), said that Przemy\u015bl had \u201csuccumbed to a handful of unidentified internet trolls or Russian bots\u201d.\n\nAnother of Poland\u2019s ruling parties, The Left (Lewica), made fun of the situation, thanking Bakun for switching the teddy bear\u2019s scarf to the \u201cleftist colour\u201d of red, reports\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*.\n\nGiven its close proximity to Ukraine, Przemy\u015bl became a major transit point for the millions of refugees fleeing from Ukraine after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. In July of that year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Przemy\u015bl the title of \u201cRescue City\u201d in honour of the help it had given.\n\nThe city also itself has a significant Ukrainian minority population and is home to a cultural centre known as Ukrainian House, the history of which dates back over a century.\n\nAlmost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland, alongside hundreds of thousands more Ukrainian economic migrants, students and others, making them by far Poland\u2019s largest immigrant group.\n\nTheir presence has come in for\u00a0[growing criticism from far-right groups]( who\u00a0[warn of the \u201cUkrainisation\u201d of Poland]( Right-wing President Karol Nawrocki has also pushed for\u00a0[tougher restrictions](\u00a0on support for Ukrainian refugees and has proposed a law banning the promotion of Ukrainian nationalist ideology.\n\nIn October this year, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Bodnar, announced that the Ukrainian flag outside the country\u2019s consulate in Przemy\u015bl had been torn down for the fifth time this year.\u00a0 He blamed the \u201cwave of anti-Ukrainian hate on social media\u201d for inspiring such actions.\n\nIn April, far-right presidential candidate Grzegorz Braun, who has been one of the chief proponents of claims that Poland is being \u201cUkrainised\u201d, and his supporters\u00a0[took down](\u00a0a Ukrainian flag hanging on a municipal building in the city of Bia\u0142a Podlaska in eastern Poland.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/12/polish-city-changes-colour-of-christmas-bears-scarf-after-complaints-it-looked-too-ukrainian/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Nigeria] Group calls for immediate closure of Tiger Base facility in lmo", "summary": "", "link": "https://dailypost.ng/2025/12/14/group-calls-for-immediate-closure-of-tiger-base-facility-in-lmo/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
