I have been rummaging through this space and I can't seem to find the thing I am looking for, I am willing to drop some money for a good program, but if possible I would like it to stay free with unlimited word count/attempts. I'm currently looking for a TTS that can bring a story to life while reading it, I have a few buddies that are trying to get into running their own AI DnD campaigns and they are having a good time but missing the narrative, I would like to find a TTS that brings it to life. Even if I can record like 10 minutes of my own audio and upload it and have it base the emotion off my voice, but I can't seem to find one that really hits that spot for me. It could be that it does not exist or have not looked hard enough. If you could help me out that would be much appreciated, thanks everyone!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1id9u7u/looking_for_a_good_tts_for_reading_a_story/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I made a website to track community weather stations across the globe!", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/NateBrune/Weather-Index", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Spectacular Roman Empire Criminal Case Unveiled Through a Newly Discovered Papyrus", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2025/01/a-spectacular-roman-empire-criminal-case-unveiled-through-a-newly-discovered-papyrus/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Will seek to scrap 'uneven agreements' with India: Bangladesh home adviser | External Affairs Defence Security News - Business Standard", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/will-seek-to-scrap-uneven-agreements-with-india-bangladesh-home-adviser-125012901284_1.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "After Hin,dus, Bangladeshi tribals targeted by radical Islamists\u2014journalist &amp; activist Parban Chakma", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/world/after-hindus-bangladeshi-tribals-targeted-by-radical-islamists-journalist-activist-parban-chakma/2468400/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India seeking energy, lithium investments in Argentina | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-seeking-energy-lithium-investments-argentina-2025-01-29/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rare votive treasures of the Cham people found in \u201cSacred Pit\u201d", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.heritagedaily.com/2025/01/rare-votive-treasures-of-the-champa-people-found-in-sacred-pit/154368", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia claims nuclear plant targeted during massive Ukrainian drone attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2025/1/29/russia-claims-nuclear-plant-targeted-during-massive-ukrainian-drone-attack", "author": "None"}, {"title": "1985 Air India bombing: Hitman given life sentence in Canada for murder of suspect in 2022", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1985-air-india-bombing-hitman-given-life-sentence-in-canada-for-murder-of-suspect-in-2022/article69153828.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hasina's Awami League calls for nationwide strike, labels Yunus govt 'sponsors of radical militancy'", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/world/hasinas-awami-league-calls-for-nationwide-strike-labels-yunus-govt-sponsors-of-radical-militancy/2468148/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine\u2019s military fights fires on many fronts amid battlefield setbacks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/01/29/ukraines-military-fights-fires-on-many-fronts-amid-battlefield-setbacks/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poll: Scottish attitudes to the British Empire | Scots are more likely to see Scotland as having been a subject, rather than a partner, in the British Empire", "summary": "", "link": "https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/51482-scottish-attitudes-to-the-british-empire", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India tries to give Trump \u2018quick wins.\u2019 What does Modi want in return?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/28/india-trump-modi-trade-tariffs-immigration/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists have uncovered two lost settlements of ancient Rome", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.archaeologs.com/n/archaeologists-have-uncovered-two-lost-settlements-of-ancient-rome", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Newman\u2019s Own invites more companies to donate 100% of their profits to charities", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/newmans-own-paul-newman-corporate-purpose-9f572c6143c40a080e3db231882bb034", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nearly 300 Romanian mercenaries surrendered to rebels in DR Congo", "summary": "", "link": "https://romania.news-pravda.com/en/world/2025/01/29/3348.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sri Lanka Navy chief says accidental firing injured Indian fishermen", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sri-lanka-navy-chief-says-accidental-firing-injured-indian-fishermen/article69154731.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Maximilien Robespierre was appointed as one of the five judges in his local criminal court, but soon resigned due to his ethical dislike of the death penalty", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/l46a2qwp17ce1.jpeg", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
