During my undergraduate studies, I primarily worked with C, C++, and Python. My projects were centered around web development, machine learning, data analysis, speech technology, and natural language processing (NLP).\n\nIn my final semester, I developed a keen interest in NLP, which has since become a focus of my career aspirations. I graduated in May with a CGPA of 7.02 and recently moved to the USA in November. Since then, I have been actively searching for roles as a Web Developer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Engineer, or Data Scientist, creating tailored resumes for each role.\n\nDespite my efforts, I faced challenges in securing interviews, primarily due to the lack of a U.S. degree or relevant local experience. Even after participating in coding tests, I received no callbacks. Currently, I am exploring Coursera courses to enhance my skills and make my profile more competitive.\n\nI am deeply passionate about mathematics, research, and innovation, particularly in machine learning. My goal is to work in an environment where I can learn, explore, and gain practical experience. While some have suggested pursuing a master\u2019s degree to improve my prospects, I am uncertain about the best course of action.
