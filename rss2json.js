TLDR - [\n\nI decided to start working on a project for a smart assistant with some MCP integration on Raspberry Pi. But of course to start with it I need some wake word detection before streaming the input into an LLM. And I found out that available open source solutions are somewhat limited. You have to either go with classical MFCC + DTW solutions which don't provide good precision and require tuning for every user or you have to use model-based solutions that require at least basic ML knowledge to train/fine-tune models and you can't allow users to have custom wake words.\n\nSo I took advantages of these two approaches and implemented my own solution. It uses Google's speech-embedding to extract speech features from audio which is much more resilient to noise and voice tone as well as tolerates different speaker voices (tested with a reference set recorded by me with another person's voice as input). And then those features are compared with DTW which helps avoid temporal misalignment.\n\nSo far the precision of my approach is much better than classical MFCC + DTW, while taking only \\~25% of my Raspberry 4 CPU. But surprisingly I haven't seen (at least yet) anyone else using this approach.

I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I researched potential job paths, and found out some linguistics experts work in AI (particularly NLP). This sounded super exciting to me, so I managed to find an AI company that was running a grad scheme where they hired promising grads (without requiring CS degrees) for an analytics position, with the promise of moving to another team in the future. I moved to the AI team two years ago, where I've mostly been training intent classification models with Pytorch/HF Transformers, as well as some sentiment analysis stuff. I also have some genAI experience (mostly for machine translation and benchmarking against our 'old school' solutions).\n\nI've been very actively looking for a new job since March and to say I've been struggling is an understatement. I have barely seen any traditional NLP jobs like TTS/STT, text classification etc, and even when I do apply, the market seems so saturated with senior applicants that I get rejection after rejection. The only jobs that recruiters reach out to me about ate 'AI Engineer' kind of positions, and every time I see those I want to disintegrate. I personally really, REALLY dislike working on genAI - I feel like unless you're a researcher working on the algorithms, it's more of a programming job with calling genAI APIs and some prompting. I do not enjoy coding nearly as much as I do working with data, preprocessing datasets, learning about and applying ML techniques, and evaluating models.\n\nI also enjoy research, but nowhere wants to hire someone without a PhD or at the very least a Masters for a research position (and as I'm not a UK national, an ML Masters would cost me 30-40k for a year, which I cannot afford). I've even tried doing some MLOps courses, but didn't particularly enjoy it. I've considered moving to non-language data science (predictive modelling etc), but it's been taking a while upskilling in that area, and recruiters don't seem interested in the fact I have NLP machine learning experience, they want stuff like time series and financial/energy/health data experience.\n\nI just feel so defeated and hopeless. I felt so optimistic 4 years ago, excited for a future when I can shift my linguistics skills into creating AI-driven data insights. Now it feels like my NLP/linguistics background is a curse, as with genAI becoming the new coolest NLP thing, I only seem qualified for the jobs that I hate. I feel like I wasted the past 4 years chasing a doomed dream, and now I'm stuck with skills that no one seems to see as transferrable to other ML/DS jobs. So I guess my question is - is there still any demand for non-genAI NLP jobs? Should I hold onto this dream until the job market improves/genAI hype dies down? Or is traditional NLP dead and I should give up and change careers? I genuinely fell in love with machine learning and don't want to give up but I can't keep going like this anymore. I don't mind having the occasional genAI project, but I'd want the job to only have elements of it at most, not be an 'AI Engineer' or 'Prompt engineer'.\n\n(PS: Yes, I am 100% burnt out.)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1mmubob/nongenai_nlp_jobs_in_the_current_market/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How do you get gpt-5 to do reasoning?", "summary": "## This is with gpt-5 through openai.
