It is a rare instance of continuation after the Trump administration [froze all foreign funding]( last year and unleashed Elon Musk\u2019s [Department of Government Efficiency]( to tear down the agency that [delivered U.S. foreign aid]( for 60 years.\n\nOut of that destruction, which cost [tens of thousands of jobs]( and caused [people around the world to die]( many private efforts were made to preserve decades of data and knowledge housed at USAID, help recipients [keep vital programs running]( and [reimagine how international development]( might work.\n\nBut few of those efforts have managed to attract the kind of philanthropic funding that the DIV Fund has.\n\nSome of the leaders of the new nonprofit were also involved in directing [$110 million from private philanthropy]( in the past year to projects that lost funding from USAID. Now, the DIV Fund aims to grant out $25 million annually, which represents a little more than half of DIV\u2019s budget at USAID.\n\n##The ingredients of success\n\nTheir fundraising success has a couple of ingredients.\n\nFirst, the nonprofit DIV Fund acts like a research and development hub to identify very affordable and efficient interventions and then to support their expansion to scale. As such, their budget is very small compared to programs that treat or prevent HIV or respond to famine, for example.\n\nThen, while they were a division at USAID, DIV had already won outside philanthropic funding, including a $45 million grant from [Coefficient Giving]( a San Francisco-based funder that is now one of the nonprofit\u2019s anchor donors. The other funder is anonymous.\n\nFinally, Kremer said the programs they identify generally get funding from local governments or earn revenue, rather than depending on long term funding from donor countries like the U.S. That path to sustainability is even more important in the face of major cuts to foreign assistance from multiple historic donor countries.\n\n##See also:\n\n[World discovers it can hedge US trade risk \u2022 No one seeking outright decoupling from US, but risk-hedging is driving spate of new deals \u2022 Big powers could still set limits for rest of world]( (Reuters)", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/div-fund-usaid-foreign-aid-3d4b69f8a1c53fae17a39fd9af1f4f00", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland charges five men for smuggling cigarettes from Belarus with balloons", "summary": "Polish prosecutors have charged five people for smuggling cigarettes from Belarus to Poland using weather balloons.\n\nThey say that the gang\u2019s actions, as well as costing Poland over 2 million zloty (\u20ac474,000) in lost taxes, also helped support Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine by providing income to Belarus, which is an ally of Moscow.\n\nSince 2024, smugglers have\u00a0[increasingly used balloons](\u00a0to carry cigarettes over the border with Poland, as a\u00a0[migration and security crisis](\u00a0on the border has shut down traditional smuggling routes by road, rail and land.\n\nPoland has also accused Belarus of using the balloons to test Polish air defences as part of Minsk and Moscow\u2019s \u201chybrid actions\u201d, which also include\u00a0[migrant smuggling]( acts of\u00a0[sabotage](\u00a0[cyberattacks](\u00a0and\u00a0[disinformation](\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutors announced that they have charged five men with operating a criminal group that smuggled cigarettes by balloon from Belarus, using GPS trackers embedded inside the packages to locate them once they reached Poland.\n\nPolish broadcaster Polsat reports that the suspects comprise two Polish citizens, two Ukrainians and one Belarusian.\n\nAs well as being accused of running a criminal gang that smuggled at least 48,000 packs of cigarettes \u2013 causing losses of more than 2 million zloty to the state treasury \u2013\u00a0 the men have also been charged with violating air traffic regulations.\n\nFinally, prosecutors say that their actions helped \u201cBelarus to diversify its sources of income and thus enable it to participate in Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine\u201d, thereby violating a law on counteracting support for aggression against Ukraine.\n\nInvestigators note that among the smuggled cigarettes were some produced by Grodno Tobacco Factory Neman, which is a Belarusian state-controlled enterprise.\n\nOn Wednesday, the district court in Siedlce ordered that all five suspects be placed in pretrial detention for a period of three months. The men reportedly admitted to committing the crimes. They could face from 9 months to 12 years in prison if found guilty.\n\nWeather balloons from Belarus continue to regularly enter Polish airspace.

That came days after Poland\u00a0[increased its export capacity](\u00a0to help supply its eastern neighbour.\n\nThe surge in exports pushed total transmission through the national gas network in Poland \u2013 which itself imports most of its gas from abroad, particularly Norway, the United States and Qatar \u2013 to 115.4 million cubic metres in a single day, which was also a new record.\n\nMonthly volumes have also climbed. In January, gas transport through the system exceeded 3 billion cubic metres, with average daily transmission of about 97 million cubic metres. That was 45% higher than a year earlier, due to\u00a0[colder weather](\u00a0and growing domestic gas use and exports.\n\nFrom the start of February, Poland began boosting its capacity for gas exports to Ukraine.
