Alongside my studies, I've started to develop a few personal Python projects.\n\nMy first big open-source project: A single-stock analysis tool that uses both market and financial statements informations. It also integrates news sentiment analysis (FinBert and Pygooglenews), as well as LSTM forecast for the stock price. You can also enable Ollama to get information complements using a local LLM.\n\n**What my project (FinAPy) does:**\n\n* Prologue: Ticker input collection and essential functions and data: *In this part, the program gets in input a ticker from the user, and asks wether or not he wants to enable the AI analysis. Then, it generates a short summary about the company fetching information from Yahoo Finance, so the user has something to read while the next step proceeds. It also fetches the main financial metrics and computes additional ones.*\n* Step 1: Events and news fetching: *This part fetches stock events from Yahoo Finance and news from Google RSS feed. It also generates a sentiment analysis about the articles fetched using FinBERT.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Step 2: Forecast using Machine Learning LSTM: *This part creates a baseline scenario from a LSTM forecast. The forecast covers 60 days and is trained from 100 last values of close/ high/low prices. It is a quantiative model only. An optimistic and pessimistic scenario are then created by tweaking the main baseline to give a window of prediction. They do not integrate macroeconomic factors, specific metric variations nor Monte Carlo simulations for the moment.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Step 3: Market data restitution: *This part is dedicated to restitute graphically the previously computed data. It also computes CFA classical metrics (histogram of returns, skewness, kurtosis) and their explanation. The part concludes with an Ollama AI commentary of the analysis.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Step 4: Financial statement analysis: *This part is dedicated to the generation of the main ratios from the financial statements of the last 3 years of the company. Each part concludes with an Ollama AI commentary on the ratios. The analysis includes an overview of the variation, and highlights in color wether the change is positive or negative. Each ratio is commented so you can understand what they represent/ how they are calculated. The ratios include:*\n   * Profitability ratios:\u00a0Profit margin, ROA, ROCE, ROE,...\n   * Asset related ratios:\u00a0Asset turnover, working capital.\n   * Liquidity ratios:\u00a0Current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio.\n   * Solvency ratios:\u00a0debt to assets, debt to capital, financial leverage, coverage ratios,...\n   * Operational ratios (cashflow related):\u00a0CFI/ CFF/ CFO ratios, cash return on assets,...\n   * Bankrupcy and financial health scores: Altman Z-score/ Ohlson O-score.\n* Appendix: Financial statements: *A summary of the financial statements scaled for better readability in case you want to push the manual analysis further.*\n\n**Target audience:** Students, researchers,... For educational and research purpose only. However, it illustrates how local LLMs could be integrated into industry practices and workflows.\n\n**Comparison:** The project enables both a market and statement analysis perspective, and showcases how a local LLM can run in a financial context while showing to which extent it can bring something to analysts.\n\nAt this point, I'm considering starting to work on industry metrics (for comparability of ratios) and portfolio construction.
