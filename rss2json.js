Jaishankar, [NDTV World Summit]( 21-22 October 2024\n\nBajpai, Kanti (2021). Perimeters: From cooperation to conflict. In\u00a0*India versus China: Why they are not friends*\u00a0(pp. 101\u2013103). Juggernaut\n\n&gt;*The decision for war*\n\n&gt;From all accounts, China finally took a decision to go to war on 6 October. They attacked in strength in both the eastern and western sectors two weeks later. Four days into the war, Zhou offered Nehru a deal; in the western sector, both armies would pull back twenty kilometres from the Line of Actual Control as on 7 November 1959. China would then return to its positions north of the McMahon Line. This would be followed by a meeting of the two prime ministers. When Delhi rejected the proposal, China resumed operations on 16 November. With Indian defences crumbling, China abruptly stopped its advance on 21 November and started to pull back to positions north of the McMahon Line. The war, of eleven days of actual fighting, was over. It remains India's shortest war.\n\n&gt;Why in the end did China attack? The best account of Chinese decision-making is Garver's, which is based on China's official histories, informed accounts by former officials, and academic writings. In it, he argues that Mao and his senior advisers were convinced that India was destabilising Tibet and wanted to turn it into an independent buffer zone; that India in the end did not want to negotiate any or all parts of the border sincerely and was not open to a political resolution (that is, the swap); and that the Forward Policy was militarily provocative and dangerous for China. While there may have been other motives as well - and Garver suggests that Chinese discourse on the necessity of war also refers to the relations with Moscow and Washington - Tibet, the border stalemate, and the Forward Policy were central.\n\n&gt;At the heart of it all was not territory itself. Rather, it was the significance of the territory, particularly in the western sector, for Chinese control over Tibet. Given Beijing's assessment of Indian behaviour on Tibet, the border negotiations, and Indian military moves, it decided that Delhi needed to be administered a painful shock. A limited Chinese attack would be fruitless: defeating a weak Indian force in the west would fail to make the strategic point. Mao insisted on a large-scale attack all along the border but aimed particularly at India's military strength, which was in the eastern sector. It was also the case that in border negotiations India had been most adamant in refusing to discuss the McMahon Line. On 6 October, when China received India's rejection of Beijing's 3 October proposal for talks on the entire border, the decision for war was more or less made. The military was told, 'If Indian forces attack us, you should hit back fiercely . . . not only repel them, but hit them fiercely and make them hurt.' Marshal Liu Bocheng, who headed the Central Military Commission (CMC), insisted that Chinese forces could not use limited tactics but rather had to 'kill, wound, and capture the enemy'.\n\n&gt;China was helped in its war decision-making by American and Soviet diplomacy. Beijing's relations with both powers were tense, but ironically their messaging reassured China in respect of war with India. In May 1962, Zhou asked the Chinese diplomat Wang Bingnan to meet his US counterpart in Warsaw. Since 1955, in absence of formal diplomatic ties, China and the US had convened a dialogue in Poland to deal with bilateral matters (which, in a further irony, India had helped organise).\n\n&gt;In 1962, Wang's mission was to assess the US response to a possible Taiwanese invasion of the mainland. Beijing feared that the US might allow the Taiwanese, who were threatening to invade, to mount an attack into southern China from Laos. If so, China would have been at war in the west with India and in the south with the Taiwanese forces. In June, to Beijing's relief, the US told Wang that Washington would not support a Taiwanese attack. By July, an international peace agreement had been signed, committing the US not to deploy its troops in Laos, further suggesting that China's southern flank was secure. The US may therefore have unwittingly contributed to China's decision to go to war with India.\n\n&gt;**The Soviet role was less unwitting**. Moscow and Beijing had been drifting apart ideologically and strategically since the late 1950s, **but in October 1962 as the Cuban missile crisis loomed, the Soviets shifted ground in the India-China quarrel**. In 1959, Khrushchev had had some harsh words for Mao and Zhou on their handling of Tibet and India. But by October 1962, knowing that the emplacement of nuclear weapons in Cuba was likely to develop into a crisis with Washington, Moscow wanted to firm up support in the socialist world. China was vital in this regard. On 14 October, **just six days before China attacked India, Moscow conveyed to Beijing that it would 'stand together with China' in the event of an India-China war**. Garver suggests in addition that **the Soviets may even have indicated the dates of the impending missile crisis, namely, late October to mid-November when US congressional elections were due**. This time frame coincided nicely with Beijing's eventual plans to go to war with India.
