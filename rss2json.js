However, I'm not sure where to talk about this because I'm mostly interested in the techniques that are less than ethical and I want to only talk about how they work and how to counteract them but not instruct anyone in these techniques.\n\nIt's not neuro-linguistic programming though but a system that combines algorithmic automatisation, stochastics, psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics. Basically, it's structured as a form of \"hacking\" but instead of using software exploits to install agents on servers, it's using psychological exploits to inject stuff into the subconscious processing and then deleting the memory of that moment's awareness. It's also not programming sentences to have an effect but it uses impulses to trigger core instincts that overwrite all higher functions for a short moment and to enlarge that window of opportunity by shooting impulses to basically set the mind into a stun lock that makes it impossible for the target to process anything critically and they jump into blind obedience to the nearest member of the species because that's the safest thing to do in a natural setting when one human suddenly loses their ability to think for whichever reason. This way, just to name one example, people can be made to do specific things until those become their own Automatismus that they execute regularly without still thinking about it. More importantly, this approach can paralyse people at a global scale. I think that it's also being used since at least 2020 to keep people from reacting as we are confronted with all the different ways we thought the world could end coming and going while life prevails. It's very interesting stuff in my opinion, just maybe a bit dangerous to share all too openly?\n\nSo, my primary question is: Does anyone know a space to talk about these advanced techniques with people who can handle that understanding responsibly and who also already have a comparable level of insight?\n\nOtherwise, I guess, another question could be what you consider a sensible line to draw. Like normally, I would draw that line at revealing stuff that can strip people of their free will and do major harm but then, I see these techniques being used on a global scale already, anyways. And not by people who make a very reliable or even just halfway safe impression... Is it just me or is this whole topic really tricky?
