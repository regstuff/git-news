[\n\nRecently I have posted links to 2 repos [ and [ not because they are anything great just showing how easy it is to write some training scripts and employ the great opensource they are based on.\n\nThat you can build simple broadcast-on-wakeword sensors on lowcost esp32-s3 that use opensource low compute filters such as [ of $2 low cost analogue active mics max9814 with $2 soundcards that will run on sbc to pc.  \nOf software that is being actively ignored for 5 years that where spoken in depth on multiple times on the old Rhasspy forums and elsewhere.  \nThe OHV focus is product based that are actually inferior in use, inferior as they buy in proprietary hardware and blackbox models in preference to great opensource that has been ignored now for 5 years.  \nOpensource that should run equally well on easy maker product of low cost raspberry PiZero2 or ESP32-S2 if imported into the more supported onnx based esp-dl.\n\nQuite simply as its been mentioned on multiple times beamforming and TSE with a system that is local that requires central high compute for ARS/TTS/LLM is being ignored that state of the art beamforming and TSE (targetted speech extraction) is available as opensource and its being purposely ignored that it can run centrally and be shared by multiple cheap array sensors or single mics.\n\nVarious vendors are just pushing inferior product cloning consumer smart speakers purely with a focus of the $ duplicate redundant function can create, in a locked in form that is inferior to what opensource can do.\n\nFor 5 years its been very possible to create broadcast-on-wakeword microphones or arrays that use simple low compute filters to deliver mic streams to MVDR/TSE central processing.  \nThe products they supply are even worse as they take a 2mic array ignore the 2nd channel and with no processing feed direct into a ASR.\n\nIts so sad that a supposed leading opensource package has such poor methods and hardware that it actively promotes the big tech moat they have in terms of voice tech, as opensource is painted as inferior by product choice.  \nWe have the opensource its been available for years but what is being offered has actually gone backwards and its embarrassing for Linux to have such poor offerings such as [ when such great opensource of state of art beamforming and TSE is available and has been for many years.\n\nHA is great OHV is a snakeoil show of ignoring great opensource unless it can be refactored and rebranded as the devs own or use totally proprietary methods, developed with zero consultation or collaboration and hoisted onto the OpenSourcefoundation thats only purpose would seem to be a process to rubber stamp these totally not opensource standards as only HA uses them anyway and no-one else ever will as opensource standards.  \nThe sheer qty of standard linux audio frameworks and great opensource software ignored for sub standard proprietory python creations swap big supported herds into bottlenecks of single devs.\n\nThat the great initial focus of HA of bridging all these terrible proprietary home automation protocols into a singular opensource package seems to be running in reverse with OHV.\n\nThe closing of issues, denial and false claims, this fan based tech club that has members faking reviews and being toxic to criticism, will likely continue...  \nSadly though they can not fake the closed monolithic product offerings ignoring what caused HA to grow or its purely the devs are inept and bereft of ideas that they don't know how to employ in many cases already complete and ready to use opensource.\n\nWhat i find more annoying especially as it fits so neatly into the HA sensor mantra that broadcast-on-mic sensors spoken about many times are equally ignored for many years now even if extremely simple to employ and use cutting edge beamforming and TSE centrally of shared compute that is already required for ASR/TTS and maybe LLM.\n\nI made a decision a while back of seeing great opensource being ignored for years then see it arrive refactored and rebranded as own in SpeechToPhrase which if you have been a Voice geek dev like me really you will know its the Wenet-LM solution that got ignored even though advocated on multiple times. unfortunately its not a singular decision it is one that happens time and time and again that at least with me its decision causes so much confusion I can see only a singular reason of self interest to why its employed.\n\nI pretty much said the same on the HA forums on how simple low cost wall and ceiling sensors can use low cost Pizero2/Esp32-s3 to form cutting edge central compute MVDR &amp; TSE speech enhancement.  \nThat a voice pipeline is an end2end architecture so that endpoint ASR need to be trained with data of their input and its that simple.  \nI refuse to be involved as I am very passionate about opensource and what I am seeing is definitely damaging.  \nI don't have to do anything as I have no interest in making product especially cloned commercial e-waste.  \nEvery day great opensource is ignored, methods of simple sensors and central processing ignored in preference to badly working plastic, just paints an ever clearer picture of what is truly happening.  \nIf you are not vocal then you are complicit and everyday great opensource is ignored and simple maker product it just becomes more evident.  \nThat after such long periods the only thing that can not be ignored is that it is deliberate.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1qlxr7x/ohv_is_a_snakeoil_show/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30,000: Local Officials", "summary": "", "link": "https://time.com/nextgen-preview/7228edd7c55f97e885492382190da5ed793b2bc4232f62e28dc1fe33fca070ed/article/7357635/?utm_source=reddit.com", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mexico will continue sending oil to Cuba, Sheinbaum says", "summary": "But see also:\n\n* [Mexico weighs stopping oil shipments to Cuba amid concerns of Trump retaliation, sources say]( (Reuters)", "link": "https://www.anews.com.tr/world/2026/01/22/mexico-will-continue-sending-oil-to-cubasheinbaum-says", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Naval blockade being considered in order to halt Cuban oil imports", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-administration-weighs-naval-blockade-halt-cuban-oil-imports-politico-2026-01-23/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Senior AfD figure demands Poland pay Germany reparations for Nord Stream sabotage", "summary": "A senior figure from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has called for Poland to pay his country \u20ac1.3 billion (5.5 billion zloty) as reparations for its \u201ccomplicity\u201d in the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines.\n\nHis demand \u2013 the latest in a recent series of anti-Polish remarks by AfD figures \u2013 has been met with anger in Poland, with one government minister calling it \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kay Gottschalk, one of the founders of AfD and currently its parliamentary spokesman for financial affairs, responded on social media platform X to a post by Dominik Tarczy\u0144ski, an MEP for Poland\u2019s national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party.\n\nTarczy\u0144ski, a strong supporter of Donald Trump, celebrated that \u201cGermany today got a slap in the face from Republican forces\u201d. The context of his message was not made clear, but it may have been a reference to Trump\u2019s threat to place tariffs on Germany in relation to the Greenland crisis.\n\nGottschalk then wrote: \u201c\u20ac1.3 billion should suffice as a reparations payment for the complicity in the Nord Stream bombing. My first official act as finance minister will be to assert these claims against Poland. He who laughs last, laughs best.\u201d\n\nAfD has no immediate prospect of coming to power, with elections not due until 2029. But it is the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s parliament, and, according to polling averages, is also currently the most popular party among voters, with support of around 26%.\n\nGottschalk\u2019s reference to Nord Stream concerns the 2022 operation that saw explosives used to damage pipelines in the Baltic Sea that brought Russian gas to Germany, rendering them inoperable (though they were not functioning at that moment in any case, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine).\n\nPoland had long\u00a0[criticised Germany over the pipelines]( arguing that they helped fund Russia\u2019s war machine and harmed Polish and Ukrainian interests. Many in Poland welcomed the sabotage that damaged Nord Stream. However, there is no evidence that Poland itself was complicit.\n\nLast year, at Germany\u2019s request, the Polish authorities detained a Ukrainian man, Volodymyr Zhuravlov, accused by German prosecutors of involvement in the sabotage operation. But a Polish court\u00a0[rejected a request to extradite](\u00a0him, a decision\u00a0[praised by figures](\u00a0in both Poland\u2019s government and opposition.\n\nSome in Germany condemned Poland for its support of Zhuravlov and refusal to extradite him. Such criticism came in particular from the AfD, which has long been accused of having sympathies towards and connections with Russia.\n\nGottschalk himself at the time accused the Polish state of \u201cbeing an accomplice to terrorists\u201d. AfD\u2019s co-leader Tino Chrupalla\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that Poland was as great a threat to Germany as Russia and, as an example, pointed to the decision \u201cnot to extradite a terrorist to Germany\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Gottschalk\u2019s use of the term \u201creparations\u201d and his demand for \u20ac1.3 billion in his tweet this week was likely a reference to another area of tension between Poland and Germany.\n\nIn 2021, Poland\u2019s former PiS government\u00a0[presented a demand to Germany](\u00a0for of $1.3 trillion in reparations for World War Two. That claim\u00a0[continues to be pursued](\u00a0by PiS-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, and is\u00a0[supported by most Poles]( However, Germany argues that the case is\u00a0[legally closed](\u00a0already.\n\nGottschalk\u2019s latest remarks prompted anger in Poland. Speaking to broadcaster Polsat, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-B\u0105k, the labour minister and a member of The Left (Lewica), called them \u201cabsolutely outrageous words\u201d.\n\nThey were also criticised by Krzysztof Bosak, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), some of whose MEPs are\u00a0[part of the same group in the European Parliament](\u00a0as AfD.\n\n\u201cThe Germans claimed \\[Nord Stream\\] was a business project, not a political one. If \\[so\\], then it should have been insured, instead of complaining now and fantasising about compensation (because that\u2019s probably what they were after, not reparations),\u201d wrote Bosak.\n\nIn November last year, a local AfD activist, Fabian Keubel, also prompted widespread anger in Poland by calling Poles \u201cthe African Americans of Europe\u201d because they \u201csee themselves as the great, pitiable, perennial victim of European history\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/23/senior-afd-figure-demands-poland-pay-germany-reparations-for-nord-stream-sabotage/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland to send hundreds of generators to Ukraine amid winter heating crisis", "summary": "The Polish government is sending 379 power generators from its strategic reserves to Ukraine, where Russian attacks have left many without heat and power amid freezing winter temperatures.\n\nMeanwhile, the city of Warsaw is sending an additional 90 generators of its own to help protect Ukrainians from the winter freeze. And a\u00a0public fundraiser\u00a0in Poland to buy more generators has now received almost 7 million zloty (\u20ac1.7 million) in donations.\n\n\n\nUkrainians have been struggling to stay warm amid temperatures regularly dropping below -15\u00b0C. Currently, almost 60% of buildings in Kyiv have no electricity and a similar proportion lack heating. President Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Russia of deliberately targeting energy infrastructure to make civilians suffer.\n\nIn response, Poland announced on Friday that Prime Minister Donald Tusk has ordered the delivery of 379 electricity generators and 18 heating units from the Government Strategic Reserve Agency (RARS) to Ukraine.\n\nGovernment spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka revealed that the equipment is worth around 7 million zloty in total.

It argued that Poland had acted in violation of EU law and its actions would cause environmental damage.\n\nAs an interim measure, the CJEU\u00a0[ordered the mine to suspend operations](\u00a0for the duration of the court proceedings. Poland refused to comply, arguing that the continued operation of the mine and the nearby power plant that it supplies, which produced 7% of Poland\u2019s electricity, was crucial for energy security.\n\nAs a result, the CJEU in September 2021\u00a0[ordered](\u00a0Poland to begin paying daily fines of \u20ac500,000 until it complied. Poland then refused to pay those fines, leading the European Commission to\u00a0[deduct the money]( \u20ac68.5 million in total, from Poland\u2019s EU funds.\n\nIn 2022, after it had\u00a0[reached an agreement](\u00a0with the Czech Republic to end the dispute over the mine, Poland launched a complaint to the CJEU against the European Commission\u2019s actions.\n\nIt argued that the agreement with Prague meant the fines could be cancelled retroactively and that the commission\u2019s decision to deduct the money was therefore unlawful. The fines had been issued before the agreement with Prague, but the commission took the money after the agreement had been reached.\n\nIn 2024, one part of the CJEU, known as the General Court,\u00a0[rejected Poland\u2019s complaint]( It found that the removal of the case from the court\u2019s register following the settlement with the Czech Republic did not relieve Poland of the obligation to settle the fines already accrued.\n\nAlthough the case had originally been brought by Poland\u2019s former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, which ruled until December 2023 and regularly clashed with Brussels, its current more pro-EU government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, still decided to appeal the ruling.\n\nThat appeal was heard by the European Court of Justice, which is the second part of the CJEU. In a ruling issued on Thursday, the ECJ rejected Poland\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe obligation to pay the daily penalty\u2026is intended to ensure compliance with the interim measures already ordered, to preserve the full effectiveness of the future final decision, and thus to guarantee the effective application of EU law in the general interest,\u201d wrote the court.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the parties to the dispute, including the conclusion of a settlement agreement, cannot have the effect of retroactively varying, annulling or setting aside an order imposing such a periodic penalty payment,\u201d it added.\n\nAt the time of writing, Poland\u2019s government had not yet commented on the ruling. However, Anna Zalewska, a former PiS government minister and now member of the European Parliament, used it as an opportunity to criticise European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n\u201cThe European Commission does not intend to return to Poland the \u20ac68 million in fines for refusing to suspend coal mining at the\u00a0Tur\u00f3w\u00a0mine,\u201d wrote Zalewska on social media. \u201cThe reasons for removing von der Leyen \\[from her position\\] are increasing day by day.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/22/eu-court-rejects-polands-appeal-against-e68-5-million-coal-mine-fines-2/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
