It wasn\u2019t made to compete with anything; it just solved problems I had at the time, long before libraries like Vercel AI SDK became as full-featured (or popular) as it is now. I finally cleaned it up enough to share (although it definitely would have been better positioned if I had done so earlier).\n\nGitHub: [  \nDemo (needs your own LLM key): [\n\nIt\u2019s a small SDK that allows me to interact with various LLM providers and handle text, images, and audio through a single generate or stream call. There\u2019s also a super-simple \u201cagent\u201d layer that\u2019s basically a for-loop; no hidden prompts, no weird parsing. I never clicked with fancier primitives like \u201cChain\u201d or \u201cGraph\u201d (maybe a skill issue, but I just don\u2019t find them easy to grasp, pun intended).\n\nWhat I like about it:\n\n* One call for any modality, text, image, audio, so I don\u2019t have to guess what a user might ask for.\n* Each output \u201cPart\u201d includes helpful details (image width/height, audio encoding/channel/format, etc.) so the client can show or stream it correctly. Most libraries just give a generic \u201cFilePart\u201d with almost no metadata. The library is missing some other parts like Video and Document at the moment, but I\u2019ll add them soon.\n* Same serialization across JS, Go, and Rust, handy for mixed backends.\n* Suitable for web application usage. Reuse the same agent for different requests from different users, tenants by including a context object\n* Tracks token usage and cost out of the box.\n\nOther tools like Vercel AI SDK only have fixed methods generateText for text only, and most \u201cAI gateway\u201d setups still revolve around OpenAI\u2019s text-first Chat Completion API, so multi-modal support feels bolted on. This code predates those libraries and just stuck around because it works for me, those other libraries have plenty of value on their own.\n\nThe library is very primitive and doesn\u2019t provide the plug-and-play experience others do, so it might not suit everyone, but it can still be used to build powerful agent patterns (e.g., Memory, Human-in-the-loop) or practical features like Artifacts. I have some examples in the docs.
