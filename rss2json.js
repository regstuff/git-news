Only 60 were opposed to the motion, including MEPs from Poland\u2019s opposition national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, reports news website Onet.\n\nThe request to lift Braun\u2019s immunity was filed in June this year by Poland\u2019s then justice minister and prosecutor general, Adam Bodnar, who said that Polish prosecutors wanted to charge the far-right leader with six alleged crimes.\n\nFour of them relate to an incident in April when Braun entered a hospital and contronfed a gynacologist who had been\u00a0[involved a late-term abortion](\u00a0that had drawn controversy and condemnation from right-wing groups.\n\nBraun is accused of deprivation of liberty (for preventing the doctor from leaving her office), violating the doctor\u2019s bodily integrity (by pushing her and holding her down) as well as insulting and slandering her.\n\n\n\nThe fifth charge Braun is now facing stems from an infamous incident in December 2023, when he\u00a0[attacked a Jewish Hanukkah celebration](\u00a0in parliament, putting out the candles with a fire extinguisher.\n\nBraun has already been\u00a0[stripped of immunity](\u00a0[charged](\u00a0and\u00a0[indicted](\u00a0in relation to the incident itself.
