Most popular LLM frameworks for extracting structured data from documents require extensive boilerplate code to extract even basic information. This significantly increases development time and complexity.\n\nContextGem addresses this challenge by providing a flexible, intuitive framework that extracts structured data and insights from documents with minimal effort. Complex, most time-consuming parts, - prompt engineering, data modelling and validators, grouped LLMs with role-specific tasks, neural segmentation, etc. - are handled with powerful abstractions, eliminating boilerplate code and reducing development overhead.\n\nContextGem leverages LLMs' long context windows to deliver superior accuracy for data extraction from individual documents. Unlike RAG approaches that often struggle with complex concepts and nuanced insights, ContextGem capitalizes on continuously expanding context capacity, evolving LLM capabilities, and decreasing costs.\n\nCheck it out on GitHub: [\n\nIf you are a Python developer, please try it! Your feedback would be much appreciated! And if you like the project, please give it a \u2b50 to help it grow.
