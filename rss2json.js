Nonetheless, the conservative camp still appears on track to win a majority at the next election if the president can help reconstruct the broad alliance that secured his victory.\n\n# Emboldening the opposition\n\nIn December 2023, a coalition government headed up by liberal-centrist Civic Coalition (KO) leader Donald Tusk took office following eight years rule by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, currently the main opposition grouping.\n\nHowever, the\u00a0[surprise victory](\u00a0of PiS-backed candidate Karol Nawrocki in the May-June presidential election scuppered the Tusk administration\u2019s plans to align all branches of state power so that it could push through its policy agenda and elite replacement programme.\n\nThe government lacks the three-fifths parliamentary majority required to overturn a presidential veto, so faces continued resistance from a hostile president who can effectively block many of its key reforms for the remainder of its term of office, which is scheduled to run until the next election in autumn 2027.\n\nJust as importantly, Nawrocki\u2019s victory transformed Poland\u2019s political dynamics, as a result of which the governing coalition found itself severely weakened and on the defensive. The election was widely seen as, above all, a referendum on the Tusk government and opportunity to channel discontent with the failure to deliver on policy pledges that helped bring it to power.\n\nThis feeling of a radically new political landscape was reinforced when Nawrocki took office in August and it became clear that he would be an assertive president keen to carve out a role for himself as an independent actor. With a\u00a0[blaze of presidential vetoes](\u00a0and legislative and foreign policy initiatives, Nawrocki quickly became Poland\u2019s most popular politician.\n\nAt the same time, it was also obvious that the government was, initially at least, completely unprepared for his victory, raising the possibility of an early election. As a consequence, Nawrocki\u2019s victory also emboldened the right-wing opposition, which saw it as a pivotal moment providing a clear pathway to regaining full power following an inevitable victory at the next parliamentary election.\n\n# Turning in on itself\n\nIn fact, the Tusk government\u00a0[stabilised its position and launched a counter-offensive](\u00a0to shift the political dynamics back in its favour. At the same time, although Nawrocki\u2019s election-winning coalition successfully brought together supporters of various right-wing political groupings, since then they have increasingly turned on each other.\n\nIn particular, relations between the two leading right-wing parties \u2013 PiS and the radical right free-market Confederation (Konfederacja), whose presidential candidate S\u0142awomir Mentzen finished a strong third with 14.8% of the first round votes \u2013 have become increasingly strained.\n\nPiS was politically re-energised but also became extremely complacent, interpreting Nawrocki\u2019s victory as a signal that it was capable of winning the next parliamentary election on its own. The party started to focus its fire increasingly on Confederation rather than the government, issuing a challenge for Mentzen to rule out a future coalition with Tusk.\n\nConfederation refused to do this as it would undermine its identity as an anti-establishment grouping that views both main parties as two sides of the same corrupt \u201cduopoly\u201d. Mentzen responded by calling PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski a liar, boor and political gangster; although other Confederation leaders, notably Krzysztof Bosak, leader of its nationalist wing, were much more restrained.\n\nMoreover, the emergence in October of a high-profile corruption probe into a\u00a0[suspicious sale of strategic state-owned land](\u00a0designated for the planned Central Communication Port (CPK) \u201cmega-airport\u201d and transport hub, one of the PiS government\u2019s flagship infrastructure projects, to a private entity for a fraction of its market value shortly before it left office in 2023 was very damaging for the party.\n\nThis was followed by the\u00a0[laying of 26 criminal charges](\u00a0against former PiS justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who was accused of leading an \u201corganised criminal group\u201d that allegedly misused around 150 million zloty (*\u20ac*35.5 million) from the so-called Justice Fund (designed to assist victims of crime) for political patronage and unlawfully financing the purchase of the Pegasus spyware system.\n\nAlthough criticised by government opponents as a politically motivated witch hunt or displacement activity, this completely overshadowed a PiS programmatic convention meant to launch the party\u2019s autumn political offensive. It also gave the Tusk administration tangible examples to underpin its narrative that the previous government was corrupt and misused state power.\n\nAccording to the Politico Europe aggregator of Polish opinion polls, PiS saw its support drop from 31% in June to 28% in December, falling behind KO, which is currently averaging 34%.\n\n# Different social bases\n\nApart from letting the Tusk government off the hook, the two right-wing groupings\u2019 political strategies were both based on false premises.\n\nOn the one hand, following Nawrocki\u2019s victory PiS appeared to believe that, by portraying Confederation as a potential future collaborator with Tusk, it could alienate the party from its \u201canti-system\u201d base, and tap into voter disillusionment with the government to secure the 40% vote threshold traditionally needed to win an outright majority.\n\nConfederation, on the other hand, believed that, by presenting the KO-PiS duopoly as two sides of the same stagnant establishment and positioning itself as the only truly \u201canti-system\u201d alternative, it could replace PiS as the dominant force on the Polish right.\n\nIn both cases, this ignores the fact that the two parties appeal to very different social constituencies, reflected in their varying approaches to socio-economic policy.\n\nPiS relies heavily on less well-off, less well-educated, older voters living in rural areas and smaller towns, who are also more socially and culturally conservative and religiously devout. These voters typically favour large-scale fiscal transfers and social welfare programmes.\n\nConfederation, on the other hand, enjoys particularly high levels of\u00a0[support among younger voters](\u00a0who generally view PiS as a part of the stagnant \u201cold guard\u201d duopoly. These voters often feel frustrated with the apparent \u201cglass ceiling\u201d of vested interests and corrupt networks that stifles opportunities for them, and do not see state support and social spending as the solution to their problems but rather favour radical free-market economics.\n\nConfederation\u2019s younger voters tend to be more secular and quite socially liberally, although they also often see the \u201cwoke\u201d left as a greater threat to their personal freedom than the religious right.\n\n# PiS increasingly divided\n\nOn top of that, PiS\u2019s internal cohesion, and possibly even survival as a unitary political grouping, is threatened by increasingly bitter open factional divisions. These conflicts have been a constant feature of PiS but have become more public and pronounced as a result of the progressive weakening of Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s authority as party leader.\n\nKaczy\u0144ski has been the crucial key source of unity within PiS as the ultimate arbiter balancing power between the rival camps. However, although his leadership remains unquestioned, Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s influence is steadily weakening and the party splitting into several competing camps.\n\nThe more hardline-conservative faction grouped around MEP\u00a0[Tobiasz Boche\u0144ski](\u00a0(often referred to in the Polish media humorously as the\u00a0*ma\u015blarze*\u00a0or \u201cbutter-makers\u201d) has gained significant momentum in recent months, being given control of the party\u2019s 2027 parliamentary election programme.\n\nThis faction is more Eurosceptic and advocates a more right-wing agenda that includes pushing ahead with radical state reconstruction and promoting a conservative vision of national identity and traditional values. Politicians previously linked to Sovereign Poland (SP), a small hardline right-wing conservative party led by Ziobro which was\u00a0[formally re-integrated into PiS](\u00a0last year, are also aligned with this faction.\n\nThe modernising-technocratic wing led by former prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki also have strong conservative values and have at times been very critical of Poland\u2019s post-1989 establishment, but emphasise economic competence and boosting Polish prosperity as a more effective way of appealing to voters less influenced by traditional institutions such as the Catholic church.\n\nAlthough at one point Kaczy\u0144ski backed Morawiecki, viewing him as better equipped to deliver socio-economic success and manage international relations, this faction has become increasingly marginalised.\n\nAlthough Morawiecki and his supporters publicly maintain their loyalty to the party, the tension between the two factions has become so severe that some insiders suggest they are working actively towards each other\u2019s marginalisation or exclusion ahead of the next election.\n\n# The rise of Grzegorz Braun\n\nAnother factor significantly complicating efforts to unite the Polish right has been the[\u00a0rise of the Confederation of the Polish Crown](\u00a0(KPP) led by Grzegorz Braun, who was expelled from the main Confederation alliance in January.\n\nBraun\u2019s splinter party has surged since his unexpected fourth place in the presidential election with 6.3%, notably picking up the support of many disillusioned former PiS voters. According to Politico Europe, it is averaging 8% compared with 12% for Mentzen\u2019s grouping, and in some polls even overtaking it, demonstrating a growing public appetite for even more radical right-wing anti-establishment stances.\n\nBraun\u2019s platform encompasses:\u00a0[opposing](\u00a0the so-called \u201cUkrainisation\u201d of Poland, anti-Jewish stances including\u00a0[claims](\u00a0that the current Auschwitz gas chambers are fake, radical anti-EU rhetoric that goes well beyond PiS\u2019s anti-federalism, and sometimes violent provocations such as\u00a0[attacking a Hanukkah celebration](\u00a0in parliament.\n\nBut while this appeals to a specific radicalised core electoral base, it is viewed as toxic by more moderate conservative and centrist Poles.\n\nThe problem for the Polish right is that currently it cannot return to power without Braun\u2019s party\u2019s support. However, his radical policies and actions mean that any hint of a formal alliance will be leveraged by the Tusk government to discredit the entire conservative camp as unfit for office.\n\nA possible link-up with Braun\u2019s party could, for example, emerge as an issue around whether to agree a unified right-wing electoral front for the Senate, Poland\u2019s less powerful second parliamentary chamber. The Senate is elected by the first-past-the-post system that favours large, unified electoral blocs such as the \u201c[Senate pact]( (*pakt senacki*) that helped the current ruling coalition secure a majority.\n\nMany commentators argue that a key factor explaining why Braun has picked up former PiS voters is that the party has not atoned sufficiently for its perceived strategic and moral errors during its period of office.\n\nThese, they argue, include: surrendering too much sovereignty to the EU, failing to advance Polish interests sufficiently in relations with Ukraine, focusing too much on securing short-term political control rather than building durable reformed institutions in areas such as the judiciary, and turning into a \u201cnew elite\u201d that forgot its anti-system roots.\n\nIndeed, in many ways the presidential election result masked the fact that Nawrocki\u2019s 29.5% of first-round votes was actually less than the 35.4% PiS secured in the 2023 parliamentary election and the party\u2019s lowest vote share for 20 years.\n\n# Nawrocki is the key?\n\nNonetheless, in spite of its post-presidential election drift, recent projections suggest that, overall, the right-wing camp still appears most likely to win a majority of seats in the new parliament because the smaller governing coalition partners are struggling to cross the electoral representation threshold.\n\nMoreover, combining social welfare commitments with a harder line on Ukraine and more pronounced Euroscepticism, Nawrocki demonstrated a formula for attracting those right-wing voters who reject PiS, capturing around 90% of both Mentzen and Braun\u2019s first-round voters.\n\nAlthough he was PiS\u2019s presidential candidate, Nawrocki operates as an independent authority outside of Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s direct control, and, some argue, is actually ideologically closer to Confederation.\n\nAs a figure who straddles the broad right-wing camp, Nawrocki is thus potentially the key figure who can reconstruct the broad, election-winning right-wing coalition that he brought together so successfully in the presidential run-off.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/29/why-has-polands-right-wing-opposition-lost-momentum/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Leader of movement \u201cdefending Polish border\u201d from German migrant transfers to stand trial", "summary": "The nationalist leader of a self-proclaimed Border Defence Movement (ROG), which emerged last year to oppose Germany\u2019s policy of returning migrants that had entered illegally from Poland, is to stand trial.\n\nProsecutors have indicted Robert B\u0105kiewicz on various criminal charges, including insulting Polish border officers and inciting hatred against Germans and immigrants.

In their statement, prosecutors said that B\u0105kiewicz had not admitted to any of the crimes he is accused of and had exercised his right to remain silent.\n\nHowever, speaking to conservative news website Niezale\u017cna, B\u0105kiewicz declared that prosecutors\u2019 actions against him were an act of \u201cpolitical revenge\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey know that we have awakened millions of Poles on the issue of resistance to mass migration, and I hope this resistance will be even stronger,\u201d he continued. \u201cThese false accusations, the entire hypocrisy of prosecutors and the criminals who cooperate with them, will be judged and punished.
