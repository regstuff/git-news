The idea is to find the feelings behind a message through the language used. To do this I figured a LLM model would work best as there can be a lot a nuance in the sentences that might go unnoticed. However a major problem I ran into is that many of the data repositories out there do not focus on the emotional aspect. The NLTK movies library only has positive/negative reviews. I did find the crowd sourced [NRC Emotion Lexicon]( which contains the data of interest; but this is all unigrams and not sentences. \n\nmy first impression was to use current tools like the module Nrclex to map to the movie reviews data but I quickly found that Nrclex is really just tallying the non-stopwords present (\"not happy\" == \"happy\" as not is not tallied). \n\n  \nSo now I am looking to update Nrclex to include pos\\_tag data about the adjacent words. However this seems to be the only half of the problem as adverbs and adjectives can differ in modifying the meaning of a word. \"very happy\" and \"not happy\" both change the meaning of happy where \"not\" flips the meaning and \"very\" changes the magnitude. I need to know the spin of the word before I can start implementing a modifier for the emotional data to output the correct response.\n\n  \nand this is all in the effort to enhance the movies reviews for with the emotional data to build an LLM to quantify the emotional information found in a text.\n\n\n\nSo right now I am trying to figure out how to generate the enhance/invert information for the adverbs and adjectives. Sentiment analysis won't work as words like \"not\" and \"none\" have no sentiment, and this isn't really the type of data that can be used for inverting a word meaning. I thought about using it for adverbs as words like \"smartly\" do have sentiment but this only addresses the enhance side of the issue.\n\n  \nIs there a data repository that contains this type of data? Does this make sense what I am thinking? Is there an easier method I may be missing?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1g6bo31/discussion_about_building_an_emotion_classifier/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Most famous Scythian silver Amphora/Vase from Chertomlyk Royal Kurgan in Ukraine. 4th c.

Believed to have been built sometime around 1870-1888 for owner E.A. Gibbs, it was originally located at 709 Meridian and is quite possibly the oldest surviving frame residence in South Pasadena.\n \nBy the time it was being used to film 1978\u2019s Halloween, the house was in fairly rough shape. It was being used to store wheelchairs by the nearby hospital and has such had not been properly taken care of. Yet it was that very state that likely drew the film crew to the home, leading to it becoming a leading lady in the ultimately $70 million dollar box office success and long-lasting franchise.\n \nDevelopment ultimately threatened the structure in 1987. In total, seven homes were designated to be torn down, with the Century House the last one scheduled to be taken down. However, as the story goes, longtime Council Member, Submarine Veteran and \u201cThe Plumber Who Outwitted the IRS\u201d David Margrave rushed up to the bulldozer driver just as the dozer was about to give it a push. He managed to get into contact with then current owner Dr. Joseph Kohn and, with a silver dollar, purchased the home on the condition that he needed to move the house within a week. A task too large for just one person, he called upon the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation to help him save the historic home.\n \nIn a December 28th, 1987 letter, the foundation wrote to the Santa Fe Railroad with a request to lease the plot of land at 1000 Mission street, citing the historic value of the home, the support of the city, as well as showing that the home would not endanger the railroad\u2019s operations. Suffice to say the effort was successful and the home was moved down the street onto the triangular plot of land where it still stands today, with the property later being purchased outright.\n \nThe foundation would additionally successfully advocate for the changing of boundaries of the South Pasadena National Historic Business District to include the plot of land where the house was moved to, and, with further support of the Cultural Heritage Commission, established the home as South Pasadena Landmark #34. The request to have the home called the \u201cCentennial House\u201d by the CHC and the SPPF was rejected in favor of the \u201cCentury House\u201d\n \nIncluded alongside the historical images of the home, are some of the documents that go along with the story of saving the home. Documents and Images like these, along with several artifacts and other items related to the history of South Pasadena are available for viewing for any kind of research, from a high school essay, a YouTube video, a graduate school thesis, or even just someone who is curious about the history and perhaps has never gotten the chance to experience a museum archive. Appointments to see the archives can be arranged by emailing the Archivist + at sppfarchive@gmail.com (main floor of the SPPF museum is open to the public every Thursday from 4pm-8pm at 913 Meridian Ave).\n \nStill today, 46 years after Halloween put the home into the pages of Hollywood history, the home still attracts visitors from around the globe. The efforts made by David Margrave and the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation served to keep the leading lady standing and looking better than ever. One must wonder if Michael might think \u201cya know this was my childhood home but it\u2019s like too nice now, Ima go find another\u201d.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6eujm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "CRM jobs in Quebec", "summary": "I've worked in BC archaeology for 11 years and am interested in meeting anyone who does this work in Quebec.

Although I don\u2019t know if I want to be a professor, I really like school and want to be the best at my job. The only reason I don\u2019t want to is because I don\u2019t want to live in the same place for sooooo many years. So tell me: \n\nIs there a place on earth where I can specialize in spatial analysis of cemeteries for grad school? Bc I can\u2019t find it anywhere online. I\u2019m even willing to go abroad. \n\nIf I did a PhD, do I really have to live full time in whatever city for that long? (This is why I said I\u2019m first gen college bc I don\u2019t understand this shit)\n\nDo you think it\u2019s possible to do a grad program and CRM at the same time? Do I need another job that\u2019s easier to schedule in between classes? Like how the heck do you make money while doing all that\u2019s school, and for so long!!\n\nThank you in advance for any tips and sorry for a rant that\u2019s probably the most basic questions \ud83e\udd72\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1g65yw0/gis_of_cemeterieswhat_do_i_do_with_my_career_grad/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Real Archaeology", "summary": "Hey all, a big group of us are putting on a big online festival: #RealArchaeology.
