Relevancy - post must be related to Natural Language Processing.\n5. LLM Question Rules - Questions about hardware, custom LLM model development (as in, training a 40B model from scratch), and cloud deployment architectures are probably skewing towards the scope of r/LocalLLaMA or r/RAG.\n6. ~~Questions about Linguistics, Compling, and general university program comparison are better directed elsewhere.~~ As pointed out in the comments, r/compling seems to be dead. Scrapping this one.\n\nThanks for reading.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1g3ssee/rlanguagetechnology_is_under_new_management_call/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anti-Zionist beliefs \u2018worthy of respect\u2019, UK tribunal finds", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/14/anti-zionist-beliefs-worthy-respect-uk-tribunal-finds-israel", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France\u2019s far-right leader Marine Le Pen faces court on charges of embezzling EU funds", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/france-lepen-trial-embezzling-funds-far-right-11fa6157c6897d2c9ffe9e7d11984905", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Afghan Taliban bans all images of living things", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/14/taliban-bans-all-images-of-living-things/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "18 North Korean Soldiers Have Reportedly Fled Russian Positions Towards Border", "summary": "", "link": "https://united24media.com/latest-news/18-north-korean-soldiers-have-reportedly-fled-russian-positions-towards-border-3022", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada and \u0406ndia expel each other's diplomats in escalating dispute over a 2023 assassination", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/india-recalls-ambassador-canada-growing-145120043.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India tells US \u2018CC1\u2019 arrested as team heads to Washington", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tells-us-cc1-arrested-as-team-heads-to-washington-101728933357929-amp.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh restricts Durga Puja celebrations, organisers asked to pay \u2018jizya\u2019 tax, maintain silence during Namaaz ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/bangladesh-restricts-durga-puja-celebrations-organisers-asked-to-pay-jizya-tax-maintain-silence-during-namaaz-11727949101649.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Taylor Swift, Dolly Parton and Metallica Among Celebs Who Have Raised Over $8 Million in Hurricane Aid", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.tvfandomlounge.com/taylor-swift-dolly-parton-and-metallica-among-celebs-raising-over-8-million-in-hurricane-aid/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adobe unveils Firefly AI video model and showcases new AI-powered Photoshop features", "summary": "1/ Adobe unveiled new AI capabilities at its MAX conference, including a text-to-video model called Firefly Video and enhanced AI tools for Photoshop, including Remove, Generative Fill, Generative Expand, Generate Similar, and Generate Background.\r\n\r\n2/ The Firefly Video model allows users to create videos or modify existing footage using text and image prompts that specify aspects such as camera settings, lighting, colors, and mood.\r\n\r\n3/ The new AI features are available now in Photoshop, Photoshop Beta, and Photoshop on the web, while interested users can join a waiting list for the Firefly Video model.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1g3jdpf/adobe_unveils_firefly_ai_video_model_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tomb planning", "summary": "This is for the archaologists out there who have experience in extremelly arid climates.\n\nI wish to have a tomb constructed for myself that will contain the story of my life, in several languages laser etched in stone.
