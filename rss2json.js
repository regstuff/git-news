After tweaking a few settings, I've gotten the LLM to think for up to 29 seconds and refer to a few hundred documents. I'm typically changing num\\_ctx, max\\_tokens and top\\_k. EDIT: This result is better, but I think I can do even better. \n\n* OWUI is connected to Ollama.\n* I have verified that the model I'm using (gpt-oss) has a context length set to 131072 tokens in Ollama itself.\n* Admin Panel &gt; Settings &gt; Documents: Top K = 500\n* Admin Panel &gt; Settings &gt; Models&gt; gpt-oss:20b: max\\_tokens = 128000, num\\_ctx (Ollama) = 128000.\n* New Chat &gt; Controls &gt; Advanced Params: top k = 500, max\\_tokens = 128000, num\\_ctx (Ollama) = 128000.\n* Hardware: Desktop PC w/GPU and lots of RAM (plenty of resources).\n\nDo you have any advice about tweaking settings to work with RAG, documents, collections, etc?
