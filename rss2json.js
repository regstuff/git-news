The most recent is from Wednesday this week.\n\nHowever, he has previously had other accounts on the platform with higher numbers of followers. But they were then blocked by TikTok, according to Demagag, a Polish fact-checking service.\n\nBoth Demagog and\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*, a leading Polish daily, report that the man is called Dariusz M. (with his surname masked under Polish privacy law) and previously served in the 6th Logistics Battalion and 2nd Reconnaissance Regiment of the Polish army.\n\nHe joined Russian forces in 2023, first as a volunteer then later as a soldier after receiving Russian citizenship.\n\nIn one of his videos, Dariusz M. said that he wants Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cspecial operation\u201d in Ukraine \u201cto reach Poland and put things in order\u201d. He referred to the European Union as the \u201cFourth Reich\u201d and condemned Poland\u2019s \u201ctraitorous government\u201d.\n\nHe has also encouraged Poles to join the Russian military and asked them to take photos of any military transports they see passing through Poland to Ukraine, reports\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*, which says that some of the videos on his earlier accounts garnered millions of views.\n\nIn their statement, the district prosecutor\u2019s office reported that Krak\u00f3w\u2019s district court has agreed to their request to issue an arrest warrant for the suspect. However, they noted that he is \u201ccurrently probably staying in the territory\u00a0of Russia\u201d. That makes it highly unlikely that he will face justice\n\nIf convicted, the crimes he is accused of carry potential prison sentences of up to eight years (for spreading disinformation on behalf of foreign intelligence) and up to five years (for serving in a foreign military)\n\nIn 2021, an active Polish soldier, Emil Czeczko,\u00a0[crossed the border to Belarus]( where he claimed asylum and later\u00a0[appeared on state TV]( making unfounded accusations against Poland. The following year, Belarusian authorities announced that he had been found dead by hanging at his home in Belarus.\n\nPoland has in recent years detained, charged, and in some cases\u00a0[convicted](\u00a0dozens of agents accused of conducting espionage, sabotage, disinformation and other so-called \u201chybrid actions\u201d on behalf of Russia.\n\nEarlier this month, Polish prosecutors\u00a0[indicted five people](\u00a0\u2013 four Ukrainian citizens and one Russian \u2013 accused of carrying out a plot on behalf of Russia to plant\u00a0explosives in packages that were then dispatched by courier services across Europe.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/29/poland-issues-warrant-for-soldier-accused-of-joining-russian-army-and-spreading-disinformation-on-tiktok/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Very masculinist\u2019: how Iran unrest felt different to 2022\u2019s hijab protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/29/very-masculinist-how-iran-unrest-different-2022-hijab-protests", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nigerian Muslims Won\u2019t Recognise Elections Conducted By INEC Chairman Amupitan, The Supreme Council for Shari\u2019ah in Nigeria (SCSN), Declares", "summary": "", "link": "https://guardian.ng/news/muslims-will-not-recognise-any-election-conducted-by-amupitan-sharia-council/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Portugal builds Europe's first dedicated drone carrier, D Jo\u00e3o II", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/2026/01/29/portugal-builds-europes-first-dedicated-drone-carrier-d-joao-ii", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish foreign minister calls for creation of \u201cEuropean legion\u201d", "summary": "Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, has proposed the creation of a \u201cEuropean legion\u201d, which would be made up of soldiers from European Union member states and even countries that are candidates to join the EU.\n\nHe argues that forming such a force would be more realistic than the idea of creating a full European army, as was recently advocated by EU defence commissioner Andrius Kubilius.\n\n\u201cTalking about a federal army is pointless, because it is unrealistic, because national armies will not merge,\u201d Sikorski told the press ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels\n\n\u201cHowever, we could create what I call a European legion, initially a brigade-sized unit, which could be joined by citizens of member states and perhaps even candidate states,\u201d he added.\n\nSuch a legion would be financed from the EU budget and \u201cpolitically subordinate to the \\[EU\u2019s\\] Political and Security Committee\u201d, said Sikorski.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a force capable of deterring Putin, but there are lower-level threats, such as those in North Africa or the Balkans, where we should have the ability to act together,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU currently does not have its own army, but most member states\u00a0 \u2013 23 out of 27 \u2013 are part of the NATO military alliance. However, the recent dispute with President Donald Trump over Greenland has raised questions about the extent to which Europe can rely on the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, the EU\u2019s defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, said the bloc should consider establishing a 100,000-strong military force of its own.\n\nHowever, ahead of today\u2019s summit, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas questioned the feasibility of that idea, saying that she \u201ccannot\u00a0imagine that countries will create a separate European army\u201d given that they are already part of NATO and have their own national militaries.\n\n\u201cIf we create parallel structures, then it is just going to blur the picture,\u201d said Kallas. Similarly, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said earlier this week that a European army would \u201cmake things more complicated\u201d and result in \u201ca lot of duplication\u201d, reported Reuters.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has rapidly ramped up its defence spending, which will\u00a0[reach 4.8% of GDP this year]( the\u00a0[highest relative level in NATO]( It has also pushed for other members of the alliance to increase their defence budgets.\n\nBy 2024, Poland had\u00a0[NATO\u2019s third-largest military](\u00a0in terms of personnel, behind only the United States and Turkey. By 2030, it will have\u00a0[more tanks](\u00a0than Germany, France, the UK and Italy combined.\n\nMost of Poland\u2019s defence procurement has, however, taken place outside Europe, with the majority of new equipment purchased from the\u00a0[United States](\u00a0and\u00a0[South Korea](", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/29/polish-foreign-minister-calls-for-creation-of-european-legion/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Africa\u2019s two biggest economies may be turning the corner\nAs Nigeria and South Africa revive, the continent\u2019s growth may outpace Asia\u2019s in 2026", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2026/01/29/africas-two-biggest-economies-may-be-turning-the-corner?utm_campaign=shared_article", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
