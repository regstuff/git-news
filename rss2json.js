India kept preventive detention provisions in the Constitution itself and Egypt has been under emergency law almost continuously since 1952. Neither of these laws were created to fight global terrorism, rather they were tools to manage internal dissent and territorial sovereignty anxieties.\n\nBut post-9/11, the international understanding on threat perception and response shifted, UN Security Council Resolution 1373 in 2001 demanded all states adopt preventive counterterrorism legislation. Suddenly there's a global norm that says having expansive security laws makes you a responsible member of the international community, not an authoritarian outlier giving legitimacy to our laws that hinder personal liberties. \n\nFor India, this timing was perfectm, BJP had already laid groundwork on building political campaigns around \"Islamic terrorism\" since the 1990s, focusing on Kashmir insurgency and immigration from Bangladesh. When the global discourse shifted to the War on Terror with explicit focus on Islamic extremism, India's domestic security narrative suddenly aligned with international priorities.\n\nThe study points out that when India passed POTA in 2002, it was framed differently than earlier anti-terror laws. Previous legislation like TADA in the 1980s was justified as response to domestic problems like Punjab insurgency, but POTA was explicitly framed as necessitated by cross-border terrorist activities and the emergence of global terrorism, framing in lines of international priorities. \n\nThis did not stop thereafter and Prime Minister Modi to date continues this pattern and the researchers note his speeches consistently invoke terrorism as a \"global\" threat requiring strong, united response from India, also helps us pin blame on Pakistan and leverage whatever tool we have in our arsenal against them. \n\nMore interesting stuff in the study is how in Egypt similar dynamics play out in a Muslim-majority country. Egypt also used post-9/11 counterterrorism norms to gain international legitimacy for cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood, its main political rival. President El-Sisi literally cited the need to regain the rule of law when passing counterterrorism legislation in 2015, even as those laws enabled mass arrests and disappearances.\n\nBoth countries are doing the same dance that is using domestic counterterrorism laws for suppressing opposition,  and maintaining control over restive regions. The geopolitical advantage is significant, when India faces international criticism over Kashmir or treatment of minorities, it can frame its actions within counterterrorism discourse that has global legitimacy. When activists or journalists get charged under UAPA, the government can claim it's following international best practices in preventing terrorism, not suppressing dissent.\n\nThe study argues that colonial logics embedded in the international system provide justification for violence under new guises which in simple words means that the very concept of statehood, sovereignty, and legitimate security practices that structure international relations emerged from European colonial powers' own methods. When postcolonial states replicate those methods, they're not deviating from international norms rather they are conforming to them.\n\nThis is where comparing with Egypt becomes valuable for understanding India's position. Egypt isn't trying to be a democratic model, it doesn't even try, It's openly authoritarian. Yet it faces relatively limited international pushback on its counterterrorism excesses because those fit within acceptable frameworks of state security.\n\nIndia's position is different because we happen to be world's largest democracy but our credentials do take a hit when we use colonial era security frameworks to manage domestic opposition, like we still haves sedition in our books, bit toned down but then again we did charge Asseem Trivedi  with sedition for a cartoon.\n\nThe question for India's geopolitical positioning is whether this tension is sustainable. Can you maintain international legitimacy as the world's largest democracy while using colonial-era security frameworks to manage domestic opposition? So far, the answer seems to be yes, largely because counterterrorism provides acceptable framing.\n\nBut there are costs and the study documents how UAPA gets applied to activists, students, journalists, people at public meetings. When Dalit activists commemorating a historical battle get charged with terrorism, when students protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act face UAPA charges, it creates a gap between India's democratic brand and domestic reality.\n\nFrom a pure realist perspective, this gap doesn't matter as long as India remains strategically valuable to major powers. But if we think soft power and democratic credentials have geopolitical value, particularly in competing with China for influence in the Global South, then the domestic application of counterterrorism laws could become a foreign policy liability. Especially with muslim majority countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Maldives as immediate neigbhours and much of middle east who see Pakistan as a Muslim country but not India, despite India having a greater population of Muslims. \n\nLink to study if interested - [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1o74nk0/how_911_gave_indias_domestic_security_state/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Training Qwen 3VL 8b thinking", "summary": "Hey guys just had a question i wanted to train qwen3 VL 8b thinking on the dataset i trained qwen 2.5VL 7b. \n\nIs it necessary to have a thinking part on the 3VL ?
