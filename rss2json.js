Because of renovation works at Schloss Gottorf in Germany, several of their famous bog bodies are being sent on loan to Denmark. Starting this month five of the best preserved bog bodies from Schleswig-Holstein will be exhibited in Silkeborg at the museum where the Tollund Man is kept.\nMost of the bog bodies in this assemblage date to the Iron Age, roughly between 500 BCE and 200 CE. They come from peat bogs in northern Germany and Denmark where the waterlogged, oxygen-poor, and acidic conditions preserved skin, hair, and even clothing. Many show signs of violent deaths or ritual killings, suggesting they were deposited deliberately rather than buried in the usual way. \n\nThe exhibition is called \u201cMoorleichen auf Reisen\u201d (Bog Bodies on the Move), and it brings together remains from both Germany and Denmark. Some of these bodies still have hair, skin and even bits of clothing, thanks to the peat bog chemistry that naturally mummified them.\n\nAmong the ones on loan are the Child of Windeby, the man from Rendsw\u00fchren, the Damendorf man, and the famous Osterby skull with the Suebian knot hairstyle. There are also smaller finds like hair and textile fragments.\n\nWhile Schloss Gottorf is being renovated they\u2019re letting people see them in Silkeborg alongside the Danish bog bodies. It\u2019s probably the largest bog body assemblage ever displayed together in one place.\n\nMore info:\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ocqdar/for_fellow_european_archaeologists_the_worlds/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How useful would TTS with non-mainstream voices be for teaching, gaming, or content creation?", "summary": "It seems that most high-quality text-to-speech tools are overwhelmingly trained on \"standard\" prestige accents (like General American or RP). They're mainstream voices, vanilla, and honestly a bit boring--lacking character or flair. \n\nThis creates a gap. We have tools that can pronounce words clearly, but they don't capture the vast phonetic and prosodic diversity of how English is actually spoken.\n\nI'm thinking about building a synthesis tool capable of generating specific regional and social accents. Not just that, but voices with quirks, unique timbres, slurs, moods, slang, and even speech impediments (eg., lisps, stutters). I'm hoping to capture the richness of regional speech from rural Texas to Lagos, Sydney, Glasgow, or Kyoto. \n\nThe primary applications I'm exploring are:\n\n1. **CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning):** Giving ELL/ESL students exposure to a variety of accents to improve real-world listening comprehension.\n2. **Media/Accessibility:** Providing more authentic and representative voices for storytelling, game development, or content creation.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Do you see a real-world use for it? Would you personally use this or is it just a gimmick?\n* From an application side, do you see other key uses for this kind of tech in the NLP/lang-tech pipeline that I might be missing?\n* From a technical standpoint, what do you see as the main bottleneck?

Or are there significant modeling challenges in disentangling accent from speaker identity and prosody?\n* Are you aware of existing research, models, or datasets (perhaps low-resource) that are making good progress on this specific problem?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ocvjuq/how_useful_would_tts_with_nonmainstream_voices_be/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Don\u2019t use AI to tell you how to vote in election, says Dutch watchdog", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/21/ai-chatbots-unreliable-biased-advice-voters-dutch-watchdog", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Al Jazeera documentary reveals new evidence in Hind Rajab family\u2019s killing", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/new-al-jazeera-documentary-reveals-evidence-in-hind-rajab-familys-killing", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indigenous artifacts held in Vatican Museums finally head back to Canada", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/vatican-museums-indigenous-artifacts-canada-9.6946597", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan\u2019s next target could be India\u2019s economy", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/opinion/pakistan-next-target-could-be-india-economy/2767343/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Well Known Ruin Near 4 Corners USA - We Still Saw Corn Cobs and Shards", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocwldf", "author": "None"}, {"title": "SpecSeek - x86 CPUID Parser I wrote", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Mellurboo/SpecSeek", "author": "None"}, {"title": "German media bias falsely inflates crime by foreigners", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/german-media-bias-falsely-inflates-crime-by-foreigners/a-74410565", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Easily benchmark which STTs are best suited for YOUR use case.", "summary": "You see STT benchmarks everywhere, but they don\u2019t really mean anything.  \n**Everyone has their own use case**, type of callers, type of words used, etc.  \nSo instead of testing blindly, we **open sourced our code to let you benchmark** easily with your own audio files.\n\n1. git clone [\n2. remove all the audios from the Audio folder and add yours\n3. edit dataset.json with the labeling for each of your audios (expected results)\n4. in launch\\_test, edit stt\\_to\\_tests to include all the STTs you want to test, we already included the main ones but you can add more thanks to Livekit plugins\n5. run the test python launch\\_test.py\n6. get the results via python wer.py &gt; wer\\_results.txt\n\nThat\u2019s it!  \nWe did the same internally for LLM benchmarking through Livekit, would you be interested if I release it too?  \nAnd do you see any possible improvements in our methodology?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1oc81ov/easily_benchmark_which_stts_are_best_suited_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "1897 Ghost of Zona Heaster Shue's Testimony somehow, the court believed it.", "summary": "In 1897 a young woman named **Zona Heaster Shue** was found dead in her West Virginia home.
