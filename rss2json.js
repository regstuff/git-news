I like to provide data based original analysis and look for a relevant angle not covered in the mainstream media, or where I feel their coverage is inadequate.  \nI don't write on something where I have nothing new to say, no real interest, or someone else can do a better job. I hope it will help readers to have a fact based discussion and enable a fresh look at these topics.
