But I\u2019d like to propose something unconventional: What if we gave Indy another look, as a source of unexpectedly authentic historical and archaeological inspiration?\n\n# The Authenticity of Raiders\u2019 Archaeology\n\nWhile working for Lucasfilm at Skywalker Ranch, I handled many of the props from the original Indiana Jones trilogy. I was struck by perfectly rendered hieroglyphics, inscriptions in correct Middle Semitic characters, mummy cases so meticulously crafted that they could have come from the British Museum. These were not just Hollywood flights of fancy; they reflected meticulous historical research, and the closer I looked, the more I found. That discovery sparked a journey for me, one that grew into a globe-trotting quest to explore how much of the world of *Raiders* was grounded in authentic archaeology and history.\n\n# A Globe-Trotting Quest for the Truth\n\nThis was not an attempt to hold an action movie to nonfiction documentary standards. Instead, I asked: How much reality can we find in this film that was meant merely to entertain? To my surprise, I discovered that *Raiders* treats history and culture with a remarkable degree of respect. Unlike its more fanciful sequels, Indy\u2019s debut film sets its over-the-top action within a context greatly enriched by inspiration from real history and archaeology.\n\nI\u2019m an archaeologist, so I went to see the evidence for myself!\n\n* I tracked down *Raiders* filming locations in the deserts of Tunisia and the jungles of Hawaii.\n* I also ventured to the real-life archaeological sites they represented.\n* I followed the trail of Indiana Jones wherever it led me, from Peru to Cairo and from California to the Smithsonian, uncovering connections with historical reality.\n* Along the way, I met with the filmmakers, including Indy\u2019s creator George Lucas and Production Designer Norman Reynolds, and pieced together a fresh perspective on the work that went into creating the world of Indiana Jones.\n\n[I kept an illustrated journal inspired by the Last Crusade Grail Diary, which I studied in the Lucasfilm Archives](\n\n# Introducing Chasing Raiders: The Archaeology of Indiana Jones\n\nThis journey has culminated in a documentary project, *Chasing Raiders: The Archaeology of Indiana Jones*. It\u2019s not about defending Indiana Jones as a character (or glorifying the sequels); instead, it\u2019s about asking: What gateways does this movie offer into the study of real history? What valuable inspiration can we find, amidst the film\u2019s superlative action entertainment? For me, *Raiders* captured better than any other film a combination of the spirit of adventure, the fascination of archaeology, and the thrill of discovering new insights into the ancient world. All of these have been a great positive influence on my career and my life.\n\n[The project became a quest for the \\\\\"Indiana Jones experience\\\\\"](\n\n# The project is live on Kickstarter now, with a pitch video that lays it all out. If you\u2019re curious, please check it out, and I\u2019d be glad to hear your thoughts. As archaeologists, we are always uncovering new layers of understanding. Why not take another look at Raiders with me? Perhaps we\u2019ll find a new way of seeing the cultural icon that is Indiana Jones.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 [Watch the Pitch Video on Kickstarter](\n\n**Raiders Deserves a Reappraisal**\n\nThank you for letting me share this with you. I respect the community\u2019s concerns about how archaeology is portrayed in cinema, and you won\u2019t hear me suggesting Indiana Jones as a model for real-world practice. But I do believe *Raiders* deserves a closer examination\u2014and a thoughtful reappraisal.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1h7i0q4/reconsidering_indiana_jones_a_new_take_on_raiders/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "An Archaeological Reckoning", "summary": "", "link": "https://nautil.us/an-archaeological-reckoning-1167536/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Georgian PM vows to 'eradicate liberal fascism' amid crackdown on pro-EU protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241205-georgian-pm-vows-to-eradicate-opposition-amid-pro-eu-protests", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A third of Earth's species could become extinct by 2100 if climate change isn't curbed", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/a-third-of-earths-species-could-become-extinct-by-2100-if-climate-change-isnt-curbed", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - Elata-Biosciences/elata-vsm-system-4: AI-powered intelligence platform aggregating breakthroughs in neuroscience, computational psychiatry, and mental health research.
