Initially, KeyTik focused on being a keyboard remapper with profiles, allowing you to activate or deactivate each remap individually. However, since KeyTik uses AutoHotkey as its scripting language, it can handle all types of automation available in AutoHotkey, such as auto-clicking, keyboard remapping, screen clicking, opening multiple files, and more. Additionally, the use of AutoHotkey has made KeyTik an AutoHotkey script manager. This means you can easily run, exit, run on startup, edit, store, delete, and do more with your AutoHotkey scripts.\n\nWith a bit of scripting, you can do almost all automation tasks with ease. If you don't have coding experience, don't worry! We've created a beginner-friendly open-source\u00a0[AutoHotkey script collection and template](\u00a0that allows you to download pre-made scripts or edit them to your preferences. We've tried to make it as easy to understand as possible, with guides on how to use the templates or customize the scripts.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a lightweight auto-clicker, keyboard remapper, screen clicker, multiple files opener, and AutoHotkey script manager with a user-friendly GUI in a single software, then this is exactly what you need! I hope you enjoy using KeyTik and find it useful.\n\nDon't forget to stars if you like it!", "link": "https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China's Xi meets India's Modi in Tianjin", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-meets-indias-modi-tianjin-2025-08-31/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In Indonesia, protesters set fire to regional parliament building, leaving 3 dead", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-08-30/3-dead-after-mob-sets-fire-to-indonesian-regional-parliament-building", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Protesters throw stones at Argentina\u2019s Milei over corruption allegations linked to sister", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/28/argentina-javier-milei-hit-with-rocks-on-campaign-trail-amid-corruption-scandal-ntwnfb", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Israel] At rallies, families urge leaders to take hostage deal on table, abort Gaza City takeover", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-rallies-families-urge-leaders-to-take-hostage-deal-on-table-abort-gaza-city-takeover/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Air India crash: Families prepared for court fight over disaster which left 260 dead | World News", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/air-india-crash-families-prepared-for-court-fight-over-disaster-which-left-241-dead-13418767", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Modi, Ishiba visit Tokyo Electron facility to deepen semiconductor ties - Nikkei Asia", "summary": "", "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/modi-ishiba-visit-tokyo-electron-facility-to-deepen-semiconductor-ties", "author": "None"}, {"title": "No permanent friends or foes in international ties: Rajnath Singh", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-permanent-friends-or-foes-in-international-ties-rajnath-singh/articleshow/123608540.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scottish brothers complete record 139-day row across Pacific", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/31/australia/scottish-brothers-pacific-ocean-australia-record-row", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Does anyone know what does this stone carving represent", "summary": "I found this in  mukha Mantapa of an old Shiva temple at Mahatobara Mahalingeshwara temple in Basrur, Kundapura.It looks like carving of 2 faced crane eating elephant.\n", "link": "https://i.redd.it/ocpgoxvczcmf1.jpeg", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
