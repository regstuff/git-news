The situation escalated when IKF\u2019s President, Vinod Tiwari, questioned the event's legitimacy, leading Cambodian authorities to withdraw support due to legal concerns. This incident highlights how internal political bickering between sports bodies undermines India's soft power efforts and credibility.\n\n***Dramatis Personae***\n\n1. **Vinod Tiwari**: President of the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF) and Deputy Director of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), who sent a letter to Cambodian authorities raising concerns about the World Cup Kabaddi event in Phnom Penh. \\[[src](\n2. **S.T.

The Ministry of Interior\u2019s Sports Council, along with representatives from World Kabaddi, officially launched the event, promising a significant boost for sports tourism and the promotion of kabaddi globally. \\[[Khmer Times](\n2. **The Undercurrent of Concerns (June 6, 2024)**: Vinod Tiwari, in his capacity as IKF President and OCA Deputy Director, sent a letter to the NOCC expressing concerns about the World Cup Kabaddi event, stating that it was not recognized by IKF and indicating potential actions against it. This letter, which came to light later, influenced the NOCC\u2019s decision to reconsider their support for the event. \\[[Kiripost](\n3. **Cambodia\u2019s Withdrawal of Support (July 22-25, 2024)**: Following the receipt of Tiwari\u2019s letter, Vath Chamroeun and the MoEYS formally announced that they could not support the World Cup Kabaddi in Cambodia due to the absence of a recognized national federation for the sport, making the event non-compliant with Cambodian law. This decision was conveyed through an official letter and publicly shared via social media. \\[[NOCC]( \\[[Khmer Times]( \\[[EAC News](\n4. **The Fallout and Event Relocation (July 31-August 1, 2024)**: S.T. Arasu announced the relocation of the World Cup from Cambodia to India on World Cup Kabaddi website, expressing deep disappointment over the way the situation was handled. Arasu primarily alleged that Vinod Tiwari, President of IKF and Deputy Director of Olympic Committee of Asia (OCA), used his other position to unduly influence the NOCC against hosting the event in Cambodia. Arasu also criticized Cambodian authorities for not engaging in any discussions with World Kabaddi before withdrawing their support for the event. He emphasized that they had not received any formal communication from the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia (NOCC) or the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MoEYS), learning of the decision only through a leak on social media. Despite raising concerns with IKF, Arasu claimed that they did not receive any response, further complicating World Kabaddi\u2019s efforts to address the situation and forcing the eventual relocation of the event to India. \\[[World Cup Kabaddi](\n\n***Analysis of Events***\u00a0-\u00a0**India's Diplomatic Own Goal**\n\nThe sudden relocation of WC Kabaddi from Cambodia to India is not just a minor shuffle in the sports calendar - it is a telling example of how internal political bickering can undermine India's public and private efforts to expand influence in unexpected ways. This entire masala geopolitics situation calls into question the credibility of India's sports administration and the risks India faces when these power struggles spill over onto the global stage.\n\n1. **Power Plays and Personal Influence**: Vinod Tiwari, who wears two hats as the President of the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF) and Deputy Director of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), found himself at the center of this controversy. When he sent a letter to the Cambodian National Olympic Committee (NOCC), questioning the legitimacy of the event, it seemed like more than just a routine concern. Many might see it as a power play, where Tiwari was flexing his muscle to influence the outcome. What makes this even murkier is the fact that IKF didn\u2019t respond to the concerns raised by World Kabaddi\u2019s Secretary General, S.T. Arasu. This silence only adds to the impression that Tiwari\u2019s actions were more about consolidating power than about promoting the sport.\n2. **Cambodia\u2019s Missed Opportunity**: Arguably, Cambodia had a lot riding on this event. The initial excitement around hosting the World Cup Kabaddi was palpable, especially with officials from World Kabaddi meeting with Cambodian authorities to discuss the event. The participation of 20 teams, including\u00a0[China making its first international appearance in decades]( made it clear that this was going to be a big deal. But then came the bombshell\u2014Cambodian authorities, citing legal technicalities, pulled the plug on their support. Suddenly, Cambodia found itself not just out of the game but out of the spotlight, losing both the financial benefits (USD 500,000 and over, based on Arasu's estimates) and the diplomatic goodwill that could have come with hosting such a significant event.\n3. **The China Connection**: China\u2019s involvement in the World Cup Kabaddi was a major coup. Their participation after such a long absence was a signal of the sport\u2019s growing international appeal. It was also a chance for India and China to engage in a positive, non-political way. But with the event\u2019s abrupt relocation, that opportunity may have been squandered. Instead of building bridges through sports, India\u2019s internal sports politics might have thrown up new barriers, potentially souring future cooperation with China in this area.\n4. **India\u2019s Diplomatic Misstep**: From a diplomatic standpoint, the entire situation is a bit of an own goal. India had a golden opportunity to showcase its soft power by supporting the global spread of kabaddi and strengthening ties with Cambodia and other participating nations. A pre-World cup event in Phnom Penh was set to be a diplomatic achievement, with the\u00a0[Indian Ambassador Devyani Khobragade and her Malaysian counterpart actively promoting the event](\u00a0and attending the official draw ceremony alongside representatives from other countries. These efforts were ultimately squandered.\n\n**A Strategic Blunder:**\u00a0**~~!ncredible~~**\u00a0**Noncredible India**\n\nThe whole debacle highlights a series of strategic missteps that could have been avoided with better communication and planning. From the information available publicly, it seems that if the IKF had engaged more constructively with World Kabaddi and Cambodian authorities, with more dialogue and less top-down pressure, the outcome might have been different. This was a golden opportunity for India to lead by example, to promote a traditional sport on the world stage, and to forge stronger international partnerships. Instead, it became story of intrigue, bickering and internal rivalries spilling over into the global arena, leaving a sour taste in everyone's mouth.\n\nAdding to the disappointment was the Cambodian team, which had put in months of intensive training under an Indian coach, with hopes of making a strong debut on the international stage. Their hard work and dedication were\u00a0[ultimately overshadowed by the controversy]( leaving them and their supporters disheartened. These events make for an important case study in the broader challenges faced by sports in India, where internal conflicts can sometimes undermine the nation\u2019s potential to lead on the global stage.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1f70i2z/masala_geopolitics_indias_kabaddi_conundrum_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Implementing \"mixture of LoRA experts\"", "summary": "Recently I'm using unsloth's LoRA to finetune llama with multiple datasets including Math, Coding, Reasoning.
