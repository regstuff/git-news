And how would be the best approach to make them not only efficient but also to work within the same values of openness, collaboration and sustainability that we share, and we do not see in current available models.\n\n\n\nInspiring initiatives in other fields make us think that there is another way around Big Tech corporations, and we would like to understand the developer perspective on it.\n\n\n\nWe are happy to hear any opinions, discussions, strategic advices, development tips or any other remark shared that you think is essential for developing, deploying and maintaining such an open source AI system for Landscape Architecture.\n\n\n\nFor context, as Landscape Architects, our work is quite broad, from designing green public spaces for cities, to developing city level planning focused on greener, walkable and climate adaptive neighborhoods, to larger regional plans focused on nature and floodplain restoration.\n\n\n\nIn the field of landscape architecture the emergence of the computer and internet changed the profession, and not always for good. We can see the risks of ai, pushing landscape architects to more generic design, quick visual output, efficiency, low cost, etcetera. At the same time we see the opportunity of integrating ever improving climate models, ecology mapping, better understanding how to manipulate the landscape to optimize biodiversity and climate adaptivity. But what about the things that are hard to digitalise? Word to mouth stories, soft values, local culture, local history, seasonality, atmosphere, etcetera? Exactly because landscape architecture is not a very large/profitable market, it\u2019s not likely commercial companies will jump on this. We think it\u2019s worth developing/training an AI for local soft values - run on a solar/hydro powered datacenter. With universities - but we\u2019d need a larger community to make it work.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for any answer \u2013 we will link to this post and fully cite you in the magazine for all the information shared,\n\n\n\nAnd hopefully we can build a collective view on this,\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nSimon", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1f3xeex/how_to_build_open_source_ai_models_for_landscape/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Word embeddings in multiple hidden layer infrastructure", "summary": "Trying to wrap my head around the word2vec concept which, as far as I understand it has only 1 hidden layer and the weights of that hidden layer effectively represent the embeddings for a given word. So it is essentially a linear optimization problem.\n\nWhat if we would extend word2vec however, by adding an additional hidden layer. Which layer weights would subsequently represent embeddings, the last one or some combination of the two layers?\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1f3wpw7/word_embeddings_in_multiple_hidden_layer/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Liberal MP sponsors petition to open a new Air India bombing investigation", "summary": "", "link": "https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-liberal-mp-sponsors-petition-to-re-open-air-india-bombing/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany's far right predicted to make biggest gains since Nazi era in key state elections", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-29/germanys-far-right-predicted-to-make-biggest-gains-since-nazi-era-in-key-state-elections", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Young Boy Accidentally Shatters 3,500-Year-Old Jar at Museum", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scihb.com/2024/08/young-boy-accidentally-shatters-3500.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ana Victoria Espino from Zacatecas is World's First Lawyer with Down Syndrome", "summary": "", "link": "https://hiplatina.com/ana-victoria-first-lawyer-down-syndrome/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can AI Agents Execute Complete Translation Workflows?", "summary": "", "link": "https://slator.com/can-ai-agents-execute-complete-translation-workflows/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scientists pose as cleaner fish to perform whale shark ultrasounds", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2024/08/scientists-pose-as-cleaner-fish-to-perform-whale-shark-ultrasounds/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ancient people in Taiwan yanked healthy teeth from their mouths for 'aesthetic expression' and 'tests of courage,' study finds", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.shiningscience.com/2024/08/ancient-people-in-taiwan-yanked-healthy.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin Has Spent More Than \u00a31bn This Week Alone Attacking Ukraine", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/putin-has-spent-more-than-ps1bn-this-week-alone-attacking-ukraine_uk_66d04d0be4b08063c0bf78ba", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rare seal discovered in Jerusalem", "summary": "\"2,700-year-old stone seal is inscribed with the words 'Yeho\u02bcezer son of Hosh\u02bcayahu'; its image of a protective winged demon or genie betrays Assyrian influence\"\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1f3y694/rare_seal_discovered_in_jerusalem/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'Richly decorated weapon' from Edo Japan unearthed in World War II rubble in Germany", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/17th-century-japanese-sword-featuring-god-of-good-luck-unearthed-in-germany", "author": "None"}, {"title": "IDF says documents found in Gaza show Hamas was falsifying prominent polling results", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-documents-found-in-gaza-show-hamas-was-falsifying-prominent-polling-results/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cat Therapy Celebrates 7 Years with Kitten Party.
