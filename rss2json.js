Can we get a specific scope/ruleset defined for this sub to help differentiate us from all of the LLM-focused &amp; Linguistics subreddits?", "summary": "Hey folks!\n\nI've been active in this sub for the past few years, and I feel that the recent buzz with LLMs has really thrown a wrench in the scoping of this sub. Historically, this was a great sub for getting a good mixture of practical NLP Python advise and integrating it with concepts in linguistics. Right now, it feels like this sub is a bit undecided in the scope and more focused on removing LLM-article spam than anything else. Legitimate activity seems to have declined significantly.\n\nTo help articulate my point, I listed a bunch of NLP-oriented subreddits and their respective scopes:\n\n* r/LocalLLaMA - This subreddit is the forefront of open source LLM technology, and it centers around Meta's LLaMA framework. This community covers the most technical aspects to LLMs and includes model development &amp; hardware in its scope.\n* r/RAG - This is a sub dedicated purely to practical use of LLM technology through Retrieval Augmented Generation. It likely has 0% involvement with training new LLM models, which is incredibly expensive. There is much less hardware addressed here - instead, there is a focus on cloud deployment via AWS/Azure/GCP.\n* r/compling - Where LanguageTechnology focused more on practical applications of NLP, the compling sub tended to skew more academic (academic professional advice, schools, and papers). Application questions seem to be much more grounded in linguistics rather than solving a practical problem.\n* r/MachineLearning - This sub is a much more broad application of ML, which includes NLP, Computer Vision, and general data science.\n* r/NLP - We dislike this sub because they were the first to take the subreddit name of a legitimate technology and use it for a psuedoscience (Neuro linguistic processing) - included just for completeness.\n\nIn my head, this subreddit has always complemented r/compling - where that sub is academic-oriented, this sub has historically focused on practical applications &amp; using Python to implement specific algorithms/methodologies. LLM and transformer based models certainly have a home here, but I've found that the posts regarding training an LLM from scratch or architecting a RAG pipeline on AWS seem to be a bit outside the scope of what was traditionally explored here.\n\nI don't mean to call out the mod here, but they're stretched too thin.
