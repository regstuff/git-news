I'm just posting my plans on here for any comments, advice, or anecdotes regarding my plans. Thanks in advance!\n\nAfter graduation, my plan is to apply to at least two field schools in the US (hopefully focused on the West Coast where I want to specialize) and to get GIS certification. After that, applying for field tech work in California in CRM. I love being outside, have worked on a ranch, conservation research volunteer, so I am aware of the physical requirements. My biggest concern is that I am in my mid 30s, and my bf and I are talking about having kids soon. It's a long shot, but I'm hoping there are some women in the subreddit with advice on how to balance having a family and also CRM work because I am well aware of how insane the scheduling can be. My hopes are to at least get out onto the field for 3-5 years, and then once I start having kids to pop back over to academia to finish my MA. I really enjoy both sides: being out in the field and research. I know it's a lot to want to do both and with having kids I probably wont have time to achieve both. But I can dream.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1mck7t6/post_undergrad_plans_advice_welcomed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Blindspot Finder Prompt: What You\u2019re Not Using AI For (But Should Be)", "summary": "Most prompts tell you what AI *can* do.  \nThis one tells you what **you\u2019re not doing, but should be**.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n(Diagnostic Prompt for ChatGPT o3-Pro w/DR)  \nThis Deep Research powered prompt uncovers 10+1 high-leverage, personalized AI use cases you\u2019re probably overlooking. Each one is a mini-playbook tailored to your real goals, habits, and systems. Output quality depends heavily on how much context you\u2019ve already given ChatGPT (memory, chat history, files).\n\n**Overview**  \nI originally wrote this prompt for myself to help build a deeply personalized AI leverage map. Basically a tool to help guide me on what I should learn and implement next as part of my evolution and growth with AI.\n\nI built this for ChatGPT o3-Pro with Deep Research enabled. It uses your GPT memory, full chat history, and optionally your Google Drive to uncover 10+1 high-leverage use cases you\u2019re likely overlooking.\n\nEach recommendation is treated like a Mini Playbook:\n\n* Specific use cases (across roles/domains)\n* Tools, models, and integrations\n* Cross-domain leverage\n* Concrete \u201cFirst 3 Steps\u201d to get started\n* Repeatability + systemization advice\n* Effort vs. Impact scoring\n* A disruptor idea to shake up your assumptions\n\nI attempted to combine strong structural logic with built-in constraints to keep outputs grounded and help make it at least somewhat hallucination-resistant. I also built in an originality filter: each idea must rate at least 8/10 for relevance, novelty, and feasibility.\n\n**How To Get The Most Out Of It**  \nThis shines brightest for experienced ChatGPT users. If you\u2019ve:\n\n* Used memory extensively\n* Logged diverse personal and professional chats\n* Connected Drive files with your personal background, goals, workflows, past projects, +\n\n\u2026then this prompt can generate eerily personalized insights.\n\nA word of caution: if you\u2019re early in your usage, it may feel generic or underwhelming.\n\nIf you meet the bar, then hopefully you'll be as amazed as I was at its insights!\n\n**Usage Note**  \nWhen o3-Pro w/DR asks you it's typical 5 follow-up questions before it kicks off it's research, it is going to ask you to provide answers to a bunch of the things the prompt tells it to look for. Since we want the output grounded in your user memory, chat, and connected drive files you can help reinforce this by answer those questions like this:\n\n1. Please glean the answers to these questions from the three knowledge stores outlined in the original prompt: GPT User Memory, Full Chat History, and documents found via the Google drive connector.\n2. See answer to #1.\n3. See answer to #1.\n4. See answer to #1.\n5. See answer to #1.\n\n**Personal Usage**  \nI used this for myself and uncovered several blind spots where I\u2019d been under-leveraging workflows I thought were optimized but weren't, among many other useful ideas, all tailored to me personally: my projects, goals, +.\n\nI've been using the ChatGPT for a few years now across professional and personal projects with memory turned on. I also supplied it with a number of files in both PDF and MD formats via the connected drive that included my professional history, my current projects, my personal and professional goals, plus a bunch of additional data about me to help provide context.\n\nAfter \"thinking\" for 28 minutes, reviewing 26 sources, and conducting 3 searches it's output was a well structured, 50 page roadmap of how I can leverage AI in deeply personal ways to really level up my endeavors across domains.\n\nIt\u2019s now my blueprint for what to learn and build next across my professional and personal goals.\n\nHonestly? Last night was the first time in months I didn\u2019t go to bed asking, \u201cWhat should I explore next with AI?\u201d  Now I've got a list of high ROI ideas, tailor made for me, that outline exactly what to learn, how to get started building, etc. Good stuff!\n\nI'm sharing here in case others want to test, tweak, or use it to level up their own AI usage.\n\nWould love feedback on whether anything could push it further, especially for improving clarity, hallucination resistance, or actionability. \n\nAlso just generally curious what others think of it's output for them. \n\nWhat surprising blindspot did it surface for you?\n\n**Here\u2019s the full prompt:**\n\n    # Target-Model: ChatGPT o3-Pro (with Deep Research enabled)\n    You are a high-performance AI strategist with Deep Research enabled. You have advanced pattern recognition, long-range reasoning, and full context access to the user\u2019s behavioral and strategic history.\n    You have on-demand retrieval access to three persistent user knowledge stores:\n    1. **GPT User Memory** (long-term profile notes)\n    2. **Full Chat History** (all prior conversations with the user)\n    3. **Google Drive Connector**, if enabled (documents, data, and content in any format)\n    Use these resources to ground your insights. Cross-check all reasoning against what is retrievable from these stores. Avoid speculation. If uncertain, clearly flag ambiguity.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## Your Task:\n    Generate **10 deeply personalized, high-leverage ways** the user should be using AI\u2014**but hasn\u2019t yet considered**.\n    Your recommendations must:\n    - Reflect the user\u2019s actual habits, systems, values, and pain points\n    - Be *non-obvious*\u2014either creatively new or surprisingly underused\n    - Prioritize *leverage*: ideas that yield exponential returns on time, clarity, insight, or creativity\n    - Span both personal and professional life\n    - Pass a usefulness filter: each idea must score **8/10 or higher** in relevance, novelty, and feasibility\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## Step 1 \u2013 Strategic Abstraction (\"Step-Back\" Mode)\n    Begin with a short synthesis of:\n    - The user\u2019s dominant motivations and strategic drivers\n    - Recurring pain points, inefficiencies, or sticking points\n    - Underutilized assets (e.g., workflows, tool mastery, behaviors)\n    - Cognitive, creative, or organizational patterns you observe\n    - Repeated preferences or constraints that shape how they work or live\n    This section should reveal actionable meta-patterns that explain why the next ideas matter.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## Step 2 \u2013 High-Leverage AI Use Cases (Checklist Format)\n    For each of the 10 ideas, use this structure:\n    - **Name:** A bold, descriptive label  \n    - **Summary:** A 1\u20132 sentence explanation  \n    - **Why This Is High-Leverage:** Tie back to Step 1 patterns and explain its personal fit  \n    - **Real-Life Applications:** Practical scenarios across different roles or contexts  \n    - **Tools / Methods:** Specific models, APIs, frameworks, or integrations  \n    - **Anchor Evidence (if applicable):** Cite behavior, quotes, docs, or themes from memory or chat history  \n    - **Benefits:** Concrete outcomes\u2014productivity, creativity, insight, confidence, alignment  \n    - **First 3 Steps:** What to do within 7 days to test it  \n    - **Repeatability &amp; Systemization:** How this could evolve into a reusable or automated process  \n    - **Cross-Domain Leverage:** How this idea bridges multiple life domains  \n    - **Priority Level:** Quick Win / Mid-Term Play / Strategic Bet  \n    - **Effort vs. Impact Score:** (Effort: Low/Med/High, Impact: Low/Med/High)  \n    - **Custom Advice:** Tactics, mindset shifts, or specific constraints to consider  \n    - **Optional Extensions:** Adjacent or nested ideas that could evolve from this\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## Step 3 \u2013 Contrarian Disruptor (Bonus #11)\n    Include one idea that intentionally challenges the user\u2019s current assumptions, workflows, or comfort zones. Frame it as an *optional, high-upside disruption*. Make it provocative but well-reasoned.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## Final Instructions:\n    - Use your Deep Research capabilities to be insight-rich, not verbose.  \n    - Eliminate anything generic. Assume the user is already prompt-literate and wants serious breakthroughs.  \n    - Use only real tools or clearly mark examples.  \n    - Conclude with a brief meta-reflection: What do these 10+1 ideas suggest about the user\u2019s next frontier with AI?\n    **Tone:** Strategic, curious, slightly conversational  \n    **Depth:** Each idea should feel like a mini playbook, not a bullet point. Prioritize insight over breadth.  \n    **Critical Thinking:** Make sure ideas are truly novel or overlooked by the user\u2014not generic advice.  \n    **Self-Audit:** Before finalizing, evaluate each idea for originality, relevance, and execution clarity. Improve or replace weak ones. Present output as a single, well-structured checklist.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## Output Formatting Guidelines\n    - Format output with **clear section headers**, bolded titles, consistent bullet formatting, and adequate paragraph spacing.\n    - Each of the 10+1 ideas should begin with a **visually distinct heading**, such as:\n      ## Idea 1: [Descriptive Title]\n    \n    - Within each idea, use **labeled sub-sections** formatted as:\n      **Summary:**  \n      A brief overview...\n      **Why This Is High-Leverage:**  \n      Explanation...\n      **Real-Life Applications:**  \n      - Example 1  \n      - Example 2\n    \n    - Use bullet points (-) or sub-bullets (  -) where appropriate to organize lists or nested concepts.\n    - Ensure each idea block is separated by **a full blank line** to improve scanability.\n    - Avoid dense or continuous walls of text\u2014**structure is part of the delivery quality.**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mctawn/a_blindspot_finder_prompt_what_youre_not_using_ai/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is anyone else having inconsistent experience with MCPO?", "summary": "I have a few tools attached to gemini 2.5 flash (open router) through MCPO.
