Use these two years to become a competitive application for top programs(think T5 or T10) and\n2. Prepare for the actual day to day work I will be doing as a PhD student.   \n  \nFor further reference, my bachelors is from a developing country, and the master's I'm about to start is in France.

I'm trying to use brat, however there are some compound nouns, which can't be annotated, because they're overlapping. For example I got \"Netzwerk- und Kommunikationstechnik\".\n\nI want to tag \"Netzwerktechnik\" and \"Kommunikationstechnik\". While I can tag \"Netzwerktechnik\" by adding \"technik\" as a fragment I can't tag \"Kommunikationstechnik\" due to the overlap.\n\nIs there any way to properly tag this or do I have to live with just annotating \"Netzwerk-\" and \"Kommunikationstechnik\"?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cqv6z4/overlapping_annotations_in_brat/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Artifacts from the First Temple in the city of David accurately dated for a more precise timeline", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-05-artifacts-temple-city-david-accurately.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russians simply walked in, Ukraine troops in Kharkiv tell BBC", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72p0xx410xo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[CfP] EMNLP 2024 Industry Track (Miami, Florida, USA)", "summary": "", "link": "https://2024.emnlp.org/calls/industry_track/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Experimental cancer treatment gives New Jersey mom a chance for a second baby: \u2018I decided to go for it\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/experimental-cancer-treatment-gives-new-jersey-mom-chance-second-baby-go-for-it", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UN General Assembly presses Security Council to give \u2018favourable consideration\u2019 to full Palestinian membership", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/05/1149596", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India must avoid confrontation with Five Eyes.
