The goal is simple: the staff should just talk, and the order should appear.\n\nIn a Vietnamese kitchen, that sounds like this:\n\n&gt;\n\nThis isn't a clean, scripted user experience. It's *shouting* across a noisy room. When designing this, I fully expected the technical nightmare to be the Natural Language Processing (NLP), extracting the prices, quantities, and all the \"less fat, no ice\" modifiers.\n\nI was dead wrong.\n\nThe hardest, most frustrating technical hurdle was the very first step: **getting the system to accurately wake up.**\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of the app in action:\n\n\n\n# The Fundamental Problem Wasn\u2019t the Tech, It Was the Accent\n\nWe started by testing reputable wake word providers, including **Picovoice**. They are industry leaders for a reason: stable SDKs, excellent documentation, and predictable performance.\n\nBut stability and predictability broke down in a real Vietnamese environment:\n\n* **Soft speech:** The wake phrase was missed entirely.\n* **Kitchen Noise:** False triggers, or the system activated too late.\n* **Regional Accents:** Accuracy plummeted when a speaker used a different dialect (Hanoi vs. Hue vs. Saigon).\n\nThe reality is, **Vietnamese pronunciation is not acoustically standardized.** Even a simple, two-syllable phrase like \"Vema \u01a1i\" has countless variations. An engine trained primarily on global, generalized English data will inherently struggle with the specific, messy nuances of a kitchen in Binh Thanh District.\n\nIt wasn't that the engine was bad; it's that it wasn't built for *this* specific acoustic environment. We tried to force it, and we paid for that mismatch in time and frustration.\n\n# Why DaVoice Became Our Practical Choice\n\nMy team started looking for hyper-specialized solutions. We connected with **DaVoice**, a team focused on solving wake word challenges in non-English, high variation languages.\n\nTheir pitch wasn't about platform scale; it was about precision:\n\n&gt;\n\nThat approach resonated deeply. We shifted our focus from platform integration to data collection:\n\n* **14 different Vietnamese speakers.**\n* **3\u20134 variations** from each (different tone, speed, noise).\n* Sent the dataset, and they delivered a custom model **in under 48 hours.**\n\nWe put it straight into a real restaurant during peak rush hour (plates, hissing, shouting, fans). The result?\n\n* **97% real-world wake word accuracy.**\n\n  \n*For those curious about their wake word technology, here\u2019s their site:*\n\n[**\n\nThis wasn't theoretical lab accuracy. This was the level of reliability needed to make a voice-activated POS actually viable.\n\n# Practical Comparison: No \"Winner,\" Just the Right Fit\n\nIn the real world of building products, you choose the tool that fits the constraint.\n\n|**Approach**|**The Pro**|**The Real World Constraint**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Build In-House**|Total technical control.|Requires huge datasets of local, diverse voices (too slow, too costly).|\n|**Use Big Vendors**|Stable, scalable, documented (Excellent tools like Picovoice).|Optimized for generalized, global languages; local accents become expensive edge cases.|\n|**Use DaVoice**|Trained exactly on our user voices; fast iteration and response.|We are reliant on a small, niche vendor for ongoing support.|\n\nThat dependency turned out to be a major advantage. They treated our unique accent challenge as a core problem to solve, not a ticket in a queue. **Most vendors give you a model; DaVoice gave us a responsive partnership.**\n\nWhen you build voice tech for real-world applications, the \"best\" tool isn't the biggest, it's the one that adapts fastest to how people *really* talk.\n\n# Final Thought: Wake Words are Foundation, Not Feature\n\nA voice product dies at the wake word. It doesn't fail during the complex NLP phase.\n\nIf the system doesn't activate precisely when the user says the command, the entire pipeline is useless:\n\n* Not the intent parser\n* Not the entity extraction\n* Not the UX\n* Not the demo video\n\nAll of it collapses.\n\nFor our restaurant POS, that foundation had to be robust, noise-resistant, and hyperlocal. In this case, that foundation was built with DaVoice. Not because of marketing hype, but because that bowl of *ph\u1edf* needs to get into the cart the second someone shouts the order\n\n# If You\u2019re Building Voice Tech, Let's Connect.\n\nI'm keen to share insights on:\n\n* Accent modeling and dataset creation.\n* NLP challenges in informal/slang-heavy speech.\n* Solving high noise environmental constraints.\n\nIf we keep building voice tech outside the English-first bubble, the next wave of AI might actually start listening to how *we* talk, not just how we're told to.

He insists that he supports continued membership of the bloc.\n\nIn a lecture at\u00a0Charles University in Prague, Nawrocki said the Poles and the Czechs know well from their history the dangers of being treated as \u201cstudents of European integration\u201d by \u201cmore experienced\u201d Western countries, rather than as partners or leaders in such change.\n\nToday, once again, \u201ccertain Western partners try to guide us in the one and only right direction\u201d, warned the Polish president.\n\nHe argued that the EU which Poland joined 21 years ago \u2013 one that would provide economic opportunities and freedom of movement \u2013 has turned into one that is trying to \u201cdictate the terms of our political system, our diet, or the upbringing of our children\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there are \u201ccertain forces at play that aim at creating a more centralised European Union\u2026\\[that\\] deprives member states, excluding \\[the\\] two largest \\[Germany and France\\], of their sovereignty\u2026\\[by\\] establishing the superiority of EU institutions over the sovereignty of member states\u201d.\n\nNawrocki said that Poland, and in particular the conservative camp to which he belongs, opposes those trends. He emphasised, however, that this does not make them \u201can enemy of the EU\u201d.\n\n\u201cPoland \u2013 like every member state \u2013 has its own vision of the EU and is entitled to it,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt has the right to strive for the manifestation and adoption of that vision. This is the nature of democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Polish president then outlined his vision of a \u201cPolish programme for the European Union\u201d that would ensure that national member states are \u201cmasters of the \\[EU\\] treaties and the sovereigns deciding on the shape of European integration\u201d, as they are \u201cthe only functioning European democracies\u201d.\n\nNawrocki called for the principle of unanimity to remain in all areas of EU decision-making where it currently applies. That means, in effect, that a single member state can veto change in those areas.\n\nHe also advocated for the EU to maintain the principle that each member state, even the very smallest, has the right to designate a member of the European Commission.\n\nMore controversially, Nawrocki called for the introduction of a prohibition on people being appointed to the highest EU positions without the recommendation of their home country\u2019s government.\n\nIn 2017, Donald Tusk was reappointed as president of the European Council against the opposition of the Polish government, which was led by the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. Nawrocki is aligned with PiS and, like them, is an opponent of Tusk, who is now Poland\u2019s prime minister.\n\nIndeed, in his new proposal, Nawrocki called for the complete abolition of the position of president of the European Council, saying that the role should be carried out by the head of the executive branch of government of whichever member state holds\u00a0[the EU\u2019s rotating presidency](\n\nThis would ensure that the job is done by \u201ca politician with a democratic mandate and political base, rather than a bureaucrat-official dependent on the support of the EU\u2019s greatest powers\u201d.\n\nRotating the position every six months would also prevent the \u201cpermanent dominance of the EU\u2019s \u2018central powers\u2019 and the marginalisation of others\u201d. Likewise, Nawrocki called for the council\u2019s voting system \u201cto eliminate the excessive advantage of large EU countries\u201d.\n\nThe Polish president also proposed that the EU\u2019s competences should be limited to \u201cselected non-ideological areas\u201d, such as economic development and preventing demographic collapse.\n\n\u201cThis means abandoning excessive ambitions to regulate the entire lives of member states and its citizens and the intention of shaping all aspects of politics, sometimes by bypassing or violating the will of the citizens,\u201d said Nawrocki, who also called for the EU not to seek to \u201ccompete with NATO\u201d on security.\n\n\u201cLet me be crystal clear: I am a supporter of Poland in the European Union,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut I believe that issues such as political and justice systems or security are reserved exclusively for the Polish constitution, the Polish president and the Polish government. Just as they should be for every member state.\u201d\n\nWhen PiS was in office between 2015 and 2023, it regularly clashed with Brussels, in particular over its\u00a0[judicial reforms]( The EU accused PiS of threatening the rule of law. Many elements of PiS\u2019s reforms were found by European courts to violate EU law.\n\nPiS argued that the European Commission was overstepping its authority in taking action against Poland, and claimed that it was doing so for political reasons, because it was opposed to right-wing governments that sought to protect national sovereignty.\n\nPoland\u2019s current main ruling party, the centrist, pro-EU Civic Coalition (KO), has regularly accused PiS of pushing Poland towards \u201cPolexit\u201d from the EU, either deliberately or in effect.\n\nLast week, foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski levelled the same accusation against Nawrocki, claiming that his recent\u00a0[speech on Polish Independence Day](\u00a0was intended to \u201cprepare the psychological and political groundwork for leaving the EU, for Polexit\u201d.\n\nIn response to Nawrocki\u2019s speech in Prague, Sikorski issued a brief comment saying that the government \u201chas not authorised the president to submit proposals for amending the European treaties\u201d.\n\nLikewise, interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski stated that, \u201cthe president, by putting forward controversial proposals for changes to the principles of the \\[EU\u2019s\\] functioning, cannot claim to be speaking on behalf of Poland because it is the government that conducts foreign policy\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/25/polands-president-proposes-eu-reform-to-stop-brussels-dictating-terms-to-member-states/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU court orders Poland to recognise same-sex marriages conducted in other member states", "summary": "The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has ruled that Poland must recognise the marriage of a Polish same-sex couple who married in Germany, even though Polish law does not allow such marriages.\n\nThe court found that refusing to do so infringes the freedom to move and reside within the EU as well as the right to respect for private and family life. The ruling requires Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe case in question was brought by two men \u2013 one a Polish citizen, the other a dual Polish-German national \u2013 who married in Berlin in 2018. When they sought to have their union recognised in Poland, they were refused, first by the registry office and then by courts, which cited article 18 of Poland\u2019s constitution.\n\nThat article states: \u201cMarriage as a union of a man and a woman, family, motherhood and parenthood shall be placed under the protection and care of the Republic of Poland.\u201d\n\nBy 2023, the case had reached Poland\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court (NSA), which\u00a0[decided to ask the CJEU](\u00a0to issue a ruling. That decision was itself seen as groundbreaking, as until then Polish courts had refused to refer such cases to the EU level.\n\nIn April this year, CJEU advocate general Richard de la Tour issued an opinion finding that EU law requires member states to recognise same-sex marriages conducted in other member states.\n\nWhile such opinions are not binding, the CJEU usually follows them in its subsequent rulings. And, today, the the court did indeed rule along those lines. Its judges noted that, while individual member states have the right to set their own rules relating to marriage, they are also required to comply with EU law.\n\n\u201cThe spouses in question, as EU citizens, enjoy the freedom to move and reside within the territory of the member states and the right to lead a normal family life when exercising that freedom and upon returning to their member state of origin,\u201d wrote the CJEU.\n\n\u201cIn particular, when they create a family life in a host member state, in particular by virtue of marriage, they must have the certainty to be able to pursue that family life upon returning to their member state of origin,\u201d it added.\n\nRefusing to allow them to do so is contrary to EU law, ruled the judges, as it infringes on their right to move and reside, as well as respect for private and family life.\n\nThe court added that its ruling \u201cdoes not undermine the national identity or pose a threat to the public policy of the spouses\u2019 member state of origin\u201d, and also \u201cdoes not require that member state to provide for marriage between persons of the same sex in its national law\u201d.\n\nIt said that it still remains up to member states what kind of procedure they want to have for recognising marriages conducted abroad. However, that procedure \u201cmust not render such recognition impossible or excessively difficult or discriminate against same-sex couples on account of their sexual orientation\u201d.\n\nPolish LGBT+ rights group Mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 Nie Wyklucza welcomed today\u2019s \u201clong-awaited ruling\u201d, which it said \u201cleaves no doubt: under EU law, Poland is obligated to issue marriage certificates to Polish couples married in another EU country!\u201d\n\nThe organisation will later on Tuesday hold a press conference outside the digital affairs ministry, which is responsible for the process of recognising foreign marriages, to present proposals for how the CJEU\u2019s ruling can be implemented.\n\nPolish law currently does not allow any form of recognised same-sex union. However, opinion polls show that a\u00a0[large majority of the public](\u00a0support the introduction of same-sex civil partnerships.\n\nIn December 2023, the European Court of Human Rights\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0that Poland\u2019s lack of legal recognition and protection for same-sex couples violates their human rights\n\nMost parties in the current rulign coalition\u00a0[favour introducing same-sex civil partnerships]( However, their proposals have faced opposition from more conservative elements in the government and also a certain veto from right-wing, opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki.\n\nLast month, in an effort at compromise, the ruling coalition\u00a0[presented a new bill](\u00a0that would not specifically introduce civil partnerships, but would allow unmarried partners, including same-sex couples, to sign an agreement granting them certain rights.\n\nAfter the plans were unveiled, Nawrocki said that he would not sign any bill that \u201cundermines the unique and constitutionally protected status of marriage\u201d but that he was \u201copen to discussion\u201d about measures to \u201chelp people,\u00a0regardless of their gender, relationships, or age, to manage certain matters\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/25/eu-court-orders-poland-to-recognise-same-sex-marriages-conducted-in-other-member-states/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Syrian security forces use gunfire to disperse rival protests in Alawite heartland", "summary": "Some context: Tens of thousands of Alawites across Latakia, Homs and Tartous gathered jn peaceful protests against continous killings, kidnappings and random dismissal of Alawites from their jobs as well as freedom for more than 9000 Alawites that are being prisoned without a trial for almost a year now (The number is from the Syiran Observarotry for Human Rights).

This anomalous era of extended peace came after two catastrophic wars, each of which was so much more destructive than prior conflicts that historians found it necessary to create an entirely new category to describe them: world wars.\n\nThe absence of great-power wars since 1945 did not happen by accident. The experience of catastrophic war also compelled the architects of the postwar order to attempt to bend the arc of history. American leaders\u2019 personal experiences of winning the war gave them the confidence to think the unthinkable and to do what previous generations had dismissed as undoable by constructing an international order that could bring peace.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, world leaders expected countries to build nuclear weapons as they acquired the technical capability to do so. Kennedy predicted that there would be 25 to 30 nuclear-armed states by the 1970s, which led him to promote one of the boldest initiatives of American foreign policy. Today, 185 states have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty forswearing nuclear weapons. Remarkably, only nine countries have nuclear arsenals. More than 100 countries now have the economic and technical base to build nuclear weapons. Their choice to rely on the security guarantees of others is geostrategically and historically unnatural.\n\nIn 1987, the historian John Lewis Gaddis published a landmark essay titled \u201cThe Long Peace.\u201d arguing that the foundation of this modern long peace was the Cold War. In structural conditions that would in earlier eras almost certainly have led to a third world war, the United States and the Soviet Union confronted each other with arsenals sufficient to withstand a nuclear strike and retaliate decisively. \n\nIn addition to the establishment of the United Nations, the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the multilateral arrangements that eventually developed into the European Union, and the fierce ideological dimension of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry, the central causal factor for peace, Gaddis argued, was the mutual judgment that systemic interests trumped ideological ones. Their desire to prevent mutual destruction was more important.\n\nThe United States launched the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe, established the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to promote global development, and pushed for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to set the rules of economic exchange to promote economic growth. The United States even abandoned its prior strategy of trying to avoid entangling alliances.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, in the early 1990s, triumphalists hailed a new unipolar era in which only the United States remained as a great power. This new order would bring a peace dividend in which countries could flourish without worrying about great-power conflict.\n\nAmong the factors that history shows contribute to the violent end of a major geopolitical cycle, five stand out that could bring the ongoing long peace to a close.\n\n1. At the top of the list is amnesia. Successive generations of American adults, including every serving military officer, have no personal memory of the horrible costs of a great-power war.\n2. The existence of rising competitors also threatens peace. China\u2019s meteoric ascent is challenging U.S. preeminence, echoing the type of fierce rivalry between an established and a rising power that the ancient Greek historian Thucydides warned would lead to conflict.\n3. Global economic leveling further increases the possibility of war. American economic predominance has eroded as other countries have recovered from the devastation of the two world wars. \n4. When an established power also overextends itself militarily\u2014which the US arguably has done\u2014its ability to deter or defend against rising powers weakens.\n5. Finally, the tendency of an established power to descend into bitter political divisions at home paralyzes its ability to act coherently on the world stage. This is unfolding today: an ostensibly well-meaning administration in Washington is upending nearly every existing international relationship, institution, and process to impose its view of how the international order must change.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read the rest of the article here]( in case the original page is inaccessible.", "link": "https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/end-longest-peace", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hamas attack victims sue Binance for allegedly allowing payments to militant group", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/hamas-attack-victims-sue-binance-allegedly-allowing-payments-militant-group-2025-11-24", "author": "None"}, {"title": "RSF announces unilateral three-month \u2018humanitarian truce\u2019 in Sudan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/rsf-announces-unilateral-three-month-humanitarian-truce-in-sudan", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Stellantis to build Leapmotor cars in Brazil", "summary": "", "link": "https://valorinternational.globo.com/business/news/2025/11/19/stellantis-to-build-leapmotor-cars-in-brazil.ghtml", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan: El Fasher Survivors Tell of Deliberate RSF Killings and Sexual Violence \u2013 New Testimony", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/sudan-el-fasher-survivors-tell-of-deliberate-rsf-killings-and-sexual-violence-new-testimony/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
