Following this, for each cluster I extract several documents whose embeddings are closest to the cluster centroids, along with important keywords and key phrases from the cluster, to use in the LLM summarisation prompt.\n\nThis isn't exactly a conventional RAG application since I seek to summarise the entire corpus, but I think it shares enough similarities as to be considered a kind of RAG.\n\nI would be grateful for recommendations on how to improve this procedure. For example, I'm aware that GraphRAG can use community detection to identify clustered concepts.
