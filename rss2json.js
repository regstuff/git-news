What job roles do computational linguists usually take on\u2014do they mostly work as data scientists, research scientists, or software engineers? Also, what are the usual work hours like? Is it a 9-to-5 job, or do workloads tend to fluctuate?\n\nAny insights on the best industries to work in (tech companies, research labs, startups, etc.) and how career growth looks in this field would be greatly appreciated.
