I noticed that Unsloth's code demo has their images named in the PIL format:\n\nPIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x100&gt;\n\nShould I do the same to avoid the error? Currently my images are simply named as \n\n    \"PCSEL_07231209 y 6178.468558138499, 1321.9868470815563, 1.3455746188935184e-12, 3.3911066330076955e-14, 1.161496947225851 x -500.0, 178.6, 59.94, -229.8, -0.03118, -0.04806, 0.251, -41.26.png\"\n\nBTW, my dataset isn't uploaded on HuggingFace. I am simply fulling the data from my local directory. \n\n", "link": "https://i.redd.it/1le8mimaorpe1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump Says India Will be Hit by Reciprocal Tariffs on April 2 - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/trump-says-india-will-be-hit-by-reciprocal-tariffs-on-april-2?srnd=phx-india-v2", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel threatens Gaza's residents with \"complete destruction\" if Hamas doesn't hand over hostages", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-gaza-netzarim-corridor-hamas-war-threat-palestinians-collective-punishment/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How India became an unexpected role model for Europe", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/02/13/how-india-became-an-unexpected-role-model-for-europe", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Record thefts boost North Korea to third-largest bitcoin holder", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/north-korea-bitcoin-third-largest-reserve-world-75qtbgjk6", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thousands protest in Israel over \u2018attack on democracy\u2019 by Netanyahu", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/thousands-protest-in-israel-over-attack-on-democracy-by-netanyahu", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Philippines calls for India to join 'squad' alliance to counter China in Indo-Pacific", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-calls-for-india-to-join-squad-alliance-to-counter-china-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/119231037.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Best Retrieval Methods for RAG", "summary": "Hi everyone. I currently want to integrate medical visit summaries into my LLM chat agent via RAG, and want to find the best document retrieval method to do so.\n\nEach medical visit summary is around 500-2K characters, and has a list of metadata associated with each visit such as patient info (sex, age, height), medical symptom, root cause, and medicine prescribed.\n\nI want to design my document retrieval method such that it weights similarity against the metadata higher than similarity against the raw text. For example, if the chat query references a medical symptom, it should get medical summaries that have the similar medical symptom in the meta data, as opposed to some similarity in the raw text.\n\nI'm wondering if I need to update how I create my embeddings to achieve this or if I need to update the retrieval method itself. I see that its possible to integrate custom retrieval logic here,\u00a0[ but I'm also wondering if this would just be how I structure my embeddings, and then I can call vectorstore.as\\_retriever for my final retriever.\n\nAll help would be appreciated, this is my first RAG application.
