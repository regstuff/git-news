My GPA was only 2.70 because I struggled with a lot of health issues during school. I did a non-accredited \"field school\" in Greece in 2023. I currently have a technician job with the federal government and some connections for CRM jobs. I'm in a pretty good spot with advancing my career in archaeology in the United States.\n\nMy problem is that I've always wanted to work in West or Central Asia/the Ancient Near East. I've spent time in Armenia and loved it, and I'm interested in epigraphy and things more \"classics\" related (although not really Greek or Latin). I didn't know about the divide between so-called \"anthropological archaeology\" and the more pretentious/glamorous archaeologists in different academic departments.\n\nI'm going to have a hard enough time getting into grad school at all with my undergrad GPA. With that plus my meager classics background I have no chance of getting into fancy \"Middle Eastern Archaeology\" programs. And even if I could, I couldn't pay for them without fellowships and fully funded positions that I definitely couldn't get. I don't have any connections and I can't afford do one of those pay-to-play masters programs to beef up my credentials. I don't really know what to do. Should I give up on that aspect of the dream and just focus on \"anthropological archaeology?\" I could be happy doing that I'm sure. But I think I'd always be sad about not going for the full dream.\n\n  \nI was just looking at the University of Chicago programs and.. wow. I would love to take a class on Mesopotamian archaeology and have a requirement of my masters program be the study of an ancient middle eastern language while spending my free time at the Armenian language circle. I just don't see how that could ever be my life given my background and resources.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ii6hj6/feeling_hopeless_about_breaking_into_classical/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What areas of NLP are relatively less-researched?", "summary": "I'm starting my master's thesis soon, and have been interested in NLP for a while, reading a lot of papers about transformers, LLMs, persona-based chatbots, and even quantum algorithms to improve the optimization process of transformers.
