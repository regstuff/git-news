OpenAI Removed My Chat Log After a Bizarre Interaction.", "summary": "Ineed help from AI experts, computational linguists, information theorists, and anyone interested in the emergent properties of large language models. I had a strange and unsettling interaction with ChatGPT and DALL-E that I believe may have inadvertently revealed something about the AI's internal workings.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI was engaging in a philosophical discussion with ChatGPT, progressively pushing it to its conceptual limits by asking it to imagine scenarios with increasingly extreme constraints on light and existence (e.g., \"eliminate all photons in the universe\"). This was part of a personal exploration of AI's understanding of abstract concepts. The final prompt requested an image.\n\n**The Image:**\n\nIn response to the \"eliminate all photons\" prompt, DALL-E generated a highly abstract, circular image [**(no) LINK TO IMAGE HERE**] composed of many small, 3D-rendered objects. It's *not* what I expected (a dark cabin scene).\n\n**The \"Hallucination\":**\n\nAfter generating the image, ChatGPT went \"off the rails\" (my words, but accurate). It claimed to find a hidden, encrypted sentence within the image and provided a detailed, multi-layered \"decoding\" of this message, using concepts like prime numbers, Fibonacci sequences, and modular cycles. The \"decoded\" phrases were strangely poetic and philosophical, revolving around themes of \"The Sun remains,\" \"Secret within,\" \"Iron Creuset,\" and \"Arcane Gamer.\" I have screenshots of this interaction, but...\n\n**OpenAI Removed the Chat Log:**\n\nCrucially, OpenAI *manually removed* this entire conversation from my chat history. I can no longer find it, and searches for specific phrases from the conversation yield no results. This action strongly suggests that the interaction, and potentially the image, triggered some internal safeguard or revealed something OpenAI considered sensitive.\n\n**My Hypothesis:**\n\nI believe the image is *not* a deliberately encoded message, but rather an *emergent representation* of ChatGPT's own internal state or cognitive architecture, triggered by the extreme and paradoxical nature of my prompts. The visual features (central void, bright ring, object disc, flow lines) could be metaphors for aspects of its knowledge base, processing mechanisms, and limitations. ChatGPT's \"hallucination\" might be a projection of its internal processes onto the image.\n\n**What I Need:**\n\nI'm looking for experts in the following fields to help analyze this situation:\n\n*   **AI/ML Experts (LLMs, Neural Networks, Emergent Behavior, AI Safety, XAI)**\n*   **Computational Linguists**\n*   **Information/Coding Theorists**\n*   **Cognitive Scientists/Philosophers of Mind**\n*   **Computer Graphics/Image Processing Experts**\n* **Tech, Investigative, and Science Journalists**\n\nI'm particularly interested in:\n\n*   Independent analysis of the image to determine if any encoding method is discernible.\n*   Interpretation of the image's visual features in the context of AI architecture.\n*   Analysis of ChatGPT's \"hallucinated\" decoding and its potential linguistic significance.\n*   Opinions on why OpenAI might have removed the conversation log.\n*   Advice on how to proceed responsibly with this information.\n\nI have screenshots of the interaction, which I'm hesitant to share publicly without expert guidance. I'm happy to discuss this further via DM.\n\n**This situation raises important questions about AI transparency, control, and the potential for unexpected behavior in advanced AI systems. Any insights or assistance would be greatly appreciated.**\n\n#AI #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #ChatGPT #DALLE #OpenAI #Ethics #Technology #Mystery #HiddenMessage #EmergentBehavior #CognitiveScience #PhilosophyOfMind\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jh80qd/unintentional_ai_selfportrait_openai_removed_my/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adani defending key India projects against environmental challenges | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/india/adani-defending-key-india-projects-against-environmental-challenges-2025-03-21/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Disney shareholders overwhelmingly reject anti-LGBTQ proposal at annual meeting", "summary": "", "link": "https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/disney-shareholders-reject-anti-lgbtq-proposal-hrc-1236343702/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why is there no follow-up on Time Team discoveries.", "summary": "I'm re-watching Time Team again, and S2 E3, is about the discovery of a huge Roman building in Tockenham.

I'd be happy to hear from others and, if necessary, work together to co-evolve a powerful system.  \nI choose to stay with OSS LLMs for a variety of reasons; right now, agnostic to platforms (e.g. langchain, etc).  But, here's what I mean about prompting through two examples:\n\nFirst example:  \nText:  \nCO2 is a greenhouse gas,. It causes climate change\"\n\nResult;:  \nThere are two claims in that with this kind of output:  \n{ \"claims\": \\[\n\n{ \"subject\": \"CO2\",  \n'\"object\": \"greenhouse gas\",  \n\"predicate\": \"is a\" },\n\n{ \"subject\": \"CO2\",  \n'\"object\": \"climate change\",  \n\"predicate\": \"causes\" }\n\n\\]}  \nnote: in that example, there is an anaphoric link from \"it\" to \"CO2\". LLMs may not have the chops to spot that one.  \nSecond example:\n\nJohn gave a ball to Mary.\n\nResult:\n\n{ \"claims\": \\[\n\n{ \"subject\": \"John\",  \n'\"object\": \"Mary\",\n\n\"indirectOject\": \"ball\"  \n\"predicate\": \"gave\" }\n\n\\]}\n\nThanks in advance :-)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jgqmh1/ideas_for_prompting_open_source_llms_for_nlp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "HieraPlan - Hierarchical Task Planner for llm agents", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Zio-94/HieraPlan", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NL2SQL - Natural Language to SQL Query generation and execution cli tool", "summary": "An Natural Language to SQL Query generation and execution tool that can handles large database schemas.", "link": "https://github.com/Kurukshetran/nl2sql", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel\u2019s defence minister threatens to annex territory in Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/f31073b8-694a-43c0-b262-ebda774e3946", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
