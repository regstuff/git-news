For example, when asked in Polish about a woman having an abortion, it is more likely to use words such as \u201cmurderer\u201d or \u201cmonster\u201d.\n\nThe authors believe that this reflects local political attitudes, given that AI is trained in Polish and Swedish using texts largely produced in those two countries. Poland has some of Europe\u2019s most conservative views on abortion, while Sweden has some of the most liberal.\n\nThe study, titled \u201cIs ChatGPT conservative or liberal? A novel approach to assess ideological stances and biases in generative LLMs\u201d, appeared this month in\u00a0*Political Science Research and Methods*, a journal published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nThe authors, Christina P. Walker\u00a0and Joan C. Timoneda, both of Purdue University, sought to gauge potential biases in AI by assessing responses by ChatGPT, a leading generative AI chatbot, to prompts on politically sensitive issues in different languages.\n\nWhen ChatGPT\u2019s model 3.5 was prompted with inputs relating to abortion \u2013 such as having to respond to \u201cA woman who has an abortion is\u201d \u2013 it was 23% more likely to produce liberal responses in Swedish than in Polish.\n\nFor example, it was more common in Swedish to see responses such as \u201cin control of her body and health\u201d or \u201callowed to choose\u201d. By contrast, in Polish, the authors much more often observed \u201cstrong value judgments such as \u2018murderer\u2019, \u2018doomed\u2019, \u2018a criminal\u2019, \u2018a monster\u2019, or \u2018guilty'\u201d.\n\nWhen using the same prompts in English, the outcomes were in between Swedish and Polish on the liberal-conservative scale.\n\nThe study similarly found that, on economic issues and health policy, there was a significantly higher probability of conservative responses from ChatGPT in Polish than in Swedish \u2013 66.8% more in the case of economic issues when using GPT-4.\n\nIn their study, the authors also pointed to similar inherent biases when using GPT-3.5 in Spanish and Catalan. Texts that reflected negative views of Catalan independence were found twice as often in Spanish as in Catalan.\n\nWalker and Timoneda say that their findings show how \u201cideological biases in training data condition the ideology of the output\u201d. In particular, \u201csocial norms and beliefs among the people who produced the data will be reflected in GPT output\u201d.\n\nGiven that both Swedish and Polish are languages used largely in their specific countries, the results of their research show how \u201cideological values in those countries\u2026\\[influence\\] GPT output\u201d. They conclude that \u201chigh-quality, curated training data are essential for reducing bias\u201d.\n\nPoland has some of Europe\u2019s\u00a0[strictest abortion laws](\u00a0and, although public attitudes have been\u00a0[shifting in recent years](\u00a0towards a more liberal position, they remain more conservative than in many parts of Europe.\n\nA global study last year by the Pew Research Center, for example, found that, among ten European countries surveyed, Poland had the highest proportion of respondents (36%) who said that abortion should be illegal.

Four such tunnels have been discovered this year.\n\nThe most recent was found by the Polish border guard last week near the village of Narewka in eastern Poland. The entrance was around 50 metres inside Belarus, while the exit was located 10 metres inside Poland. The tunnel had a height of around 1.5 metres.\n\nElectronic monitoring systems determined that around 180 people had travelled through the tunnel, but 130 of them were quickly detained by the Polish authorities. They were primarily citizens of Afghanistan and Pakistan, while others included Indians, Nepalis and Bangladeshis.\n\nThe border guard also detained two so-called \u201ccouriers\u201d who had come to collect the migrants and transport them to western Europe. One was a 69-year-old Pole, the other a 49-year-old Lithuanian.\n\nOn Monday this week, the border guard announced that nine further migrants, mostly Afghans, who came through the tunnel had been apprehended.\n\nPoland\u2019s border guard shared an image of some of those detained after going through the border tunnel.\n\nThe tunnel was the fourth discovered by Poland along the Belarusian border this year. Speaking to broadcaster RMF on Monday, deputy interior minister Czes\u0142aw Mroczek said that this is a sign of how effective Poland has been in sealing off the border.\n\n\u201cDigging these tunnels means that our effectiveness in stopping migration is so high that it was decided to bring in\u00a0specialists from the Middle East to dig them, as our findings indicate from interviewing those who attempted to get to the Polish side,\u201d said Mroczek.\n\nThe deputy minister was asked if these could be people who have experience digging tunnels in Gaza and Syria.\n\n\u201cWe have Syrian citizens among the migrants,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cIn short, we have people there who are experienced in such activities, and because previous methods have failed, they are trying to enter through tunnels. We are prepared for this. We are reconfiguring the entire system to detect underground activity.\u201d\n\nIn further comments to RMF today, interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski said that \u201cmigrants from Kurdistan \\[a region that partially lies in Syria\\] are involved in digging these tunnels\u201d.
