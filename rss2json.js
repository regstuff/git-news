For example, I compare descriptions like \"Private Label Saltine Crackers\" and \"Branded Original Saltine Crackers\" using cosine similarity based on these embeddings.\n* **Size Comparison**: I also factor in product size (e.g., 16 oz vs. 15 oz) by calculating the Euclidean distance between sizes. This way, similar-sized products get a higher similarity score.\n* **Hybrid Similarity Score**: Finally, I combine the cosine similarity of the product embeddings with the Euclidean distance for size. The goal is to generate a hybrid similarity score to see which branded product a private label might be mimicking.\n\nFor example, if a private label product has a description like \"Private Label Honey Graham Crackers, 14.4 oz\" and there's a branded product like \"Branded Honey Maid Graham Crackers, 14.4 oz,\" the model tries to figure out if they are knockoffs based on the description and size similarity.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this approach!
