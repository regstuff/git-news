I\u2019ve read about various evaluation metrics, and one idea I had was to use the **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)** benchmark, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best choice for this context.\n\nHere are a few specific questions I have:\n\n1. **Is MMLU appropriate for evaluating fine-tuning on models like LLaMA?** The MMLU benchmark seems to cover a wide range of tasks, but I\u2019m not sure if it's suitable for a specialized fine-tuning scenario like mine, or if it\u2019s more appropriate for general language understanding.\n2. **What other metrics or benchmarks would you recommend?** Are there specific evaluation datasets or tools that align better with the goals of fine-tuning a LLaMA model in a particular domain or task?\n3. **Are there any known best practices for evaluating Unsloth fine-tuning?** Since I\u2019m using Unsloth, I\u2019d appreciate any advice or success stories on how others have evaluated their models post-fine-tuning with this framework.\n4. **What\u2019s your process for iterative fine-tuning?** Do you rely on quantitative metrics alone, or do you also incorporate qualitative testing? How do you ensure your model improves without overfitting?\n\nAny advice, tips, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.
