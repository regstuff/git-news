Doubt that's going to help them though. So, in the end, you're basically fucked in terms of technological development and moving up the value chain, unless\n\n1) You are already an East Asian country like Taiwan, Japan and SK who's fate is extremely tied to the US, and supply most of the high value stuff the US consumes. Even then, you're probably not going to move up the value chain into software stuff like design of EDA tools, state of the art LLMs and SaaS, etc. You're probably going to be largely stuck where you are, though that place is pretty high up the value chain.\n\n2) You are a European country/Canada/Mexico, if the US is under democratic leadership.\n\n3) You are under the Chinese sphere of influence, which most south east Asian countries are under.
