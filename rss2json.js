Following the US President's order to prepare for testing and Russia's revocation of the CTBT ratification, the 27-year global moratorium on nuclear explosions is under severe threat.\n\nThe Context: President Trump publicly claimed that Pakistan is actively testing, alongside China and Russia. India, which has not signed the CTBT, maintains a voluntary moratorium (since 1998).\n\nThe central debate is: Should India break this self-imposed restraint to validate its arsenal and secure its deterrence against the backdrop of China's exponentially expanding nuclear force ?\n\n1. The Case for Strategic Action (To Test)\nWhy national security may demand a test:\n\n\u2022 Weapon Validation: Experts state that new testing is needed to definitively validate India's thermonuclear (hydrogen bomb) yield, on which doubts persist.\nThis is crucial for the \"massive retaliation\" threat.\n\n\u2022 Deterrence Against China: China is rapidly expanding its arsenal (expected to reach 1,000 warheads by 2030). Testing new, advanced warheads ensures India's\n\"credible minimum deterrence\" remains credible against this growing disparity.\n\n\u2022 Retained Autonomy: India maintains the full legal and strategic right to test if its\n\"supreme national interests\" require it, as it never ratified the CTBT 1996.\n\n2. The Case for Diplomatic Restraint (Moratorium)\nThe high geopolitical cost of a test:\n\n\u2022 Loss of Image: Breaking the moratorium would shatter India's hard-won reputation as a \"responsible nuclear power,\" eroding global trust and possibly threatening U.S. technology collaboration.\n\n\u2022 Arms Race Trigger: An Indian test would almost certainly compel Pakistan to immediately resume testing, triggering a highly destabilizing regional arms race.\n\n\u2022 Erosion of Norms: India's commitment to the moratorium, even as a non-signatory, has helped maintain the global norm against testing. Breaking it risks global isolation.\n\nLet's Debate: Given the aggressive signaling by the US, Russia, and the expansion by China, is maintaining the NFU (No First Use) doctrine more important than definitively proving the yield of the thermonuclear arsenal ?\n \nWill PM Modi finally test its first nuclear bomb in its entire tenure ?\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1orpgb8/the_nuclear_question_will_global_instability/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India is leading the way with the new \u201cPro Extinction\u201d Movement - thoughts?", "summary": "Based on the idea that life will suffer forever, the Pro Extinction Movement calls for a permanently lifeless world where suffering cannot exist, asserting that anything else would be to unfairly continue condemning life to be born into extreme suffering for the sake of others who are privileged.\n\nSteve Aditya, the founder is from India, as are the majority of the members of the movement, although it is spreading internationally online.

Even though the model-ID is the same.\n\nSame for model configuration - one needs to set things like a reasonable system prompt, context size, etc... but it's also not shared across different direct connections vs. the connection the administrator set up.\n\nCan we get a feature please? That allows, for example, to configure and assign on the model-id per API endpoint level and this is then used for all the direct connections as well?\n\nWould be super helpful and enable a lot of usage scenarios, such as \"yo, we're a close knit group of friends and want to have our own well curated AI server system without everyone having to setup their own stuff\".\n\nMy suggestion:\n\n\\* Add \"Compute Backend\" as an entity and have the administrator setup models per such backend  \n\\* Have access control per API key for the administrator / owner of the API key  \n\\* Share configuration, workspaces, models across instances of the same Compute Backend with different API keys", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1orkzpv/sharing_workspaces_across_users_with_direct/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hey folks!

These are side effects that should be decoupled. I'll move them to separate methods.\n    5. **N+1 Query (moderate_comments):** The loop for comment in self.comments.all(): is inefficient. I'll use a subquery to batch process comments.\n    6. **N+1 Query (get_author_comment_stats):** The method is querying the Comment model directly. I'll fix this to use a subquery on the Comment model.\n    7. **Missing @property (publish_with_tags):** The method is a mutator (modifies the state) and should be a regular method, not a @property.\n    8. **Missing @transaction.atomic (moderate_comments):** The method is doing database writes and external API calls. I'll wrap this in a transaction.\n    9. **Inefficient bulk_update (moderate_comments):** The method is using Comment.objects.bulk_update(...) correctly, so this is fine.\n    10. **Missing @receiver (moderate_comments):** The method is a side effect of a model method.

I am looking at going back to school do a Masters in Computational Linguistics and need some opinions on what programs to look at in Canada and the US. For reference, I have a BA in Linguistics, and I am aware that I will have to take catch up classes in stats/computer programming/etc. \n \nThe main deciding factor other than quality of the program is location. I live in Toronto, Canada, and I would rather not have to relocate unless I absolutely have to (because of family/partner). If absolutely necessary, I would be amenable to relocating within Canada, but I\u2019d rather not move to the US at this point in time. Therefore, I am also focusing my search on programs that are offered online.\n\nHere are some programs I\u2019ve looked at (with pros and cons):  \n- **University of British Columbia - Master of Data Science in CL**: looks very data science heavy, and I\u2019d have to relocate to Vancouver (although only for 10 months). \n- **University of Toronto**: doesn\u2019t have a formal CL Masters program but it seems like you can specialize in it through a MA in Linguistics. Pro is that it\u2019s in Toronto! \n- **University of Washington - MSc in CL**: this program really caught my eye, and it\u2019s offered online! At the end of the program a lot of students opt to do an internship which often really helps with securing a job post graduation. They also seem to have a good set up for students with a linguistics background to get up to speed. \n- Any other online programs in the US? Have I missed any programs in Canada? \n\nThank you all in advance!! \n\n**Note**: I\u2019m *veryyy* lucky and the cost of tuition (Canada vs. US) wouldn\u2019t be a main deciding factor in choosing a program. \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1or84mc/masters_in_computational_linguistics_canada_vs_us/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ancient Murals in Peru Reminded Residents of Climate Crisis", "summary": "", "link": "https://archaeology.org/news/2025/11/06/ancient-murals-in-peru-reminded-residents-of-climate-crisis/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Softwares for automatic Speech Transcription of children with speech disorders", "summary": "Hi!\nI'm new to this subreddit so hopefully this question finds the right ears.\n\nI need to transcribe speech data from a small sample of autistic children with some speech impediments for a research project. \n\nI have 8 videos of 1 hour each, more or less.

When a branch is deleted on the remote, the tool cleans up the local worktree.\n\nIt's built on a space-efficient bare repository model, so it doesn't clone the whole repo for each branch.\n\nI've tried to make it \"safe.\" For example, it won't delete a worktree if it has:\n\n* Uncommitted changes\n* Unpushed commits\n* Stashed changes\n* An ongoing Git operation (like a merge or rebase)\n\n**My question for you all is: what am I not thinking about?**\n\n* Are there major security or workflow pitfalls I'm completely blind to?\n* Have you tried something similar?

It's an open-source AI assistant for Android called Panda. The way it works is pretty neat: you can control your phone just with your voice.\n\nAnd I don't just mean \"set a timer\" or basic commands. It's smart enough to actually use your apps for you. It uses intelligent screen understanding to understand your voice in natural language and execute complex, multi-step tasks across any app.\n\nCheckout this [demo video](\n\nLike, you can literally just watch it:  \n- Open Netflix and play Breaking Bad with just one voice command.\n- Find a video on TikTok about how to tie a tie.
