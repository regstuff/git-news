I attempted dumping the OpenWebUi docs indicated through this tutorial in their docs although ran into issues (It also could have been my embedding model hit it's quota since it's free tier at the moment)\n\n\n\n* What models are you all using as a task model? Currently I'm using gpt-4.1 nano, although I'm open to suggestions! \n\nExcited to hear from you all! And thanks in advance to those that provide your experiences!

I'm looking to create an AI assistant for my personal planner app that has both canvas and g-cal integration, displays assignments, my daily schedule, and an organized calendar. I have already completed most of the UI for my app and the backend is nearly finished as well. I'm currently looking to add an AI agent that I can use to control functionality on my app by running some methods I've created that will edit the UI and also push assignments/events onto g-cal. Basically, I want to have the AI assistant both engage in conversation with me, and generate a formulaic reply that runs some of my methods and is readable by my application. Originally, I thought the best method to get this to work would be fine-tuning an existing LLM with a dataset that I created which replicated the functionality I needed. I also considered the option of simply feeding the API for my app to an LLM and instructing it with how to generate responses. What would you guys recommend in terms of the exact use case I'm trying to fill?
