The crime currently carries a potential jail term of up to two years.\n\nThe ministry says the move is intended to comply with a\u00a0[ruling by the European Court of Human Rights](\u00a0(ECtHR) that Poland violated the rights of a famous pop star, Doda, when she was convicted of blasphemy.\n\nUnder article 196 of Poland\u2019s penal code, it is a crime to \u201coffend the religious feelings of other people by publicly insulting an object of religious worship or a place intended for the public performance of religious rites\u201d. Those found guilty can be fined, given community service, or jailed for up to two years.\n\nThe justice ministry\u00a0[proposes](\u00a0keeping the law on the books, but removing the possibility of a prison sentence for offenders. It says that this solution would \u201cbalance freedom of speech with protection of religious feelings\u201d.\n\n\u201cPoland is absolutely not abandoning its protection of religious feelings, and insulting faith will continue to be punished in accordance with the applicable law,\u201d said justice minister Waldemar \u017burek. \u201cI am a strong supporter of this, although I realise it is an extremely delicate issue and the boundaries are fluid.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, it is necessary to harmonise Polish law with European standards,\u201d he added. \u201cThe changes we are introducing are a response to the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights, not a political decision.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the\u00a0[ECtHR ruled](\u00a0that Poland, where\u00a0[around 70% of people identify as Catholic]( had violated the right to free expression of Dorota Rabczewska, one of Poland\u2019s biggest pop stars, better known by her stage name Doda.\n\nDoda had been found guilty in Poland of offending religious feelings by giving an interview in which she said that it was \u201cdifficult to believe in\u201d the Bible as it was \u201cwritten by someone wasted from drinking wine and smoking weed\u201d.\n\nHowever, it is unclear how \u017burek\u2019s proposed changes to the law would satisfy the ECtHR, given that Doda was not given a prison sentence for her offence. She was fined 5,000 zloty (\u20ac1,187), which the ECtHR deemed a \u201cparticularly severe\u201d punishment. Under \u017burek\u2019s proposals, such fines could still be issued.\n\n[According to the ministry]( between 2020 and 2024, 17 people were given jail terms for offending religious feelings. However, in publicly reported cases, only\u00a0[community service](\u00a0or\u00a0[fines](\u00a0have been issued by courts. Notes from Poland has asked the justice ministry for examples of prison sentences.\n\nThe justice ministry\u2019s proposed changes still face a long, and likely impossible, path to becoming law. They will now be the subject of inter-ministerial and public consultation, after which they must be approved by the cabinet.\n\nThe legislation would then require approval by parliament, where the government has a majority. However, the ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right, contains conservative elements that may not be willing to soften the blasphemy law.\n\nEven if a bill is passed by parliament, it would then require the approval of right-wing President Karol Nawrocki, who has\u00a0[regularly vetoed](\u00a0government legislation. It seems almost certain that he would not sign off on such changes.\n\nIndeed, in 2022, when the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, with which Nawrocki is aligned, was in power, the then justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, proposed\u00a0[moving in the opposite](\u00a0direction, by making the blasphemy law broader and stricter.\n\n\u017burek\u2019s plans to soften the blasphemy law have already been criticised by Ordo Iuris, a prominent conservative legal group. \u201cThe ministry is showing that these types of crimes will not be taken seriously by authorities subordinate to the government,\u201d Ordo Iuris\u2019s J\u0119drzej Jab\u0142o\u0144ski told broadcaster Radio Maryja.\n\nThe changes therefore represent \u201ca form of consent, even tacit encouragement, to commit such crimes, which are being committed in growing numbers\u201d, and will\u00a0\u201cfuel this type of religious unrest in Poland and the attacking of Christians in particular\u201d.\n\nBy contrast, Piotr K\u0142adoczny, a legal scholar at the University of Warsaw and deputy president of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, told the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily that the ministry\u2019s proposals do not go far enough. He called for the blasphemy law to be abolished entirely.\n\nHe noted that other elements of Polish law already criminalise violence, threats or other forms of abuse motivated by religious affiliation, and argued that the law on offending religious sentiment is \u201capplied too broadly by courts and disproportionately violates freedom of expression\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/08/justice-ministry-seeks-to-end-jail-terms-for-blasphemy-in-poland-2/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "(UK) Migration on course to hit 20-year low after visa crackdown", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/08/migration-20-year-low-after-visa-crackdown/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU grants Syria $722 million for recovery, humanitarian aid, von der Leyen says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.gdnonline.com/Details/1372991/EU-grants-Syria-$722-million-for-recovery,-humanitarian-aid,-von-der-Leyen-says", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland\u2019s warring president and PM pledge cooperation on security and Ukraine peace process", "summary": "After holding their first meeting in months, Prime Minister Donald Tusk and opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki have agreed to put aside their differences in other areas in order to pursue a common line on security, including a potential peace deal in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI proposed to the president that in matters directly relating to Poland\u2019s security\u2026there are certain points that require joint action by all Polish institutions,\u201d said Tusk after being hosted by Nawrocki at the presidential palace.

By mid-December, he had vetoed 20 bills \u2013 more than his predecessor, Andrzej Duda, did during his entire ten years in office. Today, shortly before meeting Tusk, Nawrocki issued three more vetoes.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, the prime minister acknowledged that the government and the president would continue to differ on domestic policy issues, as well as many foreign policy ones.\n\nIn another sign of greater cooperation on security issues, last week the government ministers responsible for defence and the security services\u00a0[proposed to hold a meeting](\u00a0with Nawrocki in January.
