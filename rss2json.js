The south was held by the Kingdom of Italy, now aligned with the Allied powers. The north became the Italian Social Republic, a Nazi puppet state still ruled by Benito Mussolini and his fascists. Amid this division, the city of Naples was occupied by Nazi German forces led by Colonel Walter Scholl. The occupation was especially brutal, as Scholl ordered that up to 100 Neapolitans should be executed for every German killed.\n\n\n\nWith tensions rising, on September 27, 1943, the Germans received rumors (later proven to be false) that the Allied forces would be landing at Naples imminently and decided to evacuate the city. Before leaving, they received orders from Hitler to deport the population and destroy the city so it couldn't be used as an Allied stronghold.\n\n\n\nAt this point, the Neapolitans, fed up with the German occupation, indiscriminate killings, and ongoing wartime conditions, revolted. With no central planning or organization, they rose up, raiding armories, freeing prisoners, and sabotaging the German plans. They continued this resistance until Allied troops arrived on the morning of October 1st.\n\n\n\nSource: [\n\n\n\nPhoto Source: [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5vwon", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New discovery: tiny protein called Midkine dismantles the toxic clumps behind Alzheimer\u2019s", "summary": "Summary:\n\nSt. Jude researchers revealed that midkine blocks amyloid beta from forming harmful clumps linked to Alzheimer\u2019s.

Like I think I commented in previous post. I\u2019m a first gen in the US so I\u2019m kinda winging everything and Google has become my best friend.  For the MA programs I have found:\nIn Florida I have found Central Florida, West Florida, Florida state, South Florida. I am super interested in west Florida (the farthest from home within the state) and Central Florida. \nUniversity of north Texas has an online program that helps their out of state students find internships/field work in their areas. \nENMU is another I have found, also offers an online program with the same offers as UNT does. \nAdams state college appeared on my search. Not much info is given which gets me a bit weary, but if anyone has any info on them that would be great. They have a CRM, which seems interesting to me. \nAnother university that has that program is Maryland, also an online program. The potential of not applying for these is high due to maybe needing the background and sadly I got a BA in Psych. \n\nAfter a lengthy talk with the spouse. We have both agreed that my education is main priority and if I need to go rent a room near campus to excel in my program and for me to go back to school, then we\u2019ll figure it out. We\u2019re figuring out the best course of action for deployments due to having two dogs and the 50/50 chance that if I go to be near campus, I might not be able to take them when leaves. That\u2019s also why I am looking at online programs. \n\nThanks everyone! Y\u2019all have been a blessing! \n\n\nPs. If this post makes no sense, I apologize, I am recovering from a nasty sickness.

I'm curious if any other US-based field archaeologists see 1099 contracting as legit and/or have had positive experiences being a 1099 contractor. For fieldwork, specifically.  \n\nPersonally, I have never used 1099 for anything other than super-specialized analysis (at the analyst's request). However, I have chatted with, interviewed, and hired many folks who have worked as 1099 field contractors at other firms. In every single case it has seemed inappropriate if not downright illegal to me, since they were always regular crew members being directed on at least a daily basis, if not hourly task by task basis, by a Project Archaeologist, Crew Chief, PM, or PI employed by the firm. (See: \n\nI have trouble imagining a situation where 1099 would actually be legal/appropriate in field archaeology. In specialized analysis or report writing, where the person sets their own schedule to get a complex long-term task done, sure. But fieldwork... I can't see it. \n\nRight now I view use of 1099 crews as a red flag for a CRM firm and advise up-and-coming archies to avoid that firm. Am I wrong? Have you ever been a 1099 contractor for archaeological fieldwork in a way that felt beneficial to YOU, and not just a way for the firm to avoid liability and HR responsibilities?\n\nPosted in honor of Labor Day. This is all theoretical, since even if someone wanted report an employer to the Dept of Labor or IRS, I doubt anything good would come of it under this administration. More likely ICE would show up at the whistleblower's address.
