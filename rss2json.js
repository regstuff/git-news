And how would be the best approach to make them not only efficient but also to work within the same values of openness, collaboration and sustainability that we share, and we do not see in current available models.\n\n\n\nInspiring initiatives in other fields make us think that there is another way around Big Tech corporations, and we would like to understand the developer perspective on it.\n\n\n\nWe are happy to hear any opinions, discussions, strategic advices, development tips or any other remark shared that you think is essential for developing, deploying and maintaining such an open source AI system for Landscape Architecture.\n\n\n\nFor context, as Landscape Architects, our work is quite broad, from designing green public spaces for cities, to developing city level planning focused on greener, walkable and climate adaptive neighborhoods, to larger regional plans focused on nature and floodplain restoration.\n\n\n\nIn the field of landscape architecture the emergence of the computer and internet changed the profession, and not always for good. We can see the risks of ai, pushing landscape architects to more generic design, quick visual output, efficiency, low cost, etcetera. At the same time we see the opportunity of integrating ever improving climate models, ecology mapping, better understanding how to manipulate the landscape to optimize biodiversity and climate adaptivity. But what about the things that are hard to digitalise? Word to mouth stories, soft values, local culture, local history, seasonality, atmosphere, etcetera? Exactly because landscape architecture is not a very large/profitable market, it\u2019s not likely commercial companies will jump on this. We think it\u2019s worth developing/training an AI for local soft values - run on a solar/hydro powered datacenter. With universities - but we\u2019d need a larger community to make it work.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for any answer \u2013 we will link to this post and fully cite you in the magazine for all the information shared,\n\n\n\nAnd hopefully we can build a collective view on this,\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nSimon", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1f3xeex/how_to_build_open_source_ai_models_for_landscape/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AGI and humanoid robots could create new East India companies", "summary": "Humanoid robots are less in the news than AGI, but they will be equipped with AGI within the end of this decade. \n\n[China is already selling humanoid robots at the price of a family car, around $16,000]( China has also invested in several computers with exaflop capability, alongside producing several leading generative AI models. \n\nThese may look like harmless innovations, however, they have the capacity to weaponize both economics and warfare. \n\nChina is the manufacturing capital of the world, if most of the labor of the world also becomes robotic (as many people estimate, Elon Musk thinks there will be 10 billion robots by 2040), it gives an enormous advantage to China to increase its manpower available for many things. \n\nJobs with a lot of potential for risk, such as mining but also such as warfare could be automated. We could have Indian troops on one side of the Himalayas facing off against humanoid robots on the other side with an unequal advantage. \n\nThe Indian economy could see most of its lucrative IT/ITES sector transformed by AI in the next 5 years. \n\nThere will be a lot more programming being done in the world but by a lot less Indian programmers. Generative AI is widely understood to be good enough already to do 80% of the work, in 5 years or less you could see entire businesses being written with the help of basic instructions in English. \n\nAs robotics increases in the higher income economies you will find the need for immigrants comes down, creating a lot more surplus labor that remains in or returns to India. \n\nEducation becomes a moot point, if there are no jobs waiting on the other side. It takes about 5 to 10 years for our universities to understand market requirements and create a course. The speed of change with the use of AI is so rapid that anything that takes 5 years to design will be obsolete by the time it hits the market. \n\nTo my mind this combination of AGI/generative AI and advanced humanoid robotics is the gunpowder moment of the century. It could very well usher in a new wave of colonization, like it happened with the East India companies. \n\nIndia's calling card to the world is its vast labor force and bank of skilled engineers and doctors. This is made obsolete by such advances in technology.\n\nDriverless taxis are already a reality in several cities of the world. Drone / robotic deliveries of food and groceries too. Anthropic AI generates entire websites with a prompt. [More than 50% of the code on GitHub]( is AI generated (It was 41% last year).\n\nThis reality is about to come to pass as things stand. It's not a certainty, always. There is room for unknown outcomes, but hope is not a strategy. \n\nCurrently we are doing nothing that I know of that can challenge any of this at scale. \n\nWhen the British came to India with their cannons, Indian kings had a few cannons on their side too, but it was no match to the hundreds of cannons the British could array against Indian forces. Indian armies were just discovering gunpowder while the British had already mastered it. \n\nOn the one hand, there will be massive civil unrest due to job shortages and on the other hand there will be a very advanced opponent on the other side of the border.
