Quad was drummed up to a vaccine supply chain alliance where India supported the end production and packaging. \n\nToday, rare earths are in similar situation. West has realized they have handed over a massive lever in Chinese hands. Years of cheap cost and superior quality meant there was no need to look for an alternative. That has conclusively changed. \n\nIndia could be positioned again as the refinement hub for rare earths (side note: As I understand the refinement step is extremely polluting which I think will make Australia and USA outsource this job). The challenge right now is a lot of other countries are trying to insert themselves into this mix (e.g. our ever friendly neighbor). But ofcourse capability ramp up and security is a challenge. Plus most of them EMs are almost vassals of China, so there is a trust deficit on their future availability.
