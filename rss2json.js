The crime currently carries a potential jail term of up to two years.\n\nThe ministry says the move is intended to comply with a\u00a0[ruling by the European Court of Human Rights](\u00a0(ECtHR) that Poland violated the rights of a famous pop star, Doda, when she was convicted of blasphemy.\n\nUnder article 196 of Poland\u2019s penal code, it is a crime to \u201coffend the religious feelings of other people by publicly insulting an object of religious worship or a place intended for the public performance of religious rites\u201d. Those found guilty can be fined, given community service, or jailed for up to two years.\n\nThe justice ministry\u00a0[proposes](\u00a0keeping the law on the books, but removing the possibility of a prison sentence for offenders. It says that this solution would \u201cbalance freedom of speech with protection of religious feelings\u201d.\n\n\u201cPoland is absolutely not abandoning its protection of religious feelings, and insulting faith will continue to be punished in accordance with the applicable law,\u201d said justice minister Waldemar \u017burek. \u201cI am a strong supporter of this, although I realise it is an extremely delicate issue and the boundaries are fluid.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, it is necessary to harmonise Polish law with European standards,\u201d he added. \u201cThe changes we are introducing are a response to the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights, not a political decision.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the\u00a0[ECtHR ruled](\u00a0that Poland, where\u00a0[around 70% of people identify as Catholic]( had violated the right to free expression of Dorota Rabczewska, one of Poland\u2019s biggest pop stars, better known by her stage name Doda.\n\nDoda had been found guilty in Poland of offending religious feelings by giving an interview in which she said that it was \u201cdifficult to believe in\u201d the Bible as it was \u201cwritten by someone wasted from drinking wine and smoking weed\u201d.\n\nHowever, it is unclear how \u017burek\u2019s proposed changes to the law would satisfy the ECtHR, given that Doda was not given a prison sentence for her offence. She was fined 5,000 zloty (\u20ac1,187), which the ECtHR deemed a \u201cparticularly severe\u201d punishment. Under \u017burek\u2019s proposals, such fines could still be issued.\n\n[According to the ministry]( between 2020 and 2024, 17 people were given jail terms for offending religious feelings. However, in publicly reported cases, only\u00a0[community service](\u00a0or\u00a0[fines](\u00a0have been issued by courts. Notes from Poland has asked the justice ministry for examples of prison sentences.\n\nThe justice ministry\u2019s proposed changes still face a long, and likely impossible, path to becoming law. They will now be the subject of inter-ministerial and public consultation, after which they must be approved by the cabinet.\n\nThe legislation would then require approval by parliament, where the government has a majority. However, the ruling coalition, which ranges from left to centre-right, contains conservative elements that may not be willing to soften the blasphemy law.\n\nEven if a bill is passed by parliament, it would then require the approval of right-wing President Karol Nawrocki, who has\u00a0[regularly vetoed](\u00a0government legislation. It seems almost certain that he would not sign off on such changes.\n\nIndeed, in 2022, when the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, with which Nawrocki is aligned, was in power, the then justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, proposed\u00a0[moving in the opposite](\u00a0direction, by making the blasphemy law broader and stricter.\n\n\u017burek\u2019s plans to soften the blasphemy law have already been criticised by Ordo Iuris, a prominent conservative legal group. \u201cThe ministry is showing that these types of crimes will not be taken seriously by authorities subordinate to the government,\u201d Ordo Iuris\u2019s J\u0119drzej Jab\u0142o\u0144ski told broadcaster Radio Maryja.\n\nThe changes therefore represent \u201ca form of consent, even tacit encouragement, to commit such crimes, which are being committed in growing numbers\u201d, and will\u00a0\u201cfuel this type of religious unrest in Poland and the attacking of Christians in particular\u201d.\n\nBy contrast, Piotr K\u0142adoczny, a legal scholar at the University of Warsaw and deputy president of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, told the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily that the ministry\u2019s proposals do not go far enough. He called for the blasphemy law to be abolished entirely.\n\nHe noted that other elements of Polish law already criminalise violence, threats or other forms of abuse motivated by religious affiliation, and argued that the law on offending religious sentiment is \u201capplied too broadly by courts and disproportionately violates freedom of expression\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/08/justice-ministry-seeks-to-end-jail-terms-for-blasphemy-in-poland-2/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland\u2019s warring president and PM pledge cooperation on security and Ukraine peace process", "summary": "After holding their first meeting in months, Prime Minister Donald Tusk and opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki have agreed to put aside their differences in other areas in order to pursue a common line on security, including a potential peace deal in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI proposed to the president that in matters directly relating to Poland\u2019s security\u2026there are certain points that require joint action by all Polish institutions,\u201d said Tusk after being hosted by Nawrocki at the presidential palace.

And it may just strike a deal instead.", "summary": "With Trump \u201cextracting\u201d Maduro from Venezuela in a 3-hours operation, there has been a lot of discussion about what would happen if he were to do something similar to annex Greenland to the US. Any sort of military operation against another NATO member by the US would surely be a first in history and open a new chapter in translatlantic relationships.\n\nAs a European myself, I want to present a different idea: Europe simply cannot defend Greenland from America, even if European states were willing to try (and they are not).\n\nThe first issue is that Europe is completely and utterly dependent on America for defense.\n\nSome observers think that Europe could successfully pull a military defense of Greenland. I\u2019ve even seen circulating ludicrous comparisons between the size and equipments of European armies and the US army.\n\nWell, consider the following:\n\n1. European armies are fully dependent on American intelligence to operate. The majority of high-end ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) assets is provided to European armies by the US. In practical terms, it would be extremely difficult for any European army to conduct any operation beyond national borders without US collaboration. The war in Ukraine itself is still going on because the Ukrainian army receives ISR assets from America.\n\n2. It is highly likely that \u201ckill switches\u201d exist in all American military equipment, including those that have been purchased by European NATO members.\n\n3. Up to two thirds of military equipment in Europe is of American origin. This means it could likely be rendered unoperable remotely via kill switches, in case it was ever to be used against the US. And even if that\u2019s not the case for all equipment, Americans would know what weapons they are dealing with very well, including their weaknesses. It is also known that the \u201cbest\u201d American military equipment is never sold outside of the US but kept for the US army only. It\u2019s the reason why F22s are not for sale, while F35s are.\n\n4. Since WW2, European armies have mostly been deployed in active combat together with the US. They simply lack even basics such as logistics and coordination without \u201cplugging\u201d into the US war machine. The only exceptions are UK and French operations around the world, which sometimes have been run independently (think the Falklands in the 1980s or the French African theaters). But even there, we are either talking about operations against countries without a proper army or war theaters (like the Falklands) where America was supportive.\n\nThe idea that in an invasion of Greenland the Danish army could offer any sort of resistence, or that European armies could coordinate any \u201csupport\u201d independently, is a non-starter. European armies simply do not even exist without American support in their current state. And that assumes they would even want to pick a fight with America, which obviously they don\u2019t want and brings me to my second point.\n\nThe second large issue is that Europe barely wants to support Ukraine, let alone pick a fight with America.\n\nTo actually fight a war, you need the political capital to send warships, planes, mobilize people and turn the economy into a war-ready state. At the moment, there is absolutely no political capital whatsoever for a major military operation in Europe, let alone one against America.\n\nOf course, leaders like Emmanuel Macron are paying a lot of lip service to European integration and to the idea of defending Europe militarly. But look beyond the surface and you see a different reality: recently, the project for a German-French-Spanish fighter jet collapsed because of French wanting more control over it.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about a \u201cEuropean army\u201d since the EU came into existence, yet there has been no progress in over three decades. Why? Because, simply put, the French are never, ever going to give up control of their nukes to a paneuropean army. This in itself is enough to collapse any idea of a European army.\n\nThen you have the issue of military spend. Spain recently cut a deal with NATO to be \u201callowed\u201d to spend less than the 3%-5% of GDP target in defense. Italy is also spending far less than this target, even if the country agreed they will raise spend eventually. On the opposite, countries like Poland and the Baltic states are obviously ramping up military spend, not last because they perfectly know that if Russia ever invades they cannot count on Spain, Italy or France to come to defend them.\n\nThis is all to say that European states are still very much disunited and acting in their own interest, even in matter of defense. There is barely enough political capital to support Ukraine, let alone doing something like standing up to America.\n\nThen there\u2019s economics.\n\nAny kind of open conflict with America would be economic suicide for both America and Europe. Europe and America are economically dependent on each other, to the point this is actually the world\u2019s largest economic relationship in absolute dollar values. Yes, even after tariffs.\n\nAn open conflict would instantly obliterate equity markets on both sides of the ocean, and induce a recession that would make the GFC of 2008 pale in comparison.\n\nIt is simply something impossible to justify to electors, both for Trump (which is much more worried about mid-terms than what he seems) and for European leaders (which are already losing ground to \u201cextremisms\u201d at home).\n\nIf you think Trump really is some loose cannon who doesn\u2019t care about elections and domestic politics, ask yourself why is he going to extreme lengths to approve populist initiatives such as blocking institutional investors from buying homes or capping interest rates on credit cards at 10% for one year.\n\nI think the answer is Mid-Term elections that could give a new Democratic Congress power to permanently sideline the President. Any kind of open conflict with other NATO members wouldn\u2019t play in his favor, to put it lightly.\n\nAlso, Greenland is undefendable.\n\nGreeland is a large mass of scarcely inhabited land with ~50,000 people in it. Oh, and it already has plenty of American military presence on it.\n\nAny kind of military operation to annex it could technically be done overnight and with very few fatatalities, if any. America could technically send a couple of warships to harbor in Greenland\u2019s main villages and say that the country is now a US territory.\n\nBy the time European leaders woke up, called a summit in Paris, took lunch and a bunch of photographs, condemned the gesture and mentioned they are \u201cclosely monitoring the situation\u201d, America could present them with the fait accompli.\n\nThe reason why Trump is unlikely to do so, in my opinion, is not because of lack of military capacity. Nor (obviously) it\u2019s because of international law.\n\nIt is once again because of the possibility of a domestic issue, including a clash with US Congress. Trump knows a violent approach could backfire and come back to him. Also, in case there actually were some fatalities (think a few Danish soldiers stationed in Greenland being killed and mabe killing an American in return), this would have an enormous backlash.\n\nWhat Trump is far more likely to attempt is some form of deal.\n\nThe fact that Europe cannot defend Greenland and that Trump has no interest in an open conflict with Europe brings me to why I think the most likely outcome is not an open conflict of any type.\n\nIf I had to bet, I think what\u2019s most likely to happen over Greenland is either absolutely nothing or some sort of deal with Denmark. Again, consider the following:\n\n1. Historically, Greenlanders have a conflicted relationship with their Danish overlords. Up to not long ago, Greenland was actually seriously evaluating independence over Denmark. It is only after Denmark started to really loosen their grip on Greenland that the sentiment shifted. And by \u2019loosening\u2019, I mean that Greenlanders now get free defense and free money from Denmark in exchange of absolutely nothing at all.\n\n2. American military presence in Greenland is already a reality since post-WW2. Greenland has always been in a strategic geographical location and during WW2 it served as a halfway stop for American planes and troops on their way to the UK and the European war theater. Military presence was actually reduced by America in the decades following the fall of the USSR.\n3. Greenland\u2019s economy is very small and doesn\u2019t have much future in its current form. The country has pushed for tourism in the last few years, but it still remains dependent on transfers from Denmark overall.\n\nWhat would make sense to do, in my view, is some sort of deal that extends American military presence to the economy and the broader society. America could promise significant investment in Greenland in the form of new infrastructure and the opening of future mining operations, in exchange of Denmark giving up in all but name on controlling Greenland.\n\nGreenland could gain a special status as US / EU shared territory, allowing Greenlanders to both legally relocate and visit the EU as well as the USA, while Danish / EU citizens could also be allowed in Greenland without having to fill a normal application for a US visa.\n\nAs part of the deal, Denmark could also agree on the US taking full military control over Greenland\u2019s waters and territory, which is de facto what\u2019s already happening since WW2.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that America could, in theory, literally bribe Greenlanders by offering them up to $1 Million each to vote for independence and annexation, that\u2019s unlikely in my opinion. Once again, it would be a more difficult sell to US voters, as it would be \u2018lost\u2019 money. On the other hand, proposing investments that supposedly will be beneficial for America long term makes more sense. Trump is more likely to take the path of least resistance.\n\nNote: this post is based on an article I posted on my personal Medium, which I\u2019m not linking sine it goes against the rules.
