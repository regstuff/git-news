Shoot me a message if interested.\n* **A Proposed Scope for this Sub** - This sub will focus on the practical *applications* of NLP (Natural Language Processing), which includes anything from Regex &amp; Text Analytics to Transformers &amp; LLMs. Practical LLM discussions definitely have a place here, but conversations that skew too heavily towards hardware/custom LLM development.\n* **Proposed Rules** (would love feedback on these - nothing is set in stone):\n\n1. Be nice: no offensive behavior, insults or attacks\n2. Make your post clear &amp; demonstrate that you have put in effort prior to asking questions.\n3. Limit Self Promotion\n   1. If 95% of your posts are for advertising your content (medium articles, youtube videos, etc), it will be removed. Reach out to Mod Team if you want to be an affiliate sub.\n   2. *Question for readers: Do we want to just include a blanket ban on links from medium/youtube?*\n4. Relevancy - post must be related to Natural Language Processing.\n5. LLM Question Rules: Questions about hardware, custom LLM model development (as in, training a 40B model from scratch), and devops pipelines are probably skewing towards the scope of r/LocalLLaMA.\n   1. *This proposed rule is mostly necessary to redirect folks towards a better response.*\n6.

I have no ill will against them, but users must request access to post - I don't think there's an easy way to get it if you weren't already approved. I would be elated if anyone wants else to take over that sub ( the community skews very academic, so I don't feel very qualified).
