The girl and her mother were burned alive following a rocket strike on residential buildings, according to her school.\n\nOn the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, Russia launched large-scale attacks on Ukraine, involving hundreds of drones and almost 50 missiles. Many strikes took place in western areas hundreds of kilometres from the front line.\n\nTwo residential buildings were hit in Ternopil, killing\u00a0at least 28 people, including three children. Rescuers continue to search for survivors, with many people still missing.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the spokesman for Poland\u2019s foreign ministry, Maciej Wewi\u00f3r, announced that a Polish girl, named Amelia, was one of those \u201cmurdered\u201d by Russia in Ternopil.\n\n\u201cAmong the victims of this brutality is a seven-year-old Polish citizen, Amelka,\u201d he wrote, using the diminutive form of her name. \u201cShe died during the night with her mother.\u201d\n\nWewi\u00f3r added that the ministry remains in contact with the authorities in Ternopil regarding the situation.\n\nLater on Friday, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also addressed the tragedy in a post on social media.\n\n\u201cAmelka was seven years old. Seven. A Polish child. She died in Ternopil during a brutal Russian missile attack,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe will no longer fulfil any of her dreams. This cruel war must end, and Russia cannot win it. Because this is also a war about the future of our children.\u201d\n\nPresident Karol Nawrocki, meanwhile, offered his \u201csincere condolences to the family and loved ones\u201d of Amelia and her mother, \u201cwho perished as a result of the barbaric Russian shelling of civilians\u201d.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the school in Ternopil that Amerlia attended had announced the deaths of her and her mother, Oksana.\n\n\u201cThey were burned alive, hugging each other, as a result of an enemy rocket attack,\u201d wrote the school in a Facebook post, sharing photos of the pair. \u201cOur entire school family mourns the irreparable loss \\[of\\] Amelia, a bright girl, a little angel.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/21/polish-seven-year-old-girl-killed-in-russian-attack-on-ukraine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudanese army advances in Kordofan amid ongoing clashes with RSF", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/sudanese-army-advances-in-kordofan-amid-ongoing-clashes-with-rsf/3750916", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Unmasking a Shadowy Surveillance Empire: How Secret Tech Tracks World Leaders, Journalists, and Individuals", "summary": "", "link": "https://ponderwall.com/index.php/2025/11/22/surveillance-altamides/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How the EPP ushered in a right-wing majority at the European Parliament", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/11/15/how-the-epp-ushered-in-a-right-wing-majority-at-the-european-parliament-in-new-era", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish and German bishops urge \u201cEurope to stand united\u201d in face of \u201cRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine\u201d", "summary": "The Catholic bishops of Poland and Germany have issued a joint call for \u201cEurope to stand united\u201d and not give in to \u201cfatigue\u201d in the face of \u201cthe war being waged by Russia against Ukraine\u201d.\n\nThey also appealed for continued reconciliation between Poland and Germany, condemning \u201cpolitical actors who exploit painful and historically unresolved issues\u201d.\n\nThe church leaders met in Wroc\u0142aw this week to mark the 60th anniversary of a historic letter of reconciliation sent by Polish bishops to their German counterparts in 1965, saying that they \u201cforgive and ask for forgiveness\u201d in relation to the atrocities of World War Two.\n\nIn response, the German bishops wrote that they \u201cgrasp the hands offered\u201d by their Polish counterparts and \u201cask for forgiveness from our neighbours\u201d. They acknowledged that \u201cterrible things have been done to the Polish people by Germans and in the name of the German people\u201d.\n\nThe exchange sparked anger at the time from Poland\u2019s communist rulers, whose propaganda presented West Germany as the country\u2019s continued enemy. They accused the Polish bishops of betraying the national interest.\n\nAs part of their gathering this week, the heads of Poland and Germany\u2019s Catholic episcopates signed a\u00a0[joint declaration]( expressing their desire to continue that process of reconciliation, not only between their two countries but also around Europe and the world.\n\n\u201cWe see \\[the need for\\] this especially in the context of the war being waged by Russia against Ukraine,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are convinced that Europe must stand united against violence. Practical solidarity with the victims of aggression and compassion for all victims of war are essential.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, when signs of fatigue are visible everywhere\u2026we encourage our countries to take every possible action to ensure the survival of the Ukrainian people in this war, to end their suffering, and to contribute to the defence of fundamental values, such as life in freedom and dignity,\u201d added the bishops.\n\nIn their statement, the church leaders also noted that \u201ctensions still exist between our societies\u201d over historical issues. They called for such matters to \u201cbe discussed in a way that fosters reconciliation rather than leads to reopening wounds\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is not primarily about being right, but rather about understanding one\u2019s neighbour and approaching the wrongs inflicted on others with empathy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe process of reconciliation includes\u2026a commitment to understanding, a sincere and truthful look at history, and a willingness to shape the future together.\u201d\n\nThe bishops noted that \u201csome political actors continue to attempt to exploit painful and historically unresolved issues for political gain\u201d. Such \u201cpolitical games based on historical wrongs are contrary to the spirit of reconciliation\u201d.\n\nTheir joint statement comes at a moment of increased recent tensions between Poland and Germany, including over historical issues.\n\nThis week, the latest version of a regular study, the\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*,\u00a0[showed](\u00a0that the proportion of Poles who say they dislike Germans has risen to its highest level in 25 years, while those who say they like Germans has dramatically declined in the last three years.\n\nAmong the most contentious issues is the question of war reparations, with Poland\u2019s former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government\u00a0[launching a claim in 2022](\u00a0for $1.3 trillion in compensation from Germany.
