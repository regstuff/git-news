Why I said it seems to learn nothing, because:\n\nI tried to not load  the checkpoint of pretained model, and keep the require\\_grad= False, so the Bertmodel cannot learn. And the acc on validation is exactly the same with when I load the checkpoint.  I'm pretty sure, the model load the checkpoint correctly and it also be trained correctly.\n\nHere are some results:  \nQQP: 35.7 QNLI:56.3 SST2:59.3 CoLA:69.1 STSB\uff1a-2.5\n\nAfter see the results, I tried to average pool instead  CLS:\n\nHere I finetune all the parameters and use average pool in STSB.\n\n[2025-09-26 17:30:54] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[0/360], Train loss :1.754, Train spearmanr_co: -0.299\n\n[2025-09-26 17:31:34] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[50/360], Train loss :0.734, Train spearmanr_co: 0.640\n\n[2025-09-26 17:32:16] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[100/360], Train loss :0.829, Train spearmanr_co: 0.612\n\n[2025-09-26 17:32:55] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[150/360], Train loss :1.057, Train spearmanr_co: 0.115\n\n[2025-09-26 17:33:37] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[200/360], Train loss :0.985, Train spearmanr_co: -0.155\n\n[2025-09-26 17:34:19] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[250/360], Train loss :1.301, Train spearmanr_co: 0.195\n\n[2025-09-26 17:35:00] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[300/360], Train loss :1.137, Train spearmanr_co: 0.220\n\n[2025-09-26 17:35:42] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Batch[350/360], Train loss :0.842, Train spearmanr_co: 0.180\n\n[2025-09-26 17:35:48] - INFO: Epoch: 0, Train loss: 2.489, Epoch time = 295.313s\n\n[2025-09-26 17:36:11] - INFO: Accuracy on val 0.048\n\n[2025-09-26 17:36:12] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[0/360], Train loss :1.106, Train spearmanr_co: -0.160\n\n[2025-09-26 17:36:55] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[50/360], Train loss :1.474, Train spearmanr_co: 0.015\n\n[2025-09-26 17:37:34] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[100/360], Train loss :1.093, Train spearmanr_co: -0.121\n\n[2025-09-26 17:38:15] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[150/360], Train loss :1.393, Train spearmanr_co: 0.165\n\n[2025-09-26 17:38:57] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[200/360], Train loss :1.554, Train spearmanr_co: -0.352\n\n[2025-09-26 17:39:39] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[250/360], Train loss :1.015, Train spearmanr_co: -0.559\n\n[2025-09-26 17:40:18] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[300/360], Train loss :0.858, Train spearmanr_co: 0.311\n\n[2025-09-26 17:40:59] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Batch[350/360], Train loss :1.347, Train spearmanr_co: -0.254\n\n[2025-09-26 17:41:07] - INFO: Epoch: 1, Train loss: 2.257, Epoch time = 295.491s\n\n[2025-09-26 17:41:30] - INFO: Accuracy on val 0.095\n\n[2025-09-26 17:41:31] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[0/360], Train loss :0.976, Train spearmanr_co: -0.081\n\n[2025-09-26 17:42:11] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[50/360], Train loss :1.244, Train spearmanr_co: -0.225\n\n[2025-09-26 17:42:53] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[100/360], Train loss :0.982, Train spearmanr_co: 0.094\n\n[2025-09-26 17:43:33] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[150/360], Train loss :1.629, Train spearmanr_co: -0.570\n\n[2025-09-26 17:44:15] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[200/360], Train loss :1.112, Train spearmanr_co: 0.130\n\n[2025-09-26 17:44:55] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[250/360], Train loss :1.483, Train spearmanr_co: 0.071\n\n[2025-09-26 17:45:36] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[300/360], Train loss :0.813, Train spearmanr_co: 0.030\n\n[2025-09-26 17:46:19] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Batch[350/360], Train loss :0.882, Train spearmanr_co: 0.560\n\n[2025-09-26 17:46:26] - INFO: Epoch: 2, Train loss: 2.215, Epoch time = 295.913s\n\n[2025-09-26 17:46:49] - INFO: Accuracy on val 0.038\n\n  \nI'm not sure the bad performance is because my pretrained checkpoint or something wrong  during finetuning.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nr8ats/why_my_bert_had_a_bad_performance_on_glue/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "RAG, docling, tika, or just default with .md files?", "summary": "I used docling to convert a simple PDF into a 665kb markdown file.
