My interests lean towards industry rather than the civil service.\n\nI had originally been looking at language and speech processing courses and have been taking programming courses over the last year or so in anticipation of a masters in this area.

This is a minus for me, however there is a clear focus on compling, NLP, etc., which I feel makes it potentially a safer bet than the forensic linguistics course in terms of prospects in industry and also transferable data and computer science skills.

To be fair, over the past decade, the U.S. has made some concessions in areas like the South China Sea, the Diaoyu Islands, and the Taiwan Strait, but it's still not enough. I get that the U.S. feels a lot of anxiety and insecurity about this situation, but I suggest they take a serious look at how the Soviet Union and Russia have consistently made geopolitical concessions to China since the 1980s.\n\nOverall, these geopolitical concessions haven't caused Russia serious losses, and China has been quite restrained in its actions. In the end, both countries achieved a win-win situation. When you compare this to the negative consequences of Russia's concessions to NATO in Europe, which led to a disastrous outcome for both sides, the adjustments in the China-Russia geopolitical strategy in Asia are pretty remarkable. It's a classic example of a skilled strategist achieving success without making a big fuss.\n\nIn the past, Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia created significant fear for China. Eventually, the Soviet Union was forced to withdraw its troops, and then China rose to power. According to many Western strategists, since Mongolia is so close and could easily fall under Chinese control\u2014especially after causing such a psychological burden\u2014China would likely intervene aggressively to make it a vassal state. This would pose a serious threat to Russia's national security. In reality, since the 1990s, many U.S. politicians have claimed that a significant geopolitical reconciliation between China and Russia was impossible. But what actually happened? China managed to keep its cool, even after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, maintaining stability in Outer Mongolia.\n\nThe Soviet-supported Vietnam was worn down by China in a long war of attrition, leading the Soviet Union to ultimately withdraw its support for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, resulting in Vietnam\u2019s military withdrawal and a basic capitulation. After that, the Soviet Union collapsed and could no longer provide economic assistance. According to the traditional thinking of many Western strategists, this would mean that China would push Russian influence out of Southeast Asia. However, the reality is that China only pursued limited objectives: peaceful land and maritime borders, territorial demarcation, and Cambodian independence. Subsequently, Vietnam and Russia maintained a long-term good relationship, and China remained tolerant, even when Vietnam heavily purchased arms from Russia and seemed to seek some balance against China in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan was one of the three conditions China proposed for normalizing Sino-Soviet relations in the 1980s. After the Soviet withdrawal, did the U.S. and China team up to turn Afghanistan into their sphere of influence? That never happened. After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan became an international wasteland for a time that everyone ignored until 9/11. It makes sense that the U.S. wasn\u2019t paying attention to Afghanistan in the 1990s\u2014it was just too far from their key interests. But China, which is right next to Afghanistan, also turned a blind eye. In the 1990s, extremist forces were rampant and even affected China, but China only tightened its domestic borders and didn\u2019t attempt to intervene in Afghan affairs.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea lost its economic support, and its limited external economic security mainly came from China, while its external political backing for security also primarily came from China. In the earlier six-party talks, Russia was involved but played a minor role. According to traditional Western strategic thinking, since the Korean Peninsula is so important to China, with Russia's influence waning, China should be unwilling to see Russia strengthen its relationship with North Korea, which would dilute China's vested interests. However, after the Russia-Ukraine war, Russia actually strengthened its ties with North Korea, and China allowed it to happen.\n\nCentral Asia was originally Russia\u2019s territory. Many strategists have speculated that significant geopolitical conflicts would arise between China and Russia over Central Asia. Now, a generation later, what\u2019s happened? China's influence in Central Asia has expanded tremendously, but this expansion has been very slow and patient, often considerate of Russia's face, and many times has been opportunistic. So, even though the accumulated advantages for China are substantial, Sino-Russian relations haven\u2019t faced any major shocks.\n\nI think these examples are quite educational. The Russians have realized that dealing with the Chinese isn't nearly as scary as dealing with the Westerners. Americans should understand that engaging with China is far more stable than engaging with Russia. China can maintain long-term composure or gradually infiltrate your sphere of influence while making the process mostly painless for you (giving you a long adaptation period and plenty of face), and it will also allow you to exert reverse geopolitical influence without undermining overall stability.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1faefvy/the_india_and_us_should_seriously_study_russias/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Secured a CRM Interview!

[ - During WW2, they switched production from rail cars to war heads &amp; various Military Equipment.

[ -   \n  \nThe Budd Company operated a hot cell facility in Philadelphia from l956 through l967 to manufacture sealed sources for use in industrial radiography. (A hot cell is a heavily shielded enclosure in which radioactive materials are handled by persons using remote manipulators, such as mechanical arms, and viewed through shielded windows or periscopes.) A small amount of unsealed cesium-137 was also used for a brief time at the facility.  \n  \nIn addition, we also have Laramie Road.

I bought my 1st home in 2004, in the 19115, When they got old &amp; sick, I had to move back in w/ them &amp; keep my home vacant.  We wanted to prevent them from going into a nursing home, and also having the nursing home take away their home. We had nurses, round the clock for 24 hours. I was not embarrassed living with my parents.  I actually enjoyed it very much.  We would eat dinner together every day.  We never argued.  My whole life I was never yelled at.  They were a lot older than me, and as their age progressed, things became tough.  I had to cook for them 3 meals a day, and do everything for them... because I didn't want to put them in a nursing home.  One time, my vegan diet gave my father low iron, low hemoglobin (which requires a blood transfusion to fix immediately), it makes you weak, and you can't move.... So, I had to sleep on the floor next to him for a month. I didn't know about the Nutrition Tracking Meal Diary Cell Phone Free App called [www.cronometer.com](www.cronometer.com) at that time.

The financial assistance was crucial for the American colonists in their fight against British rule. Here are the details of how the money was distributed:  \n  \nFinancial Agreements: In February 1778, France and the United States signed the Treaty of Alliance, formally allying France with the American colonists. As part of this agreement, France pledged its support, including financial aid, to the United States.  \n  \nLoans: France provided substantial loans to the United States to fund their war efforts. The most significant loan came in 1778 when the French government arranged a loan of 2 million livres (a French currency) from the French banking house of Le Couteulx et Cie. This initial loan was followed by additional loans, including a total of 10 million livres in 1779 and 24 million livres in 1780.  \n  \nSupplies and Military Aid: In addition to financial assistance, France also provided military supplies and aid to the American colonists. The French Navy played a crucial role in the war by assisting in naval blockades and engaging in key battles, such as the Battle of Yorktown in 1781, which was a decisive victory for the Americans. The French military support included troops, warships, weapons, and ammunition.  \n  \nBenjamin Franklin's Role: Benjamin Franklin, the American envoy to France, played a significant role in negotiating and securing French support. He worked closely with the French government to secure financial aid and other resources for the American cause. Franklin's diplomacy and influence were instrumental in obtaining French assistance.  \n  \nDistribution of Funds: The funds received from France were primarily managed by the Continental Congress, the governing body of the American colonies during the Revolutionary War. Congress used the funds to pay for various war-related expenses, such as purchasing supplies, equipping troops, and maintaining military operations. Some funds were also used to pay off existing debts.  \n  \nIt is important to note that while Louis XVI and France's support was crucial for the American cause, the financial aid alone did not guarantee victory in the war. The American colonists faced numerous challenges throughout the conflict, and the outcome of the war was determined by a combination of factors, including military strategy, perseverance, and the support of other nations such as Spain and the Netherlands.  \n  \n\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34  \n  \n\u26a1 Family Relationships of France &amp; England    \n  \nLouis XVI's wife, Marie Antoinette, and King George III's wife, Queen Charlotte, were sisters-in-law as they both came from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine through their mother, Maria Theresa. This made Louis XVI and King George III brothers-in-law by marriage.  \n  \nIn addition, there were also related by blood by former ancestors.  \n  \nThe British and French royal families have a long history of intermarriage, resulting in blood connections between the two dynasties. Here are some key relationships that link the British and French royal families:  \n  \nThe House of Stuart and the House of Bourbon: One significant connection between the two royal families was through the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, a member of the Stuart dynasty, to Francis II of France, who belonged to the House of Valois-Bourbon. Their son, James VI of Scotland (later James I of England and Ireland), became the first monarch of the Stuart dynasty to rule over England and Scotland, effectively uniting the crowns from 1567 to 1625.  \n  \nThe House of Hanover and the House of Bourbon: The Hanoverian dynasty in Britain began with the accession of George I in 1714. The Hanoverians were related to the French Bourbon dynasty through Sophia of Hanover, whose mother was Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James VI and I. Sophia's uncle, Charles I of England and Scotland, married Henrietta Maria of France, a member of the House of Bourbon. Therefore, there was a blood connection between the Hanoverians and Bourbons through the Stuart lineage.  \n  \nThe House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the House of Orl\u00e9ans: In the 19th century, the British royal family, known as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later renamed the House of Windsor), had a connection to the French royal family through Queen Victoria. In 1840, Victoria married Prince Albert, who was a member of the German noble House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Their daughter, Princess Victoria, married Prince Louis of Battenberg, whose mother was a member of the House of Orl\u00e9ans, a branch of the French royal family.  \n  \nEdward III and Isabella of France: Edward III of England, who reigned from 1327 to 1377, was married to Philippa of Hainault. However, a significant blood connection between the British and French royal families came through Edward III's mother, Isabella of France. Isabella was the daughter of King Philip IV of France, making Edward III a grandson of a French king.  \n  \nThese are only a few examples of how the British and French royal families were related.   \n  \nWhile these connections highlight the historical ties between the British, The Royal Family, and French royal families, it is important to note that they represent a small portion of the complex web of intermarriages among European royal houses throughout history. The relationships between the two dynasties were often influenced by political considerations, diplomatic alliances, and the desire to strengthen familial connections among European monarchies.  \n  \nMatt Falcone - [  \n215-888-8080  \n[MF@LaserLightShow.ORG](mailto:MF@LaserLightShow.ORG)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1fank6p/maps_of_history_the_house_of_orleans_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Treasury recovers $1.3 billion in unpaid taxes from high wealth tax dodgers", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/treasury-recovers-13-billion-unpaid-taxes-high-wealth-113457963", "author": "None"}, {"title": "All Newborns in IL to get testing for rare genetic disorder thanks to suburban family, early life detection allows for minimal impact later in life", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/all-illinois-newborns-to-be-screened-for-genetic-disorder-thanks-to-oswego-family/3538266/?amp=1&amp;os=io..&amp;ref=app", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prehistoric Tuscany", "summary": "Hi all, I am interested in books or papers describing pre-Etruscan societies of Tuscany.
