It has a developing set of moderation capabilities but what makes it stand out, is the ability to develop complete personas or personalities. \n\nThe bot can literally change personalities for every channel in the server and they can be as rich and as diverse as you'd like. While many other areas of the AI market focus on data, statistics, and analytics, I wanted to focus on more of a whimsical side of the human condition within the AI in terms of creating a fun environment for people to interact in. \n\nPlease take a look at the project and leave me some feedback. Please consider leaving a star and perhaps sponsoring it if you feel it is worth it. \n\nThank you.", "link": "https://github.com/rapmd73/Companion", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Xi Jinping arrives in France with Ukraine and EU trade row at top of agenda", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/06/xi-jinping-europe-visit-france-macron-ukraine-eu-trade", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ASEAN, India strengthen strategic partnership amidst regional tensions", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/diplomacy/asean-india-strengthen-strategic-partnership-amidst-regional-tensions/2072010/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India ranks 7th on climate change performance index, up 1 spot from last report", "summary": "India ranked 7th in this year\u2019s Climate Change Performance Index, up one spot from the previous one, and also remained among the highest performers", "link": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-ranks-7th-on-climate-change-performance-index-up-1-spot-from-last-report-2473903-2023-12-09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Vast Iron Age necropolis uncovered in Amorosi", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.heritagedaily.com/2024/05/vast-iron-age-necropolis-uncovered-in-amorosi/151856", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A new ChatGPT learning platform.", "summary": "", "link": "/r/ChatGPT/comments/1clbsyy/a_new_chatgpt_learning_platform/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian troop attacked a Ukrainian trench whilst being shot at by their own tank.", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.upilink.in/russian-troop-attacked-a-ukrainian-trench-whilst-being-shot-at-by-their-own-tank-20789.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hungary will not extradite military-age Ukrainian men", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/05/6/7454453/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In medieval England, leprosy spread between red squirrels and people, genome evidence shows", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1clevhe/in_medieval_england_leprosy_spread_between_red/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Falklands dispute may last decades - Argentina president", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce43zv3qln9o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Could I still do Archaeology?", "summary": "  So this may be stupid and to much planning ahead, but i\u2019m 16 and I\u2019m going to be a junior next year and that\u2019s when they want us to start picking careers to make the next years of our lives about; and I\u2019ve always been interested in the past (to mean animals, ancient civilizations, and old architecture). \n  Now, without saying to much, I wanted to go to school for that kind of stuff but it\u2019s not looking likely so I was just going to see about art.\n\n Anyways, is it still possible to research archaeology, go on digs, and have opinions without going to college for a degree in the subject; or I guess another question is, how do I start studying archaeology without college (or before)?\n\n(And what are some books I can read to get a better understanding of archaeological concepts, finds, techniques, and work?)\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1clu8w6/could_i_still_do_archaeology/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Heavy rains cause deadly flooding in southern Brazil", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazil-rain-flood-rio-grande-do-sul-1.7195015", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Maldives urges Indians to 'be a part' of its tourism, says country's economy 'depends' on it", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/maldives-urges-indians-to-be-a-part-of-its-tourism-says-countrys-economy-depends-on-it/articleshow/109890969.cms?from=mdr", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hamas says it accepts ceasefire proposal of Egypt, Qatar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-says-it-accepts-ceasefire-proposal-egypt-qatar-2024-05-06/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs wins NBA Rookie of the Year award", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs wins NBA Rookie of the Year award</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvc3BvcnQvdmljdG9yLXdlbWJhbnlhbWEtbmJhLXJvb2tpZS1vZi15ZWFyLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVZodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L3Nwb3J0L3ZpY3Rvci13ZW1iYW55YW1hLW5iYS1yb29raWUtb2YteWVhci1zcHQtaW50bA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-05-07", "author": "None"}]}}};
