We are \\sim88\\% reliant on imported oil and \\mathbf{100\\%} dependent on foreign sources for essential minerals. Our diplomatic corps faces agonizing choices to keep the country running.\n\nCan we afford to grow this fast when our lifeline is controlled by others?\n\n1 - The Geopolitical levers :\nActions that define India's diplomatic strength:\n\nStrategic Arbitrage: Massive increase in discounted Russian oil (\\sim\\mathbf{38\\%} of imports) balances Western pressure\nagainst national economic need.\n\nMineral Diplomacy: State-led efforts (KABIL) to acquire mining assets in Latin America/Africa directly challenge China's control over critical mineral supply chains, a security-driven move.\n\n2 - The Security costs \nRealities that expose India's external dependence:\n\nSupply Chain Exposure: Total import reliance for key minerals leaves defense and high-tech sectors exposed. Data - Over 70% of our Lithium imports currently originate from China.\n\nDiplomatic Friction: Every strategic resource deal creates friction with a key partner (e.g., US tension over Russian oil). Autonomy comes at a cost.\n\nLet's Debate: Is India's aggressive resource diplomacy primarily a necessary act of national security or a high-stakes gamble in the global power competition ?\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1omgw0u/securing_the_future_is_india_winning_the_global/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A boy who created 3D-printed safety whistles to help stranded mountaineers in emergencies has received a national award.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz0xyl3nypro", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Facebook Messenger Clone for PC (since the app is going extinct in December)", "summary": "So (Using ChatGPT) I recreated the Facebook Messenger app, It's basically just the same as the original one, but instead of using Microsoft Edge, it opens links in your default browser.", "link": "https://github.com/Deinasas/Messenger-Clone", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A little horror game that runs in the terminal", "summary": "It's an old project, made with python.
