It ordered Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe European court emphasised, however, that its ruling \u201cdoes not require the member state to provide for marriage between persons of the same sex in its national law\u201d. It also said that the decision \u201cdoes not undermine national identity or pose a threat to public policy\u201d.\n\nBut those arguments have been questioned by COMECE, which argues that the CJEU\u2019s decision threatens to interfere with the right, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, for national governments to regulate issues relating to marriages and families.\n\nThe EU ruling \u201cimpoverishes the meaning\u201d of this guarantee \u201cby underlining that in exercising this competence, each member state must comply with EU law,\u201d wrote the bishops.\n\nCOMECE also said that the CJEU had given a \u201cdisappointingly limited role to the respect for member states\u2019 \u2018national identities\u2019\u201d. It argued that, \u201cfor some member states, the definition of marriage forms part of their national identity\u201d.\n\nPoland is one of the EU\u2019s most religious member states, with around\u00a0[70% of its population identifying as Catholic]( The preamble to the country\u2019s constitution refers to \u201cour culture rooted in the Christian heritage of the nation\u201d.\n\n[Polling](\u00a0by the Ipsos research agency this year found that only a minority of Poles, 31%, support the introduction of same-sex marriage. However, a majority, 62%, were in favour of allowing some form of legal recognition of same-sex relationships.\n\nIn their statement, COMECE expressed concern that the CJEU\u2019s latest ruling \u201cwill have an impact on national family law legal systems and may foster pressure to amend them\u201d.\n\nIt \u201ceffectively creates a convergence of matrimonial-law effects, even though the \\[European\\] Union does not have a mandate to harmonise family law\u201d, say the bishops. They also worry that the ruling could \u201cpave the way to future similar legal approaches regarding surrogacy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of judgements give rise to anti-European sentiments in member states and can be easily instrumentalised,\u201d they conclude.\n\nThe CJEU\u2019s ruling requires Poland to introduce recognition of same-sex marriages conducted in other member states. If the country does not, it could face ongoing fines until it does so.\n\nThe Polish government has\u00a0[indicated that it will respect the ruling]( However, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also declared that \u201cthe EU cannot impose anything on us on this issue\u201d and \u201cwherever matters must be decided by the nation state and national law, we will adhere to this principle\u201d.\n\nEven before the ruling, the government had\u00a0[presented a bill](\u00a0intended to allow unmarried partners, including same-sex couples, to sign an agreement granting them certain rights.\n\nHowever, it has not yet been approved by parliament and, even if it is, faces a potential veto from conservative, opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, who has said he will not support any measures that \u201cundermine the unique and constitutionally protected status of marriage\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/09/catholic-bishops-voice-concern-over-eu-court-order-for-poland-to-recognise-same-sex-marriages/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018The patriarchy runs deep\u2019: women still getting a raw deal in the workplace as equality remains a dream", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/10/women-workplace-equality-gender-world-un-report", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
