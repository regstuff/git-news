I can go to places like Anthrosource or Linkedin to look for jobs more local here and I've sent plenty of applications to any job I could just barely fit into. Haven't heard back from any of course. The rest want like 3 years of experience but would still pay you like you're a greenhorn. The closest job I could apply to is doing archeaology in the Channel Islands but wants \"*demonstrated experience with performing archaeological studies on California Channel Islands*\" like they're just flirtatiously looking for specifically one guy who fits.\n\nMy current plan is just to build up volunteer experience, but boy I wish my profs were more straightforward of the reality of the situation and were more detailed on how to get these jobs.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ibbhrw/revised_as_per_no_memes_rule_i_was_pretty/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland warns against restarting Russia gas supplies", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m5p21pmy2o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Speculation rife over coup against Bangladesh army chief", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/speculation-rife-over-coup-against-bangladesh-army-chief/articleshow/117583519.cms", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
