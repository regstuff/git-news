If found guilty of violating Poland\u2019s sanctions law, they will be jailed for at least three years.\n\nOn Wednesday, Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency (ABW) and National Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PK) announced that they had last week detained the six suspects, all of whom were residing in Poland, during a coordinated series of raids.\n\nThe suspects are accused of attempting to smuggle to Russia, via Belarus, a device used to automate the production of integrated circuits that can be used, among other things, for the assembly of combat drones.\n\nProsecutors note that the\u00a0National Revenue Administration (KAS), Poland\u2019s tax and customs administration agency, initially thwarted the attempt to smuggle the device. That in turn \u201ccontributed to the disruption of potential deliveries of military equipment to Russian troops operating in eastern Ukraine\u201d.\n\nThe six suspects were, on the day of their arrest, charged with a variety of crimes, including under Poland\u2019s law, passed in April 2022 in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, punishing those who support the aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe legislation, which was also intended to protect Poland\u2019s own national security, includes a ban on the export of strategically important equipment that could be used in the production of military technology. Anyone guilty of doing so receives a jail sentence of at least three years.\n\nThe same law was\u00a0[used earlier this month](\u00a0to charge five people with smuggling cigarettes from Belarus to Poland using weather balloons. Prosecutors say that the gang\u2019s actions helped support Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine by providing income to Belarus, which is an ally of Moscow.\n\nAmong the six suspects detained last week, three\u00a0have been placed in court-ordered pretrial detention, which is often done if someone is believed to be a security threat or flight risk. The other three have been released on bail, but are banned from leaving the country and will be under police supervision.\n\nRussia has used drones extensively in Ukraine for both military purposes but also in attacks on civilian targets, such as\u00a0[residential buildings](\u00a0and\u00a0[energy infrastructure](\n\nOn one night in September last year,\u00a0[around 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace](\u00a0in an unprecedented violation.
