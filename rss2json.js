He is accused of organising and directing a spy ring whose members \u2013 mostly Ukrainians and Belarusians \u2013 were convicted in Poland in 2023.\n\nInvestigators believe that the man, a 28-year-old called Mikhail Mirgorodsky, coordinated intelligence activities in Poland via the Telegram messaging service, including surveillance of military sites, attempted sabotage, and dissemination of pro-Russian propaganda.\n\nThey filed five charges against Mirgorodsky, including for establishing and leading an organised criminal group of a terrorist nature, conducting foreign intelligence operations, and financing terrorist crimes. The first charge carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe case forms part of a wider investigation into a Russian network active in Poland.\n\nIn mid-2023, Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency (ABW) detained 16 people (13 Ukrainians, two Belarusians and one Russian) who were, in December that year,\u00a0[convicted](\u00a0of carrying out espionage, sabotage and propaganda activities on behalf of Russia.\n\nProsecutors say that further investigation into the group led them to find that Mirgorodsky was responsible for coordinating their activities.\n\nAccording to the charges, Mirgorodsky instructed the group of at least 30 members to monitor military vehicles and infrastructure, install GPS tracking devices and data transmitters, and distribute pro-Russian and anti-NATO leaflets.\n\nHe is also accused of inciting an attempted derailment of a train, an act classified as a terrorist offence, and of inciting members of the network to use violence and threats against Ukrainians and Belarusian dissidents and set fire to their property.\n\nThe suspect is not in Poland, and prosecutors say they have been unable to question him. A court in Lublin approved a request for pretrial detention in August, and authorities have issued a domestic arrest warrant and are seeking an Interpol Red Notice.\n\nIn a separate statement, the ABW also revealed today that seven other members of the network run by Mirgorodsky are being charged: one Pole, one Lithuanian, three Belarusians, one Ukrainian, and another Russian\n\n\u201cFurther actions are also underway to identify at least six additional individuals,\u201d they added.\n\nThey ABW also noted that the group \u201cwas formed with the direct support and at the request of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, which provided funding and technical support\u201d.\n\nMirgorodsky\u2019s expertise in cryptocurrency was used by the FSB to help facilitate payments to their operatives.\n\nSince 2023, Poland has been hit by a wave of other espionage and sabotage activities\u00a0[carried out largely by Ukrainian and Belarusian](\u00a0immigrants on behalf of Russia,\n\nIncidents have included a series of arson attacks, including one that\u00a0[destroyed Warsaw\u2019s biggest shipping centre]( and, most recently,\u00a0[sabotage of a rail line](\u00a0running between Warsaw and Lublin.\n\nIn response, the Polish government has successively closed down all three of Russia\u2019s consulates operating in Poland, first in\u00a0[Pozna\u0144](\u00a0last year, followed by\u00a0[Krak\u00f3w](\u00a0and\u00a0[Gda\u0144sk](\u00a0this year.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/02/poland-charges-russian-with-orchestrating-sabotage-network/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yemen\u2019s Houthis release mariners held since July ship attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/yemen-ship-houthis-release-mariners-eternity-54d87ebd3c8c36d5a2b8216b9386b404", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Exclusive drone footage shows devastated Ukrainian town almost encircled by Russian forces", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/myrnohrad-russia-ukraine-war-front-drone-footage-9d72a97db13980d6d599a3a60c2d1598", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
