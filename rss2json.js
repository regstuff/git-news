Increased presence of military in the region, Pakistan going through its economic crisis among the primary ones but one of the major factors among that was also the fact that then Army Chief Qamar Bajwa wanted normalised relations with India. There were even reports of backdoor channel talks at NSA levels between India and Pakistan during this period.\n\nThat changed when Bajwa was succeeded by Asim Munir. Asim Munir is an ideological man. He believes in two nations theory. He believes in Islamic supremacy. His talk to Pakistan diaspora was already a warning which India did not pay enough attention to and as a result we got Pahelgam massacre.\n\n4 months later, Asim Munir reaping the rewards of his gamble. He is \"promoted\" to Field Marshal. Pakistan is slowly ending its isolation due to better relations with USA and Saudi Arabia (There are definitely causal links between Operation Sindoor and the recent geopolitical waves but I am not going to delve on that in this post). How much of this will meaningfully translate to Pakistan's well-being in the long run only time will tell but what it definitely does is, it gives more leverage and validation to Asim Munir's propaganda and his methods to Pakistan public. They definitely think that he's their messiah now and he can do no wrong. This will embolden him to take even more risks like Pahelgam.\n\nIf you think India was isolated during Operation Sindoor, imagine what happens after the next, say even bigger, terrorist attack. The first thing that will happen is backdoor arm-twisting by Saudi Arabia and USA for India to not escalate the tensions. Operation Sindoor did not achieve enough strategic deterrents, in my opinion and India caved under the pressure for the early ceasefire before achieving strategic goals (Destroying 2-3 strategic airbases at the cost losing expensive military hardware is not achieving goals). \n\nFollowing this reasoning, what's to stop Asim Munir from escalating this nonsense? We already seeing multiple ceasefire violations at the LOC. Traditionally, these have been used to smuggle more terrorists under the cover fire into India.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1nqvpvu/likely_india_will_soon_be_subjected_to_another/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Speech2Touch: Adding Voice Control to your office's Coffee Machine", "summary": "This was a fun embedded systems side project I worked on for a month or so.\n\nThe repository contains firmware for an embedded device to convert Voice Commands into USB HID packets to control a coffee machine without any modifications to the hardware or software of the coffee machine.   \n  \nThe board is based on an STM32WB55 Nucleo.

The latter chamber is responsible, among other things, for validating election results.\n\nThe disputed body, known as the chamber of extraordinary review and public affairs, was created by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government as part of its contested overhaul of the judiciary.\n\nIts legitimacy has previously been rejected by both the\u00a0[Court of Justice of the European Union](\u00a0and the\u00a0[European Court of Human Rights](\n\nThat is because the chamber is filled exclusively with judges nominated by the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), the body responsible for judicial nominations, after it was also overhauled by PiS in a manner deemed to have\u00a0[rendered it illegitimate](\u00a0due to it being under greater political influence.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, another part of the Supreme Court, its labour chamber, issued a resolution in response to a complaint brought by employees of a company that had been subject to a ruling by the extraordinary review chamber.\n\nA panel of seven labour chamber judges \u2013 all of whom were appointed before the KRS was overhauled by PiS \u2013 found that a ruling issued with the participation of even one judge appointed by the reformed KRS should be regarded as \u201cnon-existent and as never having happened\u201d.\n\nIn issuing its decision, the labour chamber referred to a\u00a0[ruling from earlier this month by the CJEU](\u00a0that confirmed the illegitimacy of the extraordinary review chamber and said that its judgments should be regarded as \u201cnull and void\u201d.\n\n\u201cCourts must meet all requirements established at the EU level,\u201d wrote the presiding judge, Dawid Mi\u0105sik, quoted by the\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*\u00a0daily. \u201cAn \\[extraordinary review chamber\\] panel that includes even one improperly appointed judge does not meet this requirement.\u201d\n\n\n\nBecause all judges on the extraordinary review chamber were appointed after the overhaul of the KRS that rendered it illegitimate, Mi\u0105sik\u2019s remarks effectively refer to all rulings the chamber has issued.\n\n\u201cWherever we are dealing with a judgment of a non-court, a national court has the option of using this EU remedy,\u201d said Mi\u0105sik. However, he added that, for now, \u201cthis remedy has rather narrowly defined boundaries\u2026\\[and\\] concerns the court of last resort in a given country\u201d.\n\nAmong the rulings issued by the extraordinary review chamber are ones\u00a0[confirming the validity of elections]( including the 2023 parliamentary elections that saw PiS replaced in power by the current ruling coalition and this year\u2019s presidential election that was won by PiS-backed candidate Karol Nawrocki.\n\nMiko\u0142aj Malecki, a legal scholar at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, commented that, although the \u201cforce of the \\[labour chamber\u2019s\\] resolution is formally narrow\u201d, it is possible to imagine the same principle being applied more broadly, including regarding rulings on the validity of elections.\n\n\n\nKamila Borszowska-Moszowska, a district court judge appointed after the KRS was overhauled by PiS, condemned the labour chamber\u2019s resolution, saying that it was both legally unjustified and would result in \u201cchaos\u201d.\n\nShe noted that, under Poland\u2019s constitution, it is the president who appoints judges (after they have been nominated by the KRS) and that the Supreme Court does not have the right to challenge such decisions nor to question the status of other courts.\n\nA PiS MP, Krzysztof Szczucki, also condemned the labour chamber\u2019s decision, saying that it was a further example of judges trying to \u201cusurp the competencies of other bodies\u201d.\n\n\n\nHowever, the justice minister, Waldemar \u017burek, welcomed the resolution, which he said confirmed the government\u2019s position that \u201cthe chamber of extraordinary review and public affairs, in a composition that includes even one judge appointed by the neo-KRS, does not meet the criteria of a court within the meaning of EU law\u201d.\n\nWhen it came to power in 2023, the current government pledged to restore the rule of law and efficacy of the courts by reversing many of PiS\u2019s judicial reforms. That has included\u00a0[proposing measures](\u00a0to deal with the roughly 2,500 judges at various levels nominated by the KRS after it was overhauled.\n\nHowever, it has made little progress in that regard, in some cases due to opposition from former PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda but in many others because the coalition has not agreed on measures to put to parliament.\n\nAn opinion poll\u00a0[published last week](\u00a0found that the proportion of Poles who say they distrust their country\u2019s courts has now risen to 57%, the highest level ever recorded and up from 41% when PiS left office in 2023.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/25/polish-supreme-court-chamber-says-rulings-of-other-chamber-non-existent-due-to-illegitimate-judges/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
