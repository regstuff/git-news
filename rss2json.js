The dataset includes 10,000 unique labels, and my goal is to recommend the top 5 labels for every abstract.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Abstract:** Kimic Chemitech (S) Pte. Ltd. is a provider of chemicals that support water and wastewater treatment systems, and laboratory equipment and consumables.\n* **Labels:** \\['Laboratories--Furniture, equipment, etc.', 'Chemicals'\\] (\n\nI plan to use both sparse and dense embeddings for this task:\n\n* **Dense embeddings:** I'm considering using models like SBERT or others from MTEB, combined with FAISS for approximate nearest neighbors search to retrieve the top labels based on cosine similarity.\n* **Sparse embeddings:** I'm thinking of employing BM25 for keyword search functionality. I want to use BM25, but I'm wondering if I need to use Elasticsearch or something similar. Is there a way to implement BM25 purely in Python using open-source tools?\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. How can I effectively combine both sparse and dense embeddings to improve the accuracy of label recommendations?\n2. For integrating sparse embeddings with BM25, should I consider a weighted combination and normalization of the importance assigned to each approach before combining them?\n3. Do I use Sparse Embeddings before or after Dense Embeddings?\n4. Is it advisable or necessary to use XGBoost or a Cross Encoder in the final step of label recommendation?\n5. Do I need to rely on systems like Elasticsearch for implementing BM25, or are there alternative methods available in Python?\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cco9uk/seeking_expert_advice_optimizing_label/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Make No Mistake, Russia Values China Over India", "summary": "", "link": "https://nationalinterest.org/feature/make-no-mistake-russia-values-china-over-india-210448", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Why no ambassador or embassy in Israel until 1992?\u2019, asks S Jaishankar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-no-ambassador-or-embassy-in-israel-until-1992-asks-s-jaishankar-101713889634739.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland ready to help Ukraine to get military-age men back, minister says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-ready-help-ukraine-get-military-age-men-back-minister-says-2024-04-24/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Speech-to-Speech Model", "summary": "Is there an AI model for speech-to-speech conversion?
