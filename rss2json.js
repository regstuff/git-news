Trento, on the other hand, is more research-oriented but includes an almost year-long mandatory internship, unlike the other universities. Additionally, the Trento program only accepts 80 students per year, making it seem much more \"exclusive.\" After completing this program, one is practically already on the path to a PhD in Computational Linguistics or Artificial Intelligence.

In my current company I could probably explore coding/data science a little over the coming year, but I don\u2019t enjoy working there very much.\n\nSo I can either accept Edinburgh now and take the leap into NLP, or take a year to learn some more about it, maybe find another job in in the meantime and apply to some other Masters programs next year (Applied linguistics at Cambridge seems cool, but as I understand more academic and less vocational than Edinburgh\u2019s course). Would the sudden jump into NLP be too much? (I could still try and brush up over summer) Or should I take a year out of uni? Another concern is that I am already 24, and don\u2019t want to leave the masters too late.
