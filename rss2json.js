Warsaw made that move in response to evidence that Russia was behind the sabotage of a Polish rail line earlier this month.\n\nThe decisions mean that, by the end of December, neither country will have any consulates operating in the other, leaving only their embassies open.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian foreign ministry announced that it had summoned Polish\u00a0[ambassador Krzysztof Krajewski](\u00a0to hand him a note informing Poland that, in response to the\u00a0[closure of the Gda\u0144sk consulate]( it was ordering the reciprocal closure of the Polish diplomatic facility in Irkutsk.\n\nThe two consulates are the last ones each country is operating in the other. Previously, Poland ordered Russia to close its consulates in\u00a0[Pozna\u0144](\u00a0and\u00a0[Krak\u00f3w](\u00a0due to Moscow\u2019s campaign of sabotage. Russia responded by closing Poland\u2019s consulates in Saint Petersburg and Kaliningrad.\n\nIn its announcement today, the Russian foreign ministry called Poland\u2019s decision to close the Gda\u0144sk consulate \u201can openly hostile and unjustified step\u201d, reports the TASS news agency.\n\n\u201cThe Russian side once again reminds those who, for the sake of momentary political expediency, are seeking unfriendly attacks against our country: the Russian Federation will not allow such actions to go unanswered,\u201d it added.\n\nAt the time of writing, Poland\u2019s foreign ministry had not commented on Russia\u2019s decision. However, Tomasz Siemoniak, the minister in charge of Poland\u2019s security services, said that Warsaw \u201chad expected this\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is simply a reaction to our actions, although our actions were related to the fact that we have no doubt that the Russian security services are responsible for the acts of sabotage, including the recent ones, hence the consulate\u2019s closure,\u201d said Siemoniak, quoted by the Wirtuana Polska news website.\n\nHe noted that the consulate in Irkutsk has played an important role of its connection to the history of Poles exiled by the Soviets to Siberia.\n\nOn 16 November, damage was discovered at two points on a rail line running between Warsaw and the eastern city of Lublin. The following day, Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u00a0[confirmed](\u00a0that it had been caused by sabotage, including through an explosive device.\n\nOn 18 November, Tusk\u00a0[announced\u00a0]( the attack had been carried out by two Ukrainians working on behalf of Russia, who then immediately fled over the border into Belarus.\n\nProsecutors have drafted charges against the pair and Poland issued a diplomatic note to Belarus asking that it hand them over. However, given Belarus\u2019s close relationship with Russia, the prospects of extradition appear slim. This week, another Ukrainian man was\u00a0[charged](\u00a0with assisting the saboteurs.\n\nPoland has in recent years been hit with a\u00a0[series of acts of sabotage](\u00a0carried out by operatives \u2013 often\u00a0[Ukrainians and Belarusians](\u00a0\u2013 recruited by Russia.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/27/russia-closes-last-polish-consulate-in-tit-for-tat-move/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump hands Putin Ukraine\u2019s occupied territories || US president sends envoys to Moscow with peace plan that recognises Russia\u2019s war gains", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/11/28/trump-to-recognise-occupied-ukraine-part-of-russia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Talks That Could Have Ended the War in Ukraine", "summary": "[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1p8s5wl/the_talks_that_could_have_ended_the_war_in_ukraine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pope Leo begins first foreign trip as Catholic leader in Turkiye, Lebanon", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/27/pope-leo-heads-to-turkiye-lebanon-in-first-foreign-trip-as-catholic", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland picks Sweden to supply submarines for its navy", "summary": "Poland has chosen Sweden as its preferred supplier of new submarines for the Polish navy. It intends to buy three A26 submarines from Swedish manufacturer Saab. The brand-new model, designed in particular for Baltic Sea operations, has not yet gone into service.\n\n\u201cTogether, Sweden and Poland will take greater responsibility for security in the Baltic Sea,\u201d said Sweden\u2019s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, celebrating the news. \u201cIn a time of uncertainty for our entire region, we are now strengthening our part of the world together.\u201d\n\nSeven manufacturers from six countries \u2013 Germany, Italy, France, Spain and South Korea, as well as Sweden \u2013 bid to be the supplier for Poland\u2019s Orka programme, which aims to modernise the Polish naval fleet.\n\nPoland currently only has one submarine, a 40-year-old Soviet-era vessel that is in need of constant repair.\n\nAt a cabinet meeting today, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that Sweden had been selected as the preferred supplier. The defence minister, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, said that they hoped to conclude an intergovernmental agreement with Sweden on the purchase \u201cwithin weeks\u201d.\n\n\u201cSweden presented the best offer according to\u2026an objective analysis of all criteria, including delivery time, price, value, and operational capability, especially in the Baltic Sea basin,\u201d said Kosiniak-Kamysz. \u201cSweden\u2019s offer was the only one that met all expectations.\u201d\n\nA key requirement was also \u201cacquiring additional skills for the Polish shipbuilding industry\u201d, and here the proposals \u201cfrom Sweden were the most far-reaching regarding investments in the Polish arms industry, servicing, and repairs\u201d, added the minister, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nIn a statement, Saab confirmed that their \u201cproposal includes cooperation with the Polish industry and knowledge transfer, securing a strategic partnership between Poland and Sweden\u201d.\n\nThe extent and nature of this partnership have not yet been revealed. But a Polish deputy defence minister, Cezary Tomczyk, claimed that \u201cSweden will invest hundreds of millions of zloty in the Polish shipbuilding industry.\n\nThe overall value of the deal has also not yet been confirmed, with Kosiniak-Kamysz saying it would be finalised after a final agreement is concluded. Saab\u2019s CEO, Micael Johansson, says that the firm is \u201clooking forward to the coming negotiations\u201d over the final terms of the deal.\n\nThere is also, as yet, no planned delivery date for Poland\u2019s submarines. However, Sweden\u2019s offer includes giving Polish sailors access from 2027 to more modern training ships in preparation for when the new submarines are ready.\n\nCurrently, the Polish navy\u2019s only submarine is the\u00a0*Orze\u0142*. Built in 1986, it is the oldest Kilo-class Soviet submarine still in service anywhere in the world and regularly breaks down.\n\nThis week, the\u00a0*Orze\u0142*\u00a0was meant to take part in celebrations of Poland\u2019s Navy Day on 28 November, but it \u201csuffered a malfunction\u201d that prevented it from leaving port, a navy press officer told news website Interia.\n\nBy contrast, Saab calls the A26\u00a0*Blekinge*\\-class \u201cthe world\u2019s most modern submarine\u201d. However, its development has faced repeated delays and cost overruns.\n\nIn 2015, the Swedish armed forces ordered two of the vessels, which were initially meant to be delivered between 2022 and 2024. However, that date has continually been pushed back, and delivery is now expected between 2031 and 2033.\n\nThe A26 is specifically designed for operations in the Baltic Sea, including protecting critical underwater infrastructure such as cables and pipelines. Its stealth systems are intended to make it very difficult to detect in the shallow Baltic waters.\n\nSpeaking to broadcaster TVN, however, Kosiniak-Kamysz noted that the new submarines would be capable of operating in various waters, not just the Baltic.\n\nIn recent years, Poland has\u00a0[increasingly oriented itself towards the Baltic region]( forming closer economic, energy and military ties with the Baltic and Nordic states.\n\nLast year, Poland and Sweden\u00a0[signed](\u00a0a strategic partnership on defence and economic ties.

WILAYAT GHARB IFRIQIYYA (ISWAP)\n\nDATE 2016\n\nSTATES\n\nBorno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe and Bauchi\n\nREASON\n\nIn August 2016, ISIS publicly removed Abubakar Shekau as the leader of its West African branch and appointed Abu Musab al-Barnawi (the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf) as the new leader of ISWAP (Wilayat Gharb Ifriqiyya). Shekau rejected ISIS's decision, leading to a violent split between his loyalists (who retained the Boko Haram/JAS name) and ISWAP loyalists (who followed al-Barnawi under ISIS's command).\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nConcentrated in the Lake Chad Basin, Sambisa Forest, Alagarno, and the Timbuktu Triangle (border of Borno/Yobe). They reportedly have \"total control\" over some Local Government Areas (LGAS) like Marte, as well as bases around Damboa, Dikwa, Rann, New Marte, and near the Cameroon border (e.g., Wulgo)\n\n5. MAHMUDA\n\nDATE 2018\n\nSTATES Kwara\n\nREASON\n\nIt emerged around 2018-2019, following internal power struggles within ISWAP between loyalists of Abu Musab al-Barnawi and hardline commanders aligned with Shekau's JAS faction.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nThe leader, Mallam Mahmuda, reportedly leads a cell in and around the Kainji National Park (Niger/Kwara border). A group identified as 'Mahmuda' was specifically mentioned in a recent (April 2025) attack on Duruma village in Karonji, Baruten LGA, Kwara State.\n\n6. BAKURA DORO FACTION\n\nDATE 2021\n\nSTATES\n\nNasarawa, Kogi, FCT and Niger\n\nREASON\n\nFollowing Shekau's death, Bakura Doro, also known as Bakura Sahalaba, a senior Boko Haram commander, refused to join ISWAP and instead established his own splinter faction. This group became known as the Bakura Faction or Bakura Group, composed mainly of loyalists from the Lake Chad Basin and remnants of Shekau's fighters.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nBarwa territory along the tri-border area of Nigeria, Niger, and Chad.\n\n7. WULOWULO\n\nDATE 2025\n\nSTATES\n\nKwara and Nasarawa\n\nREASON\n\nTo extend the reach of Boko Haram beyond the North East.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Sule mentioned increasing insecurity, including killings in Kokona Local Government Area (specifically Ndama village) and abductions in Lafia and Karu Local Government Areas.\n\n\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_\n\nBoko Haram's fragmentation is a complex legacy of ideological rifts and leadership struggles, producing numerous splinter factions like ISWAP and Ansaru. The recent emergence of the 'Wulowulo' faction in Nasarawa and Kwara states, as cited by Governor Abdullahi Sule, exemplifies this persistent evolution. This spread into Nigeria's Northcentral region underscores the group's adaptive nature and marks a significant geographical expansion of the security threat beyond its traditional strongholds in the Northeast.\n\nSources: SBM Violence Tracker, Media reports", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2025/10/boko-haram-as-a-hydra/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
