LLM-based reranking kicks in only when needed (when candidates exceed 50% of retrieval limit), which keeps costs down while maintaining quality.\n\n**Background consolidation**\n\nMemory operations happen after responses complete, so there's no blocking. The LLM analyzes context and generates CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE operations that get validated before execution.\n\n**Skip detection**\n\nTwo-stage filtering prevents unnecessary processing:\n\n* Regex patterns catch technical content immediately (code, logs, commands, URLs)\n* Semantic classification identifies instructions, calculations, translations, and grammar requests\n\nThis alone eliminates most non-personal messages before any expensive operations run.\n\n**Caching strategy**\n\nThree separate caches (embeddings, retrieval results, memory lookups) with LRU eviction. Each user gets isolated storage, and cache invalidation happens automatically after memory operations.\n\n**Status emissions**\n\nThe system emits progress messages during operations (retrieval progress, consolidation status, operation counts) so users know what's happening without verbose logging.\n\n# Configuration\n\nDefault settings work out of the box, but everything's adjustable through valves, more through constants in the code.\n\n    model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite (LLM for consolidation/reranking)\n    embedding_model: gte-multilingual-base (sentence transformer)\n    max_memories_returned: 10 (context injection limit)\n    semantic_retrieval_threshold: 0.5 (minimum similarity)\n    enable_llm_reranking: true (smart reranking toggle)\n    llm_reranking_trigger_multiplier: 0.5 (when to activate LLM)\n\n# Memory quality controls\n\nThe consolidation prompt enforces specific rules:\n\n* Only store significant facts with lasting relevance\n* Capture temporal information (dates, transitions, history)\n* Enrich entities with descriptive context\n* Combine related facts into cohesive memories\n* Convert superseded facts to past tense with date ranges\n\nThis prevents memory bloat from trivial details while maintaining rich, contextual information.\n\n# How it works\n\n**Inlet (during chat):**\n\n1. Check skip conditions\n2. Retrieve relevant memories via semantic search\n3. Apply LLM reranking if candidate count is high\n4. Inject memories into context\n\n**Outlet (after response):**\n\n1. Launch background consolidation task\n2. Collect candidate memories (relaxed threshold)\n3. Generate operations via LLM\n4. Execute validated operations\n5. Clear affected caches\n\n# Language support\n\nPrompts and logic are language-agnostic. It processes any input language but stores memories in English for consistency.\n\n# LLM Support\n\nTested with gemini 2.5 flash-lite, gpt-5-nano, qwen3-instruct, and magistral. Should work with any model that supports structured outputs.\n\n# Embedding model support\n\nSupports any sentence-transformers model. The default gte-multilingual-base works well for diverse languages and is efficient enough for real-time use.
