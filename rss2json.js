I wanted to share it today because I've recently started to get really involved in the project and I'm also starting to think that it could probably evolve into something much more exciting :) I'm in my third year of programming studies and I find it quite slow and repetitive, so I decided to learn lots of new things on the side in my free time to become a better programmer. I'm mainly doing this project to explore the different principles and architectures surrounding the design of systems of this kind, and I've made a lot of progress in the last few days! Today, I'm posting my project here because I feel that my project isn't perfect and that there are several things that could be critical and improved! I'm primarily looking for feedback (via GitHub) and interaction if any of you are interested and see potential in my ambitions. With that said, thank you for reading my post to the end and I wish you a very nice day.
