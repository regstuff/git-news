Web Speech API SpeechRecognition is picking up TTS output \u2014 how do I stop it?", "summary": "Hey folks,\n\nI'm building a conversational agent in **React** using the **Web Speech API**, combining SpeechSynthesis for text-to-speech and SpeechRecognition for voice input. It kind of works... but there's one major problem:\n\nWhenever the bot speaks, the microphone picks up the TTS output and starts processing it \u2014 basically, it listens to itself instead of the user   \n  \nIm wondering if there's:\n\n* A clever workaround using Web Audio API to filter/suppress the bot's own speech\n* A way to distinguish between human voice and TTS in the browser\n* Ideally, I'd like a real-time, browser-based solution with a natural back-and-forth flow (like a voice assistant). \n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1lctdun/help_web_speech_api_speechrecognition_is_picking/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Langfuse and OWUI - can't see RAG &lt;context&gt; in LLM traces?", "summary": "Hi all - looking for a bit of help here...
