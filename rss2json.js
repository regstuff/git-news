I tried many more (VOSK, Google Assistant, Picovoice, AssemblyAI, and others), but they are either not good enough for production or aren't good for my use case.\n\nAt the beginning, Fireworks was the best among cloud engines (Siri is on-device, so it's hard to match its performance) - fast, precise (with a prompt), and reliable.\n\nBut starting from November 12, I started to receive complaints from my users about Fireworks not responding sporadically and not providing any transcriptions.\n\nAfter contacting support, they confirmed an unusual pattern of open vs. active connections that started abruptly on November 12. They assumed \"changes on my side\" as a cause.\n\nSince my app is mobile (gradual releases) and I didn't do any releases on the 12th, the pattern was a clear indication of an error on their side.\n\nOn November 20, I provided them with a minimal reproducible example that reproduced the error in isolation. They confirmed the issue after running my code only after 4 days (on the 24th) and after 3 daily emails that went unanswered.\n\nSince then, I've been writing to their support every few days. They haven't fixed the issue. They provided a workaround - checking whether the service is unresponsive and reconnecting - but, as you might guess, it's far from an acceptable solution for a real-time application.\n\nSo in short, they could be a great service: fast, cheap, and precise. But until they fix both their service, their processes, and their support, stay away.\n\nThe issue should've been detected and fixed in hours, or maybe in a day, with a rollback.

One member's economy was larger than all the other four members combined. Should voting power reflect economic weight or should all members have equal stakes?\n\nThey chose equal stakes and each country got the same voting share regardless of GDP. The bank presidency would rotate, starting with the second largest economy, then the third largest, and so on. Makes no sense, like why would the economically dominant member accept dilution of its control when it had the leverage to demand proportional representation?\n\nA recent academic study examines the strategic logic behind this decision through the lens of rational institutionalism. The argument is that the dominant power made tactical concessions on governance to achieve a larger strategic objective, preserving the institution's legitimacy as genuine multilateralism rather than a hegemonic tool.\n\nBRICS was founded in 2006 when global power dynamics looked different and it emerged partly as a platform for rising economies to collectively push back against Western dominated institutions like the World Bank and IMF. The whole point was to create an alternative model of development finance that didn't replicate the problems these countries saw in Bretton Woods institutions.\n\nIf the New Development Bank had been structured with the largest economy having veto power and dominant control, it would have looked too much like the very system BRICS was supposedly offering an alternative to undermining the entire value proposition.\n\nSo the dominant power initially opposed equal stakes in behind the scenes negotiations but ultimately accepted it and the study frames this as sacrificing primacy for legitimacy. The institution works better as a counterweight to Western financial architecture if it can credibly claim to be consensual and equitable.\n\nOther member countries with smaller economies stay engaged partly because the governance structure gives them real voice despite growing power asymmetries. If the dominant economy could unilaterally rewrite rules, smaller members might exit or reduce commitment but the equal stakes model keeps everyone invested.\n\nThis matters for understanding how new multilateral institutions function differently from older ones. The post-World War II system was largely designed by and for Western powers with weighted voting that reflected their dominance. Newer institutions founded by rising economies in the 21st century often adopt more egalitarian governance models, not purely out of idealism but because it serves the strategic interests of founding members to create genuine alternatives. As long as the dominant member continues to value the legitimacy benefits and other members continue to extract voice and constraint mechanisms from participation, the institution survives.\n\nEmpirically, we can test this, the BRICS grouping has faced significant stress from bilateral conflicts between members. There have been multiple military standoffs between two members including a 2020 clash that killed over twenty soldiers. Yet multilateral cooperation has continued and conflicts remain somewhat compartmentalized from institutional participation.\n\nThe study is\u00a0[Chaulia (2021)]( published in Global Policy, analyzing BRICS through rational institutionalism theory. It's written from the perspective of one of the smaller member economies examining how institutional design affects strategic dynamics within the grouping.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1pknrhi/why_would_an_economically_dominant_country_accept/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "93 million child brides in East Asia and the Pacific: staggering numbers reveal stalled progress", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.unicef.org/eap/press-releases/93-million-child-brides-east-asia-and-pacific-staggering-numbers-reveal-stalled", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Portugal hit by severe disruption in first general strike for 12 years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxwrvl1734o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland-Slovakia gas interconnector stands largely idle as Bratislava sticks with Russian supplies", "summary": "A natural gas pipeline linking Poland and Slovakia has hardly been used since opening to much fanfare three years ago. Data show that no gas at all has flowed from Poland to Slovakia since March 2024, as Bratislava continues to instead rely on Russian supplies.\n\nAhead of the opening of the\u00a0[\u20ac100 million interconnector]( the EU\u2019s then energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, said that the pipeline represented \u201canother step in helping this region to be fully integrated into the internal EU energy market, diversifying away from Russian gas\u201d.\n\nHowever, it has remained largely idle in the three years since, according to data from the ENTSOG Transparency Platform, an EU gas flow aggregating website.\n\nApart from brief spikes of activity in late 2023 and early 2024, no gas has flowed from Poland to Slovakia. There have been more regular flows in the other direction, but the data show regular periods of many months in which the pipeline is not being used at all.\n\nGas flow (in millions of kilowatt-hours per day) through the interconnector from Poland to Slovakia (top chart) and Slovakia to Poland (bottom chart). Source:\u00a0[ENTSOG Transparency Platform](\n\nInterconnectors allow countries to move gas back and across borders, helping to balance regional supply and demand. Poland has such links with almost all neighbouring countries, with the exception of Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave. The Polish-Slovak link is the only one to remain largely idle.\n\nIn comments to Notes from Poland, the Polish gas transmission operator, Gaz-System, admitted that \u201cthe level of utilisation is low\u201d, saying that flows \u201cdepend on market demand\u201d.\n\nLandlocked Slovakia has negligible domestic gas production and is almost entirely dependent on imported pipeline gas.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it continued to import Russian gas, citing contractual obligations to Gazprom. In 2023, a new government took office led by Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has criticised EU sanctions on Moscow and said that Russian gas remained essential for the Slovak economy.\n\nThe halt of Russian gas transit via Ukraine at the start of this year had raised expectations that the Slovak-Polish interconnector would finally be used, but this did not happen. Russian gas continues to reach Slovakia from Hungary via the TurkStream pipeline.\n\nHowever, EU plans to ban imports of Russian gas after 2027 could eventually force Slovakia\u2019s hand and bring the largely dormant Polish-Slovakian interconnector into operation.\n\n\u201cThis may certainly encourage many market participants to seek alternative sources of gas supplies, including from Poland,\u201d Gaz-System told Notes from Poland. \u201cThe interconnector with Slovakia could become an important element of a regional gas hub.\u201d\n\nThe latter remarks refer to Poland\u2019s ambitions to serve as a hub for gas supplies to neighbouring countries, such as Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nPoland already imports most of its gas via the Baltic Sea: through the\u00a0[Baltic Pipe](\u00a0that brings gas from Norway and through its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in \u015awinoj\u015bcie, which\u00a0[receives shipments](\u00a0from countries such as the United States and Qatar.\n\nConstruction of a second LNG terminal, which will be located in Gda\u0144sk,\u00a0[began earlier this year](\u00a0and Gaz-System is currently in the process of gauging market interest in the region before deciding whether to commission a third terminal, also in Gda\u0144sk.\n\nPoland\u2019s gas market has been booming this year, with a\u00a0[record 189.3 terawatt hours (TWh)](\u00a0traded so far on the Polish Power Exchange, surpassing pre-war levels.
