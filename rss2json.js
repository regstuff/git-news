That\u2019s why they\u2019ve historically struggled to follow negative instructions like \u201cdon\u2019t say X.\u201d They don\u2019t have rule enforcement; they just autocomplete based on what seems likely.\n\nBut with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), things changed. Now, models like GPT-4 have been trained on tons of examples where users say things like \u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d and the model is rewarded for obeying that request. So yes, \u201cDon\u2019t say the sky is a lie\u201d can now be followed, thanks to learned instruction patterns, not logic.\n\nThat said, positive framing (\u201cSpeak plainly\u201d; \u201cBe blunt\u201d; \u201cAvoid metaphor\u201d) still outperforms negation in precision, reliability, and tone control. Why? Because GPT generates forward: it doesn\u2019t know how to \u201cavoid\u201d as well as it knows how to \u201cproduce.\u201d\n\nSo the best prompt strategy today?\n\nUse positive instruction for control.\nUse negation sparingly and only when the phrasing is unambiguous.\n\nAppreciate you surfacing this, it\u2019s a subtle but critical part of prompt design.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kg1fsn/which_is_more_effective_dont_do_x_vs_please_do_y/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adhadhu - There is nothing to worry about in the military agreements of the former government: Muizzu", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.adhadhu.com/article/67904", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Meeting Audio Recording &amp; Import", "summary": "Hi Reddit.\n\nBeen reading the release notes for 0.6.6 and wondered about this new feature - which Is most welcome!!\n\n\ud83d\udd0a Meeting Audio Recording &amp; ImportSeamlessly record audio from your meetings or capture screen audio and attach it to your notes\u2014making it easier to revisit, annotate, and extract insights from important discussions.\n\nMy question - how do I \"use\" this?
