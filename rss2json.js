At the very end, Charles is the only other character to sink last with Jack and Rose, all after emptying his bottle in one gulp. One last one for \u201cthe road\u201d, as they say.\n\nAt the time of the wreck, Charles must have been 34 years old. He was a habitu\u00e9 of the bottle, known for his love of alcohol. By the time the alarm sounded, the pastry chef already had a glass in his nose. A ringing bell brought him back to reality. Time to evacuate? On the contrary, he\u2019s immediately sent to the bakery to prepare bread. Yes, yes, as the Titanic begins its inexorable descent into the depths of the Atlantic, Charles races like mad to make the life-saving buns.\n\nOnce his mission was accomplished, Charles made his way to the bridge, where the evacuation took place in total chaos. The lifeboats were loaded in disarray, the men were impatient, access to third class was denied, and some refused to believe that the ship was going to sink: they simply didn\u2019t want to board the lifeboats.\n\nCharles, who had been promised a place, begins to lose patience.

Charles found himself trapped on the ship, alone with his bottle. Resigned, he climbs to the top floor and starts throwing chairs overboard, objects that will help some of the survivors to stay alive.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, our heroic pastry chef survived the cataclysm! An hour and 40 minutes after the ship sank, the first lifeboat approached the last point of contact with the Titanic, now swallowed by the ocean. Charles is found asleep on a piece of wreckage.

Agriculture, building, and transit have called for filling in wetlands, and more wetland was filled incidently from all this novel soil experience. \n\nThroughout all of this, stone was being removed from fields, hauled out of forests, chipped off eratics to be piled up in lines, shore up bridges, canals, roads and railbeds, and buried in foundations. The visible stone we see in construction is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nEventually, this stone was being freshly quarried from the earth, but I presume it was initially just foraged and then scavenged, especially before rail was involved. \n\nDo we have any examples of known works (in New England or elsewhere) in stone being harvested? I only know of the *New England Stonehenge*, a heavily compromised site with dubious history. \n\nI have read anecdotally of petroglyphs being harvested, and know that they are often targets of vandalism today. I can only imagine it was the same or possibly worse in the past, especially in time of conflict. \n\nSurely we have lost some artifacts to this phenomenon, but at what scale?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1iquwd1/i_imagine_we_have_lost_works_in_stone_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Arrests of top commanders in Ukraine underscore political power games, army commanders and experts say", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/arrests-of-top-commanders-in-ukraine-underscore-political-power-games-army-commanders-and-experts-say/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Carolina senator introduces bill to ban smoking in cars with children under 12", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews4.com/news/local/south-carolina-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-smoking-in-cars-with-children-under-12-darrell-jackson-democrat-richland-south-carolina-wciv-abc-news-4-02-13-2025", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Seeking Advice on Training a Model for Multi-Task Text Generation (Translation + Writing Assistance)", "summary": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m looking to train a model that can handle multiple text-generation tasks, specifically:\n\n* **Translation (English \u21c4 Nepali)**\n* **Writing Assistance** (e.g., drafting letters, rewriting text in a specific style, etc.)\n\nI have experience fine-tuning using **LoRA**, but I\u2019d love to explore other approaches.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n1. **Dataset Structure** \u2013 How should I structure my dataset so the model learns multiple tasks effectively?
