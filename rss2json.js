It was Oct. 11, the first Saturday of the harvest, traditionally a high point of the year.\n\nThe day before, his family had been driven from another grove by extremist settlers who attacked them, witnesses said, in what has become a common occurrence in the West Bank. So on Saturday, they chose what seemed a safer spot. No settlers were in sight. Ayssam, 13, told his mother to rest in the shade, that \u201che\u2019d take care of everything.\u201d\n\nIsraeli soldiers soon emerged from an army vehicle a few hundred yards away and began firing tear gas, witnesses said. Caught in a cloud of gas from three canisters, and unable to breathe, Ayssam collapsed.\n\nAfter four weeks in a coma, Ayssam died on Tuesday. He became the first fatality in what has been a particularly violent olive harvest. Palestinians and activists \u2014 Palestinian, Israeli and Western \u2014 say bands of masked settlers have routinely assailed Palestinian villagers, activists lending their support and journalists there to bear witness. The attackers, they say, are emboldened by permissive law enforcement and by troops who seldom intervene to stop Jewish extremists.\n\nThe olive harvest has been central to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians for generations. A good crop can keep a family afloat financially for a year, and bringing it in once meant picnics, togetherness and cookouts among the trees.\n\nThe Israeli military insists that its soldiers are under orders to allow the harvest, but activists say that the military often sides with the settlers or even tries to disrupt the harvest itself.

During the hour-and-a-half programme, she declared that there are no \u201cpeaceful residents\u201d in Gaza, Israel has the right to \u201ccleanse Gaza and turn it into a parking lot\u201d, and that Palestinians need to be \u201cdissolved in hydrochloric acid\u201d.\n\n&gt;This incident is not an aberration. Many in the Russian liberal opposition, which now operates mostly in exile, unquestioningly support Israel. This is not only due to their tendency to disregard institutionalised racism in Russia but also due to their embrace of a civilisational hierarchy narrative that places the white West at the top. Anti-Palestinian bias is a natural outcome of this worldview.\n\n&gt;Examples of the Russian opposition\u2019s virulent anti-Palestinianism abound. Yuliya Latynina, a star columnist living in exile, has\u00a0made parallels\u00a0between \u201cbarbarians\u201d destroying \u201cblossoming civilisations\u201d and the Palestinians\u00a0and called students protesting against the genocide in Gaza \u201clazy and stupid\u201d.\n\n&gt;Another\u00a0self-exiled\u00a0liberal commentator,\u00a0Leonid Gozman,\u00a0has claimed that European countries that voted at the United Nations in favour of a \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d resolution calling for a truce in Gaza did so because they were \u201cafraid of their immigrant communities\u201d.\n\n&gt;Andrei Pivovarov, former director of Open Russia, a now-defunct pro-democracy organisation, has said he finds Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza \u201cjustified\u201d. He was imprisoned in Russia until he was released last year in a prisoner exchange with the West.\n\n&gt;Russian opposition politician, Dmitri Gudkov, currently residing in Bulgaria, has declared: \u201cFor me, Israel is the embodiment of civilisation. Anything against it is barbarism.\u201d\n\n&gt;Kseniya Larina, a renowned Russian journalist and radio host, also currently in exile, has hosted on her show Israeli Russian-speaking intellectuals multiple times. In one instance, a talk with an Israeli educator was titled, \u201cRecognition of Palestine is not antisemitism, it\u2019s idiocy\u201d.\n\n&gt;These are just a few examples of the many Russian liberal emigres who openly supported Israel\u2019s genocidal war on Gaza. In addition, Russian pop icons, comedians, musicians, and TV personalities who are based in Israel or visit also constantly broadcast the Israeli narrative.\n\n&gt;The paradox here is that the Russian liberal opposition maintains that it is the democratic, moral alternative to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s authoritarianism while openly expressing racist views against the Palestinians. It largely condemns Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Russian war crimes, but denies the Israeli ones.\n\n&gt;In the West, the self-declared democratic values of the Russian opposition are rarely scrutinised.

It is the second time that the court has issued a judgment against Poland relating to its near-total abortion ban.\n\nThe ECHR found that the woman\u2019s right to private and family life was violated by the legal uncertainty created by the delay between the Polish Constitutional Tribunal (TK) ruling of October 2020, which banned abortion in cases of birth defects, and its implementation by the government over three months later.\n\n\n\nThe woman, who is named only by the initials A.R., is a Polish national who lives in the city of Krak\u00f3w. She was 15 weeks pregnant when, on 22 October 2020, the TK issued its ruling that abortion in cases where the foetus has serious and irreversible birth defects is unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, TK judgments only go into force once they are published by the government in the official Journal of Laws. The\u00a0[deadline for that to happen](\u00a0was 2 November 2020, but the government only finally\u00a0[published the ruling](\u00a0on 27 January 2021.\n\nIn the meantime, on 5 November 2020, A.R. had received the results of medical tests that confirmed her foetus suffered from a genetic disorder. Because of uncertainty about when the TK\u2019s ruling would go into force, she travelled to the Netherlands to have her pregnancy terminated at a private clinic.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn 11 January 2021, A.R. submitted a complaint to the ECHR using a pre-filled application form published by the Federation for Women and Family Planning (Federa), which was encouraging women in Poland to lodge cases against the abortion ruling.\n\nShe claimed that the restrictions introduced by the TK had caused her serious and real emotional suffering, thereby violating her rights under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment. However, the ECHR rejected that element of the complaint.\n\nA.R. also argued that her right to respect for private and family life under article 8 of the convention had also been violated. Here, the court agreed, awarding her a total of almost \u20ac16,500 in damages.\n\n\n\nIn its justification, the ECHR noted that the TK\u2019s ruling \u201ccould have been published at any time\u201d and that \u201cin general \\[TK\\] judgments are published immediately.\n\nHowever, the fact that it was so delayed created \u201ca great feeling of uncertainty, aggravated both by the absence of any transitional measures and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt remained unclear whether the restrictions on abortion on the grounds of foetal abnormalities had already taken effect or if abortion could still be legally performed,\u201d wrote the court, and this \u201cconstituted an \u2018interference\u2019 with the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights\u201d.\n\n\n\nIt also noted that three of the TK judges involved in issuing the abortion ruling were illegitimately appointed under Poland\u2019s former Law and Justice (PiS) government and PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda.\n\nThat was a primary factor in the ECHR\u00a0[issuing its first ruling against Poland\u2019s near-total abortion ban](\u00a0in December 2023 and, in today\u2019s judgement, the court said that \u201cthose findings were also relevant in this applicant\u2019s case\u201d.\n\nThe TK\u2019s abortion ruling triggered the largest protests Poland has seen since the fall of communism.

The project, due to be completed by the end of 2027, aims to improve cross-border transport and ease one of the main bottlenecks between the two neighbouring countries.\n\nWhereas most railways in Europe used the standard gauge of 1,435 mm, former Soviet states such as Ukraine use a broad gauge of 1,520 mm. That necessitates changing trains at the border, a time-consuming process.\n\nNow, a new standard-gauge line is planned to run for 80 kilometres from Sknyliv near the Ukrainian city of Lviv to Mostyska II on the Polish border.\n\nThe project is set to cost around \u20ac190 million in total, and the European Commission has now agreed to provide \u20ac73.5 million in non-repayable funding under the EU\u2019s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis project is not only about infrastructure \u2013 it is about Europe\u2019s unity and security,\u201d Oleksiy Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, said at a ceremony to sign the grant agreement with the EU last week.\n\n\u201cEvery euro invested in Ukraine\u2019s transport system is an investment in stability, recovery and the protection of the EU\u2019s external borders,\u201d he added.\n\nIn September, Ukraine opened its first European standard-gauge railway line, also financed via CEF, linking the western town of Chop, near the borders with Slovakia and Hungary, to Uzhhorod, 22 kilometres to the north.\n\nThe new line allows passenger trains from Uzhhorod to travel directly to Budapest, Ko\u0161ice, Vienna and Bratislava.\n\n\n\nAccording to Polish rail industry news service Rynek Kolejowy, the Polish infrastructure ministry expects the new line to have a positive impact on passenger services and trade between Ukraine and the EU, including Poland.\n\n\u201c\\[The project\\] also increases Poland\u2019s importance as a transit country,\u201d Anna Szuma\u0144ska, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson, told the website, adding that, after the end of the war Ukraine, Polish carriers are also expected to be able to run trains on the link.\n\nThe project comes two years after a passenger rail connection between Poland and Ukraine was revived.
