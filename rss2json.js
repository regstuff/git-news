Joint ventures would continue to require a majority state-owned stake.\n\nThe law, if given final approval when lawmakers vote again next week, would maintain a baseline royalty rate of 30 per cent, though it would allow reductions to 20 per cent and 15 per cent in certain cases, \u201cin order to achieve the economic viability\u201d of projects.

In particular, the status of thousands of judges (often referred to as \u201cneo-judges\u201d) appointed after the KRS was reformed by PiS, and the rulings issued by them, has been called into question.\n\nThe current government, which replaced PiS in December 2023, has presented bills to\u00a0[restore the KRS\u2019s legitimacy](\u00a0and\u00a0[invalidate most judicial appointments](\u00a0made after the KRS was overhauled by PiS. However, it has so far failed to implement those plans.\n\nCommenting on the case in Gi\u017cycko, justice minister Waldemar \u017burek said that it underscored the need for urgent reform of the justice system, noting that parliament would this week begin work on the two bills.\n\n\u201cThe case in which a divorce judgment was deemed non-existent\u2026reveals something deeply disturbing,\u201d wrote \u017burek on social media. \u201cThe crisis surrounding neo-judges is now infiltrating the most sensitive areas of citizens\u2019 lives. Into family matters, property issues and the fundamental sense of legal security.\u201d\n\nThe situation has \u201cgenerated chaos in the courts, and led to situations where people do not know whether their judgments even exist\u201d, he added. \u201cThat is why this problem must be resolved\u201d.\n\nHowever, Zbigniew Ziobro, who served as justice minister under the former PiS government, blamed the current administration for the situation, saying that they had \u201cbrought about the real chaos and anarchy\u201d by questioning judicial appointments.\n\nHe also accused them of hypocrisy, noting that they do not question rulings by \u201cneo-judges\u201d when it suits their interests. As an example, he pointed to a 2023 case in which \u017burek won in court against a bank in a judgment issued by a judge appointed after the disputed reforms.\n\nZiobro was recently\u00a0[granted asylum by Hungary]( where he fled rather than face charges in Poland for a variety of alleged crimes committed while he was justice minister. He argues that the case against him is an act of \u201cpolitical revenge\u201d by the current government.\n\nAccording to [Prawo.pl]( judges say the case in Gi\u017cycko is far from the first such instance involving family matters such as divorce.\n\nOne unnamed Supreme Court judge said that there is already a line of jurisprudence in the city of Olsztyn under which family law decisions issued by \u201cneo-judges\u201d are treated as legally non-existent.\n\n\u201cSuch rulings show that there is chaos at many levels in the Polish justice system,\u201d said Katarzyna Wr\u00f3bel-Zumbrzycka, a member of Iustitia, a Polish judges\u2019 association that opposed PiS\u2019s reforms. \u201cIt needs to be cleaned up, first and foremost for the people, so that such situations do not happen again.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/20/polish-court-rejects-couples-divorce-because-it-was-issued-by-illegitimate-judge/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France's Navy intercepts sanctioned oil tanker in the Mediterranean sailing from Russia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/2026/01/22/frances-navy-intercepts-sanctioned-oil-tanker-in-the-mediterranean-sailing-from-russia", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Outrage over Yuvraj Mehta's death in dug-up pit after begging for help for hours", "summary": "The death of a 27-year-old Indian IT professional after his car fell into an unmarked construction pit has raised questions around urban planning and road safety in India.\n\nLast Friday, at around midnight, Yuvraj Mehta was driving home in Noida, a suburb of the capital Delhi, through dense winter fog when his car reportedly hit a low boundary wall and plunged into the deep pit full of water. The site had reportedly been dug up a few years ago before work was stalled.\n\nMehta, who didn't know how to swim, climbed on to the roof of his car as it began to sink and rang his father who rushed to the scene and alerted the emergency services. His father told reporters that Mehta remained there for close to two hours, flashing the torch on his phone and shouting for help.\n\nThen, his cries stopped. By the time authorities recovered his body, almost five hours had passed since the accident, local media reported.\n\nMehta's tragic death has made national headlines, and the fact that it happened so close to the capital city has shocked and angered residents. Protests have been held at the accident site, with demonstrators accusing authorities of negligence and demanding accountability.\n\nHis death has also fuelled larger questions about the state of Indian roads and urban planning.\n\n\"Noida techie's \\[Mehta's\\] death is essentially a murder. Dreams shattered. Hard work gone in vain. Father's hopes buried. All because of a failed system,\" one user wrote on X.\n\n\"This tragedy raises deeper questions about the quality of infrastructure in even big cities like Noida,\" said another.\n\nSome users shared their own experiences of accidents because of bad roads, lack of adequate signage and poor lighting after dark. Some also complained about open drains and construction sites on roads close to their homes becoming death traps, especially for children and the elderly.\n\nSince the accident, police in Noida have registered two cases against the real estate developers of the construction site where the pit was located following a complaint from Mehta's family.\n\nOn Sunday, the government of Uttar Pradesh state, where Noida is located, removed a senior official from the township's governing authority and ordered an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the rescue operation and site safety.\n\nSince then, police have arrested Abhay Kumar, one of the owners of the construction site, for alleged culpable homicide due to negligence under India's criminal code.

However, increasing that to 700 tonnes would, on current figures, move it ahead of the Netherlands (612.5 tonnes) and Turkey (641.3 tonnes).\n\n\u201cThis will place Poland among the elite ten countries with the largest gold reserves in the world,\u201d declared NBP governor Adam Glapi\u0144ski in a press release on Tuesday announcing the plan to increase reserves to 700 tonnes.\n\nPoland has been accelerating its gold accumulation in recent years. In 1996, the NBP held just 14 tonnes of gold. By 2016, the year Glapi\u0144ski became the bank\u2019s governor, that had risen to 102 tonnes. In the decade since then, the figure has grown more than fivefold.\n\nAccording to\u00a0[data](\u00a0from the World Gold Council, an international trade association for the gold industry, in the first 11 months of last year, the NBP added more gold to its reserves (95 tonnes) than any other central bank globally.\n\nIn May last year, NBP\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that for the first time its gold reserves were larger than those of the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nLast week, Glapi\u0144ski had already signalled plans to increase the NBP\u2019s gold reserves. He emphasised that gold is a strategic asset for the state\u2019s security and said that selling it is \u201cabsolutely out of the question\u201d, reported broadcaster TVN24.\n\nGlapi\u0144ski also warned that the rapid rise in gold prices will not last indefinitely and that a significant correction is possible. Regardless, he said, the central bank will continue accumulating reserves to ensure the country\u2019s financial security in \u201cexceptionally volatile times.\u201d\n\nAccording to Glapi\u0144ski, the 550 tonnes of gold currently held by the bank are worth nearly 276 billion zloty (\u20ac65.3 billion). That meant that the metal accounted for around 28% of the value of the NBP\u2019s total reserves at the end of 2025.\n\nLast year, following decades of rapid growth, Poland\u2019s GDP surpassed $1 trillion, thereby overtaking Switzerland to become\u00a0[the 20th largest national economy in the world](", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/20/poland-to-increase-gold-reserve-to-worlds-10th-largest/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Almost one in 10 young Irish adults believe Holocaust is a \u2018myth\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2026/01/21/almost-one-in-10-young-irish-adults-believe-holocaust-is-a-myth/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran Protest Deaths Seen Rising With One Estimate Topping 20,000", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/iran-protest-deaths-seen-rising-with-one-estimate-topping-20-000?leadSource=reddit_wall", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
