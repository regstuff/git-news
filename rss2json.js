Recently, I made an online dictionary with the help of a programmer friend and I've collected over 6000 words that would help our younger generation learn the language. Word entries are all spelled with a romanization system that accurately transcribes how each word is pronounced.\n\nHowever, one thing that's missing is a text-to-speech program so that people can hear what the words sound like. Of course, I could also record my voice saying over 6000 words, but it seems tedious. Having a text-to-speech program for our language would allow people not only to hear what words sound like, but also hear how example sentences are said.\n\nCan anyone help develop this?
