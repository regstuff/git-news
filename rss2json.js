I\u2019m currently a freshman at a university with limited anthropology classes, especially archaeology (I\u2019ve already taken 2/3 archaeology classes). When I started at this school, I wasn\u2019t aware that my interests would shift to archaeology or else I would never have chosen it. Now, I\u2019ve decided that I should transfer somewhere with a better program, the only issue being that most of them are out of state. The cost of out of state tuition is so high that I\u2019m considering staying home and doing community college for a year to save up. Is this a bad idea? Will it look bad in the future when I want to go to grad school and become an archaeologist? I\u2019m really passionate about this field and feel like I\u2019m stuck. Would it be better to stick it out at my current school and go somewhere better for grad school?
