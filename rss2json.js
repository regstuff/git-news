Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in \"input space\", \"concept space\", and \"output space\", respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract \"concept space\" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cuzkpl/do_llamas_work_in_english_on_the_latent_language/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What\u2019s Stopping India\u2019s Semiconductor Mission?", "summary": "[\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, the article talks about the lack of collaboration between the education system and academia, although issues with infrastructure (such as maintaining the massive amounts of energy needed) and spending on education and research (which is abominably low) are brought up.

It's been a while since I read the manifestos of both the BJP and Congress, but I do not recall seeing anything on education outside of reservations.
