We import almost 90-95% of our chips. And we want to build a full semiconductor ecosystem by 2030 with just $10 billion in incentives?\n\nWe don't have the talent. We need to partner with some industry leader like TSMC, who just declined to set up a plant in India. They spent $17 Bn on just ONE factory in Taiwan. Their new investment in Arizona is going to be $165 Bn. How can India catch up?\n\nTo be self-sufficient in chips, you need:\n\n1. High purity wafers\n2. Chip design\n3. EUV lithography machines\n4. Device design + software\n5. Packaging and testing\n6. Apps\n\nIndia is weak on every front. Except the packaging and testing layer, India doesn't have any original patents or advantage. 20% of design engineers in the world are of Indian origin, but the blueprints and profits stay abroad. EUV machines that print circuits on chips are controlled by ASML in the Netherlands. We don't have any device companies like Apple, and we haven't designed any global apps like WhatsApp.\n\nSo far this wasn't a problem because a big chunk of India's economy was cheap coding for American companies. With AI automating coding, a big part of this will shut down and grads will struggle to find jobs. Whoever holds the chips will hold the cards, and we'll have to pay any price that other countries quote \u2013 chips will be the new oil, and India is totally out of the supply chain.\n\nThe government is trying, but it's just not enough.\n\n* Zoho was looking to invest $700 Mn in a semiconductor plan and then backed out.\n* China has spent a trillion dollars over 20 years and they're still importing GPUs from the US. Korea and Japan have been building chips and devices for decades. None of them are self-sufficient.\n* Taiwan is at the top only because of heavy investment in US dollars and US talent (Morris Chang who founded TSMC was one of the key members at Texas Instruments).\n\nHow does India even\u00a0*hope*\u00a0to compete within the next 5-10 years? If AI automates us out of this race, a lot of the outsourcing will stop, and unemployment will spike. It's also going to be a security issue because weapons and surveillance depend on chips and AI, and we'll depend on other countries for these.\n\nI'm really worried about this. I don't know if the solution is to throw more money at it, attract key players from other countries by giving more equity, or to double down on some very critical part of the supply chain. What do y'all think?\n\nSources:\n\n1. **India\u2019s $10B semiconductor plan:**\u00a0[\n2. **TSMC\u2019s Arizona fab costing $12\u2013$40B**:\u00a0[\n3. **ASML is the only EUV lithography supplier:**\u00a0[\n4. **Zoho backing out of semiconductor fab:**\u00a0[\n5. **China\u2019s struggle with chip self-sufficiency:**\u00a0[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1kud5cb/indias_2030_plan_will_stumble_without_a_full/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indian troops shoot dead Pakistani man crossing frontier, officials say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/india-border-security-force-troops-shoot-pakistani-man-frontier-border-gujarat", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Global OEMs source over $2 bn worth aerospace components, services annually from India", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/global-oems-source-over-2-bn-worth-aerospace-components-services-annually-from-india-official/articleshow/121367448.cms?from=mdr", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli strike kills nine of Gaza doctor's children, hospital says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0eq9lq7xr1o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yunus\u2019 Anti-India Posturing At Behest of Foreign Powers?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/columnists/wasbir-hussain-yunus-anti-india-posturing-at-behest-of-foreign-powers-1880917", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yunus counter: Northeast key to India's growth, says PM Modi", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muhammad-yunus-counter-northeast-key-to-indias-growth-says-pm-modi-bangladesh/articleshow/121369595.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dutch chipmaker NXP eyes new unit in Greater Noida under $1 billion expansion plan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/dutch-chipmaker-nxp-eyes-new-unit-in-greater-noida-under-1-billion-expansion-plan-13042966.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Warhammer 40,000 Maker Games Workshop Is Doing So Well It\u2019s Giving $27 Million to Its Staff", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-maker-games-workshop-is-doing-so-well-its-giving-27-million-to-its-staff", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thailand, India join forces to strengthen medicine and vaccine security", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nationthailand.com/news/world/40050312", "author": "None"}, {"title": "American venture capital is flowing into India like never before.", "summary": "", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-venture-capital-flowing-india-090000490.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India pushes for removal of export controls among BRICS nations", "summary": "", "link": "https://ddnews.gov.in/en/india-pushes-for-removal-of-export-controls-among-brics-nations/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The medieval town that vanished in a single day", "summary": "", "link": "https://tempodeconhecer.blogs.sapo.pt/the-medieval-town-that-vanished-in-a-77195", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why Making an iPhone in the U.S. Would Be So Difficult", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/technology/apple-iphone-trump-india-china.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why fierce rivals India, Pakistan and China are racing to woo the Taliban", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/south-asia/taliban-afghanistan-india-pakistan-china-b2756025.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli airstrikes hit south Lebanon before region\u2019s first elections in years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/23/israeli-airstrikes-south-lebanon-elections-hezbollah", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How can I add data to the model?", "summary": "I would like to add persistent learning data to the AI.
