Here\u2019s an example:\n\n&gt;user\\_inputs = \\[\n\n&gt;{\"comment\\_text\": \"I love this product, it's everything I wanted!\"},\n\n&gt;{\"comment\\_text\": \"Not impressed... wouldn't consider buying this.\"},\n\n&gt;\\# ...\n\n&gt;\\]\n\n**Run in 3 Lines of Code - Concurrency built-in up to 1000 calls/min**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve defined or learned a skill (similar to creating a specialized transformer in a standard ML pipeline), you can load it and apply it to your data in just a few lines:\n\n&gt;\\# Suppose we previously saved a learned skill to \"evaluate\\_buy\\_comments\\_skill.json\".  \nwith open(\"evaluate\\_buy\\_comments\\_skill.json\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as file:   \ndefinition= json.load(file)\n\n&gt;skill = GeneralSkill.load\\_skill(definition)\n\n&gt;tasks = skill.create\\_tasks(user\\_inputs)\n\n&gt;results = skill.run\\_tasks\\_in\\_parallel(tasks)\n\n&gt;print(results)\n\n**Get Structured Results**\n\nThe library returns structured outputs for each of your records. The keys in the results dictionary map to the indexes of your original list. For example:\n\n&gt;{\n\n&gt;\"0\": {\n\n&gt;\"likely\\_to\\_buy\": 90,\n\n&gt;\"reason\": \"Comment shows strong enthusiasm and positive sentiment.\"\n\n&gt;},\n\n&gt;\"1\": {\n\n&gt;\"likely\\_to\\_buy\": 25,\n\n&gt;\"reason\": \"Expressed disappointment and reluctance to purchase.\"\n\n&gt;}\n\n&gt;}\n\n**Pass on to the Next Steps**\n\nEach record\u2019s output can then be used in downstream tasks. For instance, you might:\n\n1. Store the results in a database\n2. Filter for high-likelihood leads\n3. .....\n\nBelow is a small example showing how you might parse the dictionary and feed it into a separate function:\n\n&gt;\\# Suppose 'flash\\_results' is the dictionary with structured LLM outputs\n\n&gt;for idx, result in flash\\_results.items():\n\n&gt;desired\\_score = result\\[\"likely\\_to\\_buy\"\\]\n\n&gt;reason\\_text = result\\[\"reason\"\\]\n\n&gt;\\# Now do something with the score and reason, e.g., store in DB or pass to next step\n\n&gt;print(f\"Comment #{idx} =&gt; Score: {desired\\_score}, Reason: {reason\\_text}\")\n\n**Comparison**  \nFlashlearn is a lightweight library for people who do not need high complexity flows of LangChain.\n\n1. **FlashLearn -** Minimal library meant for well defined us cases that expect structured outputs\n2. **LangChain -** For building complex thinking multi-step agents with memory and reasoning\n\nIf you like it, give us a star: [Github link](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1iju8a2/use_llms_like_scikitlearn/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open Source Readable Regex REST API - Seeking Dev Help", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/drewg2009/readableRegex", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cocaine is \u2018no worse than whisky,\u2019 Colombian president says | CNN", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/07/americas/cocaine-whiskey-colombian-president-intl-hnk/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UMass will pay student who made half-court $10,000 after insurance company said his foot was on line", "summary": "", "link": "https://lite.aol.com/news/story/0001/20250207/c5deb4c8aa9e1be5a04a8f16cf288121.htm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "2,000-Year-Old Chariot Parts Discovered Beneath Welsh Airfield", "summary": "", "link": "https://gizmodo.com/2000-year-old-chariot-parts-discovered-beneath-welsh-airfield-2000560745", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh asks India to stop ousted PM Hasina making 'false statements'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-asks-india-stop-former-pm-hasina-making-false-statements-2025-02-07/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What tools exist for rapidly comparing speech to text tools", "summary": "Hundreds of people must embark on speech to their evaluations and comparisons every day.
