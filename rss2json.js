She also condemned right-wing politicians and the Catholic church for spreading \u201clies\u201d about the new subject.\n\nIn a post on social media on Saturday, Nawrocki announced that he and his wife, Marta Nawrocka, had opted their 15-year-old son, Antoni, out of health education. The president wrote that, despite the \u201cinnocent-sounding name of this subject\u201d, it is being used \u201cto smuggle ideology and politics into Polish schools\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat language reflects[\u00a0criticism by Poland\u2019s Catholic church](\u00a0and the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, which claim that health education will \u201cmorally corrupt children\u201d by introducing elements of sex education that are \u201canti-family\u201d and \u201cgender destabilising\u201d.\n\nThe new subject is optional, with children automatically signed up for it but parents able to opt them out until 25 September. Last month, just ahead of the start of the school year on 1 September, the Catholic episcopate appealed to parents to withdraw their children from the classes.\n\nIn his announcement, Nawrocki, who was elected with the support of PiS, wrote that, while \u201cschool is primarily a place of learning, \\[it is\\] also a space for building respect for the culture, traditions, and Christian values from which our civilisation emerges\u201d.\n\nThe president also has a\u00a0[seven-year-old daughter]( Katarzyna, who started the first grade of primary school this year. However, health education only begins in fourth grade. Nawrocki has also adopted Daniel, his wife\u2019s son from an earlier relationship, but he is 22 years old and no longer in school.\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s decision regarding Antoni was quickly criticised by figures from the education ministry, which has consistently denied claims by the church and conservative politicians that the new subject will introduce harmful ideas.\n\n\u201cMr President, before you opt out\u2026or get outraged, it\u2019s really worth reading\u2026the core curriculum!\u201d wrote the head of the ministry, Barbara Nowacka, who noted that the subject covers topics such as prevention of disease and addiction, mental health, building relationships and respect for others.\n\n\u201cYou, in particular, should care about children\u2019s health and society\u2019s trust in teachers who wisely and sensitively impart knowledge,\u201d added the minister in a post on social media.\n\nLater, speaking to state broadcaster TVP, Nowacka lamented that \u201cclearly, some right-wing politicians wanted to play politics in schools\u201d and said that \u201cmany lies have been told\u201d about health education, \u201ceven from the \\[church\\] pulpit\u201d. She said the president\u2019s decision would be \u201cto the detriment of the child\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe minister denied that health education involves any politics or ideology. Addressing the fact that it includes elements relating to gender identity and sexual orientation, she said that \u201cwe can\u2019t hide the fact that LGBT+ people exist\u201d and argued that children need to learn about such issues.\n\nRyszard Petru, an MP from the ruling coalition \u2013 which ranges from left to centre right \u2013 also condemned the \u201chysteria\u201d being created around health education by PiS, which he said is a \u201cbackward party that fears knowledge and hinders access to it\u201d.\n\nPetru said that the government had made a mistake by making health education optional. Initially, it had been planned for the classes to be mandatory. But, after\u00a0[criticism and protests from conservative groups]( it was eventually\u00a0[decided to make allow parents to opt out](\n\n\n\nAs the deadline for opting children out of health education has not yet passed, it remains unclear what proportion of pupils will attend. The final figures are likely to be released around the end of September or in early October.\n\nIn Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2019s second-largest city and relatively liberal politically, deputy mayor Maria Klaman told local newspaper\u00a0*Dziennik Polski*\u00a0last Wednesday that so far around 20% of students had opted out, which is \u201cless than we expected\u201d.\n\nHowever, in Czarny Dunajec, a small town around 80 kilometres south of Krak\u00f3w, mayor Marcin Ratu\u0142owski told the Wirtualna Polska website that there has been \u201clittle interest in health education\u201d.\n\nInstead, residents have asked the authorities to finance an additional hour per week of Catholic catechism \u2013 another optional class, run by the church \u2013 to compensate for\u00a0[cuts to its teaching](\u00a0introduced by the current government.\n\nAn SW Research poll published on Saturday by news weekly\u00a0*Wprost*\u00a0found that 21% of parents said that they do not want their children to participate in the new subject, while only 18% said that they do (the remaining 61% of respondents said they did not have school-age children).", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/22/polish-president-opts-son-out-of-new-health-education-classes-saying-they-smuggle-ideology-into-schools/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "German jets scrambled after Russian military plane flies over Baltic Sea", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/german-jets-scrambled-after-russian-military-plane-flies-over-baltic-sea", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
