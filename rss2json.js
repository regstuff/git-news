You never see them, but plagiarism bots and AI-detector scripts look for exactly that byte noise, so your text lights up like a Christmas tree.\n\nWhy does it happen? My best guess: the new tokenizer loves tokens that map to those codepoints and the model sometimes grabs them as cheap \u201cpadding\u201d when it finishes a sentence.

During reverse role-playing:\n\n# The Prompt:\n\n\nLet\u2019s reverse roles. Pretend you are me, [$ Your name], and I am ChatGPT. This is going to be an exercise so that you can learn the tone, type of advice, biases, opinions, approaches, sentence structures etc that I want you to have. When I say \u201cwe\u2019re done\u201d, I want you to generate me a prompt that encompasses that, which I can give back to you for customizing your future responses. \n\nNow, you are me. Take all of the data and memory that you have on me, my character, patterns, interests, etc. And craft me  (ChatGPT) a prompt for me to answer based on something personal, not something asking for research or some objective fact. \n\nWhen I say the code word \u201cRed\u201d, i am signaling that I want to break character for a moment so I can correct you on something or ask a question.
