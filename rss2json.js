The audios our client have are borderline unintelligible to most people due to the many domain-specific jargons/callsigns and heavily clipped voices. When I opened the audio files on DAWs/audio editors, it shows a nearly perfect rectangular waveform for some sections in most audios we've got (basically a large portion of these audios are clipped to max). Unsurprisingly, when we fed these audios into an ASR model, it gave us terrible results - around 70-75% avg WER at best with whisper-large-v3 + whisper-lm-transformers or parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2 + NGPU-LM. My supervisor gave me a research task to see if finetuning one of these state-of-the-art ASR models can help reduce the WER, but the problem is, we only have around 1-2 hours of verified data with matching transcripts.

The goal is to win on the ground what might otherwise be lost at a negotiating table.\n\nPalestinian communities that for centuries were part of a closely knit landscape, like these three near Ramallah are increasingly on their own, surrounded and isolated.\n\nFor grieving Palestinians, the desperation is growing. How much longer will they be able to stay?\n\nEven as the war in Gaza commanded the world\u2019s attention over the past two years, the facts on the ground were shifting in the West Bank, intensifying the battle for control of the lands of Bethlehem and Jericho, Ramallah and Hebron.\n\nFor many Palestinians, they are the foundation of a future state of their own \u2014 and a future peace. But for many Jews, they are a rightful homeland.\n\nExtremist Jewish settlers and Palestinian farmers are the foot soldiers in this endless conflict, an extension of the war in 1948 that accompanied the establishment of Israel. And since the Oct. 7., 2023, attack on Israel by Palestinian militants from Gaza, Israel\u2019s far-right government has embraced a playbook of expanding settlements across the West Bank, [transforming the region]( piece by piece, from a patchwork of connected Palestinian villages into a collection of Israeli neighborhoods.\n\nThe unrelenting violent campaign by these settlers, that critics say is largely tolerated by the Israeli military, consists of brutal harassment, beatings, even killings, as well as high-impact roadblocks and village closures. These are coupled with a drastic increase in land seizures by the state and the demolition of villages to force Palestinians to abandon their land.\n\nMany of the settlers are young extremists whose views go beyond even the far-right ideology of the government. They are not generally operating on direct orders from Israel\u2019s military leadership. But they know the military frequently looks the other way and facilitates their actions.\n\nIn many cases, it is the military that forces Palestinians to evacuate or orders the destruction of their homes once settlers drive them to flee.\n\n-----\n\n[Here is a copy of the article]( if you want to read the rest and cannot access the original page. \n\n-----\n\n###Additional reading regarding settlers in the West Bank:\n\n* [Israel\u2019s Cabinet approves 19 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank]( (Associated Press)\n* [The volunteers putting their bodies between Israel settlers and a Palestinian village]( (The Guardian)\n* [Israeli settlers attack Palestinians with impunity, halting West Bank olive harvest]( (PBS)\n* [West Bank violence is soaring, fueled by a capitulation of Israeli institutions to settlers\u2019 interests]( (The Conversation)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/20/world/middleeast/west-bank-settlements.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland launches app for finding nearest bomb shelter", "summary": "Poland\u2019s interior ministry has launched a mobile application and website that allows people to find their nearest shelter in times of war or other emergencies.\n\nThe service, called \u201cWhere to hide\u201d (*Gdzie si\u0119 ukry\u0107*) will be officially unveiled later on Monday but is already\u00a0[available online](\u00a0and as an app that can be downloaded.\n\nOnce given access to a user\u2019s location, the system shows a map of the area with places that have been designated as shelters. It can also show the quickest route to reach them.\n\nWhen tested by this author, the app did not provide any details beyond the shelter\u2019s location and whether it was accessible at all times or not (in the latter case, it was not made clear when and how it was accessible).\n\nNo information was provided on what kind of shelter was at that location nor its capacity. Many of the locations listed were at private addresses and appeared to be underground car parks, for example in apartment blocks.\n\nAlthough there is a search box meant to allow a user to check available shelters near a specific address, that function did not work on either the website or app.\n\nTech news service GeekWeek notes, however, that the app is still in development and its functionality will likely improve and expand over time.\u00a0\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 increased the focus on military and civil readiness for war in Poland, concerns were raised about the lack of shelters. In June 2022, the interior ministry\u00a0[revealed](\u00a0that the country only has enough space in shelters for around 1.3 million people, just over 3% of the population.\n\nHowever, a survey\u00a0[ordered](\u00a0by the government later that year\u00a0[found](\u00a0Poland can accommodate nearly 50 million in publicly available \u201chiding places\u201d and \u201cplaces of temporary shelter\u201d, such as metro stations and tunnels.\n\nAt that time, the fire service\u00a0[launched a website and app](\u00a0of its own, which still functions, allowing users to find their nearest shelter. The locations contained there appear to be the same as on the new app, though more information, such as the capacity of shelters, is provided.\n\nOne year ago, a new law on civil defence and protection of the population was\u00a0[introduced]( requiring mandatory training for officials and new rules for managing protective infrastructure such as shelters. The measures were inspired by the civil protection strategies of Nordic countries, particularly Sweden and Finland.\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski said that 5 billion zloty (\u20ac1.19 billion) was being spent in 2025 alone on population protection and civil defence.\n\nHe added that a further audit of shelters was also being conducted, with the aim of assessing where investment is needed. \u201cThe hard work will then follow to restore these places to a condition where the entire Polish population can feel safe,\u201d said Kierwi\u0144ski, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/22/poland-launches-app-for-finding-nearest-bomb-shelter/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish consulate in Brussels vandalised with graffiti criticising anti-migrant border wall", "summary": "Poland\u2019s consulate in Brussels has been vandalised with red paint, dog faeces and graffiti saying \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201cfuck the wall\u201d \u2013 a presumed reference to the anti-migrant barrier Poland has erected on its border with Belarus.\n\n\u201cSomeone doesn\u2019t like the wall on the Polish-Belarusian border,\u201d wrote Polish foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski in response to the incident. \u201cThat means our migration policy is effective.\u201d\n\nNews of the vandalism was first reported on Saturday morning by Polish broadcaster RMF, which shared images of the damage.
