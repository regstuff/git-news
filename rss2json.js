However, I've noticed that many systems struggle with Japanese and Mandarin, and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this.\n\n- For example, the Chinese word \u8c1a\u8bed is often pronounced as \"gengo\" (the Japanese reading) instead of \"y\u00e0ny\u01d4\" because the same word exists in both languages. If we only see the word \u8afa\u8a9e, it's impossible to know if it's Chinese or Japanese.\n\n- Another issue is with characters that have multiple pronunciations, like \u5f97, which can be read as \"d\u011bi\" or \"de\" depending on the context.\n\n- Sometimes, the pronunciation is incorrect for no apparent reason. For instance, in \u8ddd\u79bb, the last syllable should be \"li,\" but it\u2019s sometimes pronounced as \"zhi.\" (Had this issue using ElevenLabs with certain speakers)\n\nDespite English having one of the most inconsistent orthographies, these kinds of errors seem less frequent, likely due to the use of letters. However, it seems to me that a lot of companies train on raw data, without using a grapheme-to-phoneme model. Maybe the hope is that with more data, the model will learn the correct pronunciations. But I am not sure that this really works.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1f9v94y/is_it_even_a_good_idea_to_get_rid_of/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India signs chip deal with Singapore during Modi visit", "summary": "", "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/India-signs-chip-deal-with-Singapore-during-Modi-visit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "IC 814 hijack was a victory for Masood Azhar\u2014and the moment of his strategic downfall", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/opinion/security-code/ic-814-hijack-was-a-victory-for-masood-azhar-and-the-moment-of-his-strategic-downfall/2253834/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "XiangShan - an open-source high-performance RISC-V processor project", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli Military Returns Body of 58-Year-Old Palestinian Man with Signs of Torture and Abuse", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.democracynow.org/2024/9/3/headlines/israeli_military_returns_body_of_58_year_old_palestinian_man_with_signs_of_torture_and_abuse", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Guidance for NLP ", "summary": "Hello guys, i want to share with you guys a few activities i have done this year and i want to know what should i do next.   \nthe thing is, i love NLP, i have started studying nlp and deep learning and machine learning specializations.   \ni have finished both specializations in coursera, started reading bunch of papers related to nlp, done some projects but still i have this feeling that i still dont know the deep understanding of NLP, the detailed calculations behind the neural networks and stuff like this.   \ni want to know what should i do now  ?   \nis the NLP specialization by [deeplearning.ai]( a good idea ?   \nany books to recommend ?   \ni have gathered a bunch of books but i dont know which one to start:   \n\"Speech and Language Processing\" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H.
