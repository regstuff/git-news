This event is designed to encourage innovation and collaboration in the Information Extraction field, focusing on software mentions in scholarly articles.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Task Overview:**\n\nSoftware plays an essential role in scientific research and is considered one of the crucial entity types in scholarly documents. However, the software is usually not cited formally in academic documents, resulting in various informal software mentions. Automatic identification and disambiguation of software mentions, related attributes, and the purpose of software mentions contributes to the better understanding, accessibility, and reproducibility of research but is a challenging task.\n\nThis competition invites participants to develop a system that detects software mentions and their attributes as named entities from scholarly texts and classifies the relationships between these entity pairs. The dataset includes sentences from full-text scholarly documents annotated with Named Entities and Relations.\n\n\n\n**Participation Details:**\n\nTo participate, please register using this link \\[[\n\nAll necessary materials, including detailed task guidelines and data, will be provided upon registration.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Competition Timeline Overview**\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Competition Registration starts on February 24, 2025\n* First phase: Training and Test Dataset release: February 28, 2025\n* The first phase ends on: March 18, 2025\n* Second phase data release: March 18, 2025\n* The competition ends on: April 3, 2025\n* Paper submission deadline: April 17, 2025\n* Notification of Acceptance: May 1, 2025\n* Camera-ready Paper Deadline for Workshop: May 16, 2025.\n* Workshop Date: July 21-August 1, 2025\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuccessful entries will be featured in the Proceedings of the Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing ([SDP](\n\nFor more detailed information about the task, including participation guidelines and data access, please visit our competition in [codabench]( or our [website](\n\nLooking forward to your participation.\n\n  \ncheers!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1iylxay/join_our_somd_2025sdp_a_joint_ner_and_re/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sam Pitroda is all that the Chinese are talking about", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/opinion/eye-on-china/sam-pitroda-all-that-chinese-talking-about-and-chinks-in-indias-policy/2511354/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A New Roadmap for Australia's Economic Engagement with India", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iyh8qo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PM Narendra Modi to visit Russia for 80th Victory Day Parade: Report", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.wionews.com/world/pm-narendra-modi-scheduled-to-visit-moscow-for-80th-victory-day-parade-report-8757458", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Have You Used Model Distillation to Optimize LLMs?", "summary": "Deploying LLMs at scale is expensive and slow, but what if you could compress them into smaller, more efficient models without losing performance?  \n  \nA lot of teams are experimenting with SLM distillation as a way to:  \n\n* Reduce inference costs  \n* Improve response speed  \n* Maintain high accuracy with fewer compute resources\n\nBut distillation isn\u2019t always straightforward.
