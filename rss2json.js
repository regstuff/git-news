This isn't just theory\u2014this is what\u2019s working for me in real-world usage.\n\n1. Be super literal. GPT-4.1 follows directions more strictly than older versions. If you want something specific, say it explicitly.\n\n\n2. Bookend your prompts. For long contexts, put your most important instructions at both the beginning and end of your prompt.\n\n\n3. Use structure and formatting. Markdown headers, XML-style tags, or triple backticks () help GPT understand the structure. JSON is not ideal for large document sets.\n\n\n4. Encourage step-by-step problem solving. Ask the model to \"think step by step\" or \"reason through it\" \u2014 you\u2019ll get much more accurate and thoughtful responses.\n\n\n5. Remind it to act like an agent. Prompts like\n\u201cKeep going until the task is fully done\u201d\n\u201cUse tools when unsure\u201d\n\u201cPause and plan before every step\u201d\nhelp it behave more autonomously and reliably.\n\n\n6. Token window is massive but not infinite. GPT-4.1 handles up to 1M tokens, but quality drops if you overload it with too many retrievals or simultaneous reasoning tasks.\n\n\n7. Control the knowledge mode. If you want it to stick only to what you give it, say \u201cOnly use the provided context.\u201d If you want a hybrid answer, say \u201cCombine this with your general knowledge.\u201d\n\n\n8. Structure your prompts clearly. A reliable format I use:\nRole and Objective\nInstructions (break into parts)\nReasoning steps\nDesired Output Format\nExamples\nFinal task/request\n\n\n9. Teach it to retrieve smartly. Before answering from documents, ask it to identify which sources are actually relevant. Cuts down hallucination and improves focus.\n\n\n10. Avoid rare prompt structures. It sometimes struggles with repetitive formats or simultaneous tool usage. Test weird cases separately.\n\n\n11. Correct with one clear instruction. If it goes off the rails, don\u2019t overcomplicate the fix. A simple, direct correction often brings it back on track.\n\n\n12. Use diff-style formats for code. If you're doing code changes, using a diff-style format with clear context lines can seriously boost precision.\n\n\n13. It doesn\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d by default. GPT-4.1 isn\u2019t a reasoning-first model \u2014 you have to ask it explicitly to explain its logic or show its work.\n\n\nHope this helps anyone diving into GPT-4.1.
