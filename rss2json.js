The reporting judge, Magid Nauef L\u00e1uar, ruled that the defendant and the victim had a \"consensual affective bond\" and overturned the first-instance sentence that had condemned the suspect to nine years and four months in prison.\n\n\n\nHis vote was supported by the majority of the magistrates of the 9th Criminal Chamber of the Minas Gerais Court of Justice (TJMG). The decision provoked reactions from parliamentarians of different political persuasions, who condemned the defendant's acquittal (read more below).\n\n\n\nThe Penal Code establishes that having sexual intercourse or committing another lewd act with a minor under 14 years of age constitutes statutory rape. The Superior Court of Justice (STJ) has already established that the victim's consent, any prior sexual experience, or the existence of a romantic relationship do not preclude the occurrence of the crime.\n\n\n\nHowever, Judge Magid Nauef L\u00e1uar considered that the case, which occurred in Indian\u00f3polis, in the Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro region, has \"peculiarities\" that allow for the non-automatic application of binding precedents.\n\n\n\n\"The relationship between the accused and the minor did not result from an act of violence, coercion, fraud, or duress, but rather from a consensual affective bond, with the prior consent of the victim's parents and experienced in the presence of all,\" says an excerpt from the decision.\n\n\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office of Minas Gerais (MPMG) stated that it will identify the \"appropriate appeal route\" and adopt the \"appropriate procedural measures.\"\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the case\n\n\n\nThe MPMG filed charges against the suspect in April 2024 for rape of a vulnerable person due to the \"practice of carnal knowledge and lewd acts\" against the victim. The girl's mother was also charged because she allegedly \"failed to act\" despite being aware of the facts.\n\n\n\nAccording to investigations, the teenager was living with the man, with her mother's permission, and had stopped attending school.\n\n\n\nThe suspect, who has a criminal record for crimes such as homicide and drug trafficking, was arrested in the act on April 8, 2024, while with the victim.\n\n\n\nAt the police station, he admitted to having sexual relations with the girl. Her mother stated that she allowed the man to \"date\" her daughter.\n\n\n\nIn November 2025, both were sentenced by the 1st Criminal and Juvenile Court of the Araguari District to nine years and four months in prison.\n\n\n\nThe defendants appealed, and the appeal was reviewed by the 9th Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice of Minas Gerais (TJMG) this month.\n\n\n\nAcquittal\n\n\n\nUpon reviewing the case, the reporting judge, Magid Nauef L\u00e1uar, considered that the victim maintained with the defendant \"a relationship analogous to marriage, a fact that was known to her family.\"\n\n\n\nThe 9th Criminal Chamber of the TJMG (Court of Justice of Minas Gerais), by majority vote, decided to acquit the man and the girl's mother.\n\n\n\nThe MPMG (Public Prosecutor's Office of Minas Gerais) stated, in a note, that it will analyze the decision and take the appropriate procedural measures.\n\n\n\n\"The national legal system and the consolidated jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice \\[...\\] establish the absolute presumption of vulnerability for children and adolescents under 14 years of age. This normative guideline aims to safeguard the healthy development and sexual dignity of this population, treating them as inalienable legal assets, which prevail over any interpretation based on the alleged consent of the victim or family acquiescence,\" said the MPMG.\n\n\n\nThe Public Defender's Office of Minas Gerais, which appealed against the first-instance conviction, stated that it \"acted to guarantee the defendant's right to a full defense\" in compliance with its constitutional duties.\n\n\n\nAccording to the State Secretariat of Justice and Public Security (Sejusp), the suspect left the prison system on February 13, after a release order was granted by the court.\n\n\n\nPolitical Repercussions\n\n\n\nThis Friday (20), federal deputy Duda Salabert (PDT-MG) stated on social media that she would file a complaint against the Brazilian State with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights because of judicial decisions that \"have been relativizing the rape of vulnerable individuals.\"\n\n\n\n\"No child can legally consent to sexual violence. No family can legitimize abuse. Calling violence 'love' does not change the law. This complaint is not against a specific judge. It is against a structural failure of the State, which allows interpretations incompatible with the full protection of childhood,\" she wrote.\n\n\n\nFederal Deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL) said she would denounce the TJMG's decision to the National Council of Justice (CNJ).\n\n\n\n\"It's disgusting that, faced with a 35-year-old man who 'had a relationship' with a 12-year-old girl, the Justice system says there is no crime, but rather 'formation of a family'. There is no family there. There is a pedophile and a victim. And there is no 'relationship'. There is a crime, the rape of an incapacitated person,\" she posted.\n\n\n\nFederal Deputy Nikolas Ferreira (PL) also condemned the acquittal.\n\n\"The law is clear: for minors under 14 years old, any sexual relationship is statutory rape. It doesn't matter if they consented, if they've had other relationships, if they said they like him. The law is objective. \\[...\\] This is literally normalizing abuse,\" he said in a video posted on social media.\n\n\n\nMinistry of Human Rights speaks out\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Human Rights and Citizenship (MDHC) said in a statement that \"Brazil adopts the logic of comprehensive protection of children and adolescents, according to the Federal Constitution and the Statute of the Child and Adolescent (ECA).\"\n\n\n\n\"When the family does not ensure this protection \u2014 especially in cases of sexual violence \u2014 it is up to the State and society, including the three branches of government, to safeguard the rights of the child, and it is not admissible that family consent or self-declaration of marital ties be used to relativize violations,\" the ministry stated.\n\n\n\nThe MDHC also stated that it \"repudiates child marriage, a practice that constitutes a serious violation of human rights and deepens inequalities of gender, race, and class\" and that it \"has made international commitments to eliminate this practice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Judicial decisions, including those within the Courts of Justice, must be aligned with this normative framework, ensuring that no interpretation weakens the comprehensive protection of children and adolescents,\" it added.", "link": "https://g1.globo.com/mg/minas-gerais/noticia/2026/02/20/justica-de-mg-absolve-homem-de-35-anos-acusado-de-estupro-de-vulneravel-contra-menina-de-12.ghtml", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Selling Speech Datasets", "summary": "i am a private data collector based in Algeria.

The following year, the measures were softened to allow the two countries\u2019 para-athletes to compete as \u201cneutrals\u201d, meaning without national symbols such as flags and anthems.\n\nLast year, Russia and Belarus regained full membership rights in the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), after a vote by the organisation\u2019s member states to lift their partial suspensions.\n\nThat decision, which was jointly condemned by Poland and 32 other countries, opened the way for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under national flags.\n\nFinally, on Tuesday this week, the IPC announced that it had now granted permission for six Russian and four Belarusian para-athletes to take part in the upcoming games in Italy, which will take place from 6 to 15 March, under their national colours.\n\nThe decision was immediately condemned by Ukraine, whose foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, declared that \u201callowing the flags of aggressor states to be raised at the Paralympic Games while Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine rages on is wrong \u2014 morally and politically\u201d.\n\nHe said that Ukraine would urge other countries to boycott the opening ceremony of the games.\n\nThe EU\u2019s commissioner for sport, Glenn Micallef, announced on Wednesday that he would not attend the opening ceremony, saying that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Russian national symbols to appear while the country\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine continues.\n\nMeanwhile, Estonia\u2019s public broadcaster, ERR, has said it will not show events in which the Russian and Belarusian athletes are competing.\n\nPoland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s closest allies since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.
