Opponents of the deal had hoped that Italy would vote against it, helping create a blocking minority.\n\nBut, according to multiple news agencies, only Poland, France, Austria, Hungary and Ireland opposed the agreement. They together represent 29% of the EU\u2019s population, below the 35% threshold required to prevent a qualified majority.\n\nThe approval clears the way for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to travel to Paraguay to sign the agreement with Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The agreement eliminates tariffs on most trade between the two blocs.\n\nHowever, ahead of the vote, EU member states approved a safeguard clause aimed at protecting domestic producers from excessive agricultural imports. The mechanism will be triggered if prices of sensitive products such as beef, poultry or dairy fall by 5%, a stricter threshold than the previously proposed 8%.\n\nPoland\u2019s government has consistently opposed the Mercosur deal and, after today\u2019s vote, deputy prime minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz announced that his country would challenge the agreement at the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nPoland \u201cwill continue to fight for equal standards for European farmers\u201d, declared Kosiniak-Kamysz. Agricultural producers have argued that the Mercosur deal would result in imports of cheap South American food produced to lower standards, harming European agriculture and consumers.\n\nToday\u2019s vote came as farmers gathered in Warsaw for their latest protest against the agreement. Thousands joined a march through the capital towards the prime minister\u2019s office, carrying banners\u00a0reading \u201cStop EU-Mercosur\u201d, \u201cStop chemicals from Mercosur\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t kill Polish agriculture\u201d.\n\nWhile many farmers travelled to Warsaw by tractor, the municipal authorities barred the vehicles from entering the city centre, meaning hundeds of them were left on the outskirts, reported agricultural news service TopAgrar.

It has also caused tension within Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition, as the reform was strongly supported by The Left (Lewica).\n\nOn Tuesday, Tusk announced the suspension of work on the legislation, which would have given PIP inspectors the power to reclassify business-to-business (B2B) contracts or so-called \u201cjunk contracts\u201d (*umowy \u015bmieciowe*)\u00a0*as*\u00a0employment contracts (*umowy o prac\u0119*) in cases where a worker is effectively treated as an employee, despite being formally hired as a contractor.\n\nEmployment contracts come with stronger rights and benefits for workers, as well as more obligations for employers, than B2B contracts or junk contracts, a type of agreement that does not provide employment protection, wage protection and the right to holidays.\n\nThe planned reforms had been welcomed by PIP itself as well as trade unions. But they sparked anger among employers, particularly over a proposal that would have required businesses to pay up to three years of backdated employee social security contributions if a contractor was reclassified as an employee.\n\nJustifying his decision to suspend work on the reform, Tusk said that granting \u201cexcessive power for officials who will decide how people are employed would be very destructive for many companies and could also mean job losses for many people\u201d.\n\nPolish law defines employment as work performed under the supervision of a manager, at a place and time designated by the employer. Replacing an employment relationship with a B2B contract is unlawful.\n\nHowever, B2B contracts have nevertheless become a popular way for businesses to avoid employment contracts and cut labour costs.\n\nMoreover, people with sole-proprietorship (*jednoosobowa dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcza*) status benefit from preferential health insurance contributions for new businesses and can deduct some taxes, allowing workers to keep more income.\n\nThis form of work, however, also brings greater job insecurity, as it falls outside labour law protections, and often results in lower pensions due to reduced contributions. It also reduces income tax revenues and health insurance contributions to the state, at a time when Poland is facing\u00a0[rapidly rising debt](\n\nWork on the PIP reform followed an agreement with the European Commission reached at the beginning of last year, after Poland[\u00a0abandoned](\u00a0plans to introduce social security contributions for \u201cjunk contracts\u201d that had been agreed with the EU under the former government.\n\nThe proposed PIP reform went beyond expanding inspectors\u2019 powers. It also included provisions for data exchange between the state Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), PIP and National Revenue Administration (KAS), streamlining inspections through remote controls and electronic documentation, and introducing new fines for violations of workers\u2019 rights.\n\nIn early December 2025, the standing committee of the Council of Ministers, a key inter-ministerial body, approved a draft PIP reform bill prepared by the family, labour and social policy ministry.\n\nAlthough the full draft bill was not made public,\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0reported that inspectors could decide whether a worker had been an employee up to three years in the past, which could force businesses to retrospectively pay social security contributions and taxes.\n\nTusk\u2019s decision now to abandon the plans has prompted concern from his coalition partners over both the protection of workers and the fact that Poland could lose EU funds.\n\nW\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, one of the leaders of The Left and the speaker of the Sejm, the lower house of parliament, said that, if the necessary reforms are not implemented, Poland could lose 11 billion zloty (\u20ac2.6 billion), reports the Interia news website. He announced that he would be meeting with Tusk this week to discuss the matter.\n\nThe minister for funds and regional policy, Katarzyna Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz of the centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050), likewise warned of \u201cmulti-billion costs\u201d.\n\nShe told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that Poland may try to revise its agreement with the EU, but that this would be difficult given that funds have to be allocated this year.\n\nMeanwhile, labour minister Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-B\u0105k, also from The Left, expressed her willingness to work on a new solution.\n\n\u201cIf there is an expectation to discuss other tools, we are ready for such a discussion. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but the goal remains the same, because we want to protect Polish workers,\u201d she said.\n\nTusk\u2019s decision was criticised by Piotr Ostrowski, chairman of All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), who told broadcaster TVN that it appears \u201cthe prime minister doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about\u201d. He suggested that Tusk was effectively \u201callowing noncompliance\u201d with existing labour law.\n\nHowever, Marek Kowalski, head of the Federation of Polish Entrepreneurs (FPP), welcomed the fact that the prime minister had \u201clistened to the voice of business owners\u201d.\n\nHe argued that labour inspectors lack the expertise to determine employment status and warned that the reform could raise costs for businesses, ultimately harming workers themselves.\n\nBut the head of PIP, Marcin Stanecki, defended the proposed reforms, saying that they would be \u201cvery beneficial for both business owners and the National Labour Inspectorate\u201d, reports PAP. He expressed his readiness to help clarify any doubts around the proposed measures.\n\nA survey by IBRiS for the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily published this week found that over 60% of Poles support giving PIP the power to convert B2B and junk contracts into employment contracts.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/08/poland-suspends-work-on-labour-reform-risking-billions-in-eu-funds/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Farmers block highways across Greece in protest over rising costs and EU trade deal", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/greece-farmers-protests-europe-mercosur-2c15d088553c652ffa94bcc9fb2b6dbf", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why the UAE is Cutting Scholarships to the United Kingdom", "summary": "", "link": "https://mediatalkafrica.com/253138/why-the-uae-is-cutting-scholarships-to-the-united-kingdom/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Men used to go to war but now ?", "summary": "But now we all gain a subconscious and don\u2019t want to die for old politicians who have a big self ego.
