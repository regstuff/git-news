I have some older references (4-6 yrs old) from O'reilly/Manning/Packt on NLP, but I am not sure if they'd still be relevant. Comment if I can use these. \n\n  \n2. Can someone also demistify if I should continue learning to build stuff using Pytorch and transformers lib (which I believe is the richer format for learning) or should I learn FastAI. I really am not looking forward to rapid prototyping atm but everyone tells me its relevant. \n\n3.  How did you teach yourself to build NLP projects? Any insights into the process are welcome. How does one build project today - is it all about pre-trained models? what's the better thought process?\n\n  \nBackground - I understand theoretical concepts around NLP (and deep learning in general) but I am not well versed with the recent developments after the transformers. I am also comfortable writing code with Pytorch. Looking forward to build basic to advanced projects around NLP in a systematic and an organized learning format in order to develop skill. \n\nApologies in advance if I have asked too much in a single post.
