For context I'm using a finetuned model for a roleplay scenario and provide the character information in the system prompt. It adds up to around 1,600 tokens for the whole system prompt.\n\nThe issue is that when I am talking to the model and asking it questions, it is very inconsistent in its ability to answer accurately. For example it will be able to get the correct % of alcohol in the beers it drinks but not how regurlaly it drinks, or know that it is retired but on asking gives the wrong job it used to do. It is able to give very accurate answers and then immediatedly give completely incorrect ones.\n\nI've previously used the 8B model and not noticed this issue but found it overall to be lacking so upgraded but this is a significant issue. I've tried to look into why this is a bit but come up short outside of the possibility that this is a context issue which doesn't make sense since it should have an enourmous context for this type of task. Is it possible that my training dataset which used Alpacca conversation style caused a reduction in the size of the context due to the short examples? If so how can I adress this.\n\nI thought that maybe it was overfitting since the training data did have examples of bus drivers, but this was only 2 examples of over 1000 and this alone doesn't conclude it being an overfitting problem since if it was a context error it would also likely draw from it's finetuning dataset to replace the information it lacks. I also purposely kept the epoch count low to avoid this.\n\nHow can I go about testing this issue? I know I could implement a system for regular reminders but since it starts confabulating early into a conversation (&lt;500 tokens), it feels like there is a more core problem to address whether that is finetuning, hardware or something else.\n\nFor context I am using a Nvidia A40 so 48GB of vRAM and used Unsloth for the training with these hyperparameters:\n\n    max_seq_length = 4096\n    dtype = None \n    load_in_4bit = True\n    \n    model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 model_name = \"unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-instruct-bnb-4bit\",\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 max_seq_length = max_seq_length,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 dtype = dtype,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit,)\n    \n    model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 model,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 r = 16, # Choose any number &gt; 0 !
