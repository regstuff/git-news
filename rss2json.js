My own database is extensive, and because we\u2019re dealing with healthcare, near-perfect accuracy is absolutely crucial. Even the smallest errors could lead to significant real-world consequences, which is why I\u2019m aiming to explore every viable option out there.\n\nOne of the key factors in my situation is that hardware limitations aren\u2019t a big concern, so memory optimization and things like that aren\u2019t at the top of my priority list. Instead, I\u2019m focusing on reliability, speed, and, most importantly, pushing accuracy as far as possible. Hugging Face Transformers with DeepSpeed seems like a tried and true combination I\u2019ve heard about how it can optimize training and inference, and the community support is pretty robust. At the same time, I\u2019ve been hearing more frequent mentions of Unsloth and how it might excel in specialized, high-precision contexts.\n\nWhat really intrigues me is how these solutions might differ in actual performance when handling large-scale medical datasets. In a domain where the margin for error is so slim, it\u2019s important to weigh the advantages and drawbacks of each approach. Of course, every workflow and dataset is different, but I\u2019m curious if anyone has encountered specific benefits or pitfalls when using Unsloth compared to Transformers with DeepSpeed or vice versa.\n\nI\u2019d love to open up a discussion on what people\u2019s experiences have been. Have you found that one setup more naturally suits the needs of a healthcare-related project? Are there any unexpected challenges or trade offs that come with Unsloth? On the flip side, do Transformers paired with DeepSpeed live up to their reputation for efficiency without compromising on accuracy? If anyone has stories, benchmarks, or just general insights on how these tools hold up under rigorous requirements, I\u2019d be really interested to hear more about it.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1i713qj/unsloth_vs_hugging_face_transformers_accuracy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open-source conversational AI agents for internal tools", "summary": "", "link": "http://github.com/inferablehq/inferable", "author": "None"}, {"title": "If you dig DeepSeek and Cursor as much as I do, check this project out: \n\nIt makes possible to use DeepSeek model in Cursor's Composer as 'gpt-4o'\n\nP.S.: It's not perfect, but it's a start \ud83d\ude0a Contributions are more than welcome!", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/danilofalcao/cursor-deepseek", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is there some list of the totality of ALL LLMs created so far?", "summary": "Zephyr, hermes, normal llama, qwen, mistral etc..\n\nIs there like a list showing them ALL, and perhaps even with a use of each, date of creation and link to it?\n\nEven just a list of names can be good.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1i78p34/is_there_some_list_of_the_totality_of_all_llms/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine ready to talk peace with Donald Trump, looks to India for support", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ukraine-ready-talk-peace-donald-trump-india-support-9789695/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Same-sex marriages will soon become legal in Thailand after historic law", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/-sex-marriages-will-soon-become-legal-thailand-historic-law-rcna188514", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trum\u0440\u2019s UN ambassador pick says Israel has \u2018biblical right\u2019 to West Bank", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/21/trumps-un-ambassador-pick-says-israel-has-biblical-right-to-west-bank", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Islamists demand security doctrine to help Bangladesh army counter Indian military", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/islamists-demand-security-doctrine-to-help-bangladesh-army-counter-indian-military/articleshow/117406290.cms?from=mdr", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Same-sex marriage finally legalised in Thailand, Marriage Equality Act is effecting today onwards.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thaipbs.or.th/news/content/348418", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Syria Terminates Russian Naval Base Deal", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/01/22/syria-terminates-russian-naval-base-deal-reports-a87690", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Family's 100-pound pet tortoise found safe after surviving Eaton Fire", "summary": "", "link": "https://abc7.com/post/california-wildfires-familys-100-pound-pet-tortoise-found-safe-surviving-eaton-fire/15819120/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India should reciprocate if U.S. imposes additional duties on domestic goods: Trade experts", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-should-reciprocate-if-us-imposes-additional-duties-on-domestic-goods-trade-experts/article69122935.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I have no idea which master thesis", "summary": "As the title says, I have huge doubts about the thesis I should do in my master.
