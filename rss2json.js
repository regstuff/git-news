This is a necessary prerequisite for PyTorch to utilize GPU acceleration.\n* As the PyTorch version depends on the versions of CUDA drivers used, we need to install PyTorch specific to the CUDA drivers installed previously. Mismatched versions often cause compatibility issues.\n* On Windows, we need Windows SDK and a compatible C/C++ compiler to run some dependencies, so using Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) we can easily install those required components for proper compilation.\n* Finally, we updated **pyproject.toml** to support direct installation of all dependencies and **unsloth**, ensuring the package can be installed with a **single command** without manual intervention.\n\n**Testing Details**\n\n* Tested on 4 python versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12.\n* Tested for 3 different CUDA versions - 11.8, 12.4, 12.6\n* Tested on 2 windows machines with different GPUs to test support across different drivers - GTX 1650, RTX 3050", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1j0jbbi/unsloth_now_works_for_windows/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian media in white house !!", "summary": "In a very first,\n\n[A Russian state media reporter gained entry to the Oval Office for Trump-Zelensky sit-down ](\n\nAmerican reporters from Reuters and AP News were excluded from the meeting.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1j0okhm/russian_media_in_white_house/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mistreatment of Ukraine is Increase of nuclear proliferation", "summary": "More you see Ukraine being hauled under the bus and humiliated all along, you have to pause and wonder what it is going to mean for others watching this.\n\nThis is a former Nuclear Power (!) which gave up it\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpiles on the security guarantees of the West!\n\nLooking back, this is probably the Dumbest Strategic move in recent geopolitical history!!\n\nThis just means anyone who has some nuclear capabilities will fight preserve it at all costs! \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1j0gnso/mistreatment_of_ukraine_is_increase_of_nuclear/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Best and safest libraries to train a NER model (in python)", "summary": "Most out-of-the-box NER models just don't really fit my use case very well and I am therefore looking to train my own.

For example statements like \"This study is empirical research.\" or \"This study is a review.\".\n\nI've tried doing this by splitting the abstracts into sentences and computing the cosine similarity with SBERT embeddings. I then took the top 3 sentences of every abstract, checked how relevant they are for the statement, and set the threshold to the decision boundary of what i identified as relevant or not relevant. This works okay for some of the statements (F1 between 0.7 and 0.8), but quite bad for others (between 0.1 and 0.5). Got any idea how this could be improved? Is there a specific way how statements/criteria need to be worded for good similarity measures?\n\nAnother approach i've tried is NLI with DeBERTa, where i take the abstract as premise and the statement as hypothesis. The problem with that is, that i get a lot of neutrals and some contradictory results that are clearly incorrect. My guess would be that the training data just doesn't have a focus on scentific articles. Is there maybe a good dataset i could use for fine tuning?\n\nEvery input is appreciated :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1j037ps/checking_statements_against_paper_abstracts/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ohio Bus Driver Praised for Saving 15 Students from Burning School Bus", "summary": "", "link": "https://people.com/ohio-bus-driver-saves-15-students-burning-school-bus-11688202", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Historic preservation in the US", "summary": "Hello Everyone\n\nI'm curious about the state of the Historic Preservation field in the United States.
