However, it successfully repelled the cyberattack.\n\nThe digital affairs minister says that \u201ceverything points to Russian sabotage\u201d being behind the incident.\n\n\u201cIn the final days of 2025, a large-scale attempt was made to hack the energy system,\u201d said energy minister Mi\u0142osz Motyka at a press conference on Tuesday.\u00a0It was \u201cthe most powerful attack on the Polish power system in years\u201d\u00a0 but \u201cwas successfully repelled\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve encountered multiple attempts at attacks on individual generating sources \u2013 solar farms and even individual wind turbines,\u201d explained Motyka.

Asked if Poland had \u201ccome close to blackout\u201d during the incident, he confirmed it had been \u201cvery close\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe scale of this attack, the vector of entry and who was behind it indicate that it was a coordinated operation intended to deliberately cut off power to Polish citizens,\u201d continued Gawkowski. \u201cEverything points to Russian sabotage\u2026intended to destabilise the situation in Poland.\u201d\n\nHowever, the \u201cPolish security services and the Polish institutions responsible for cybersecurity rose to the occasion\u201d, added the minister. \u201cWe have well-prepared institutions and there is no need to panic; Poland is the most \\[cyber\\]attacked country in the European Union.\u201d\n\nPoland has in recent years suffered a series of so-called\u00a0[hybrid actions orchestrated by Russia]( including both cyberattacks and physical acts of sabotage, as well as disinformation and propaganda campaigns.\n\nLast week, Motyka revealed that hacker attacks on Polish energy infrastructure had increased during recent cold weather conditions, which have seen temperatures plummet to below -15 degrees Centigrade in many places and energy use\u00a0[surge to record levels](", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/14/poland-suffers-major-cyberattack-on-power-grid-says-russia-likely-responsible/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan nears 10% foreign population years ahead of official forecasts", "summary": "", "link": "https://share.google/sTvELLRpKaw67e3Ry", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ISS astronauts begin journey back to Earth in Nasa\u2019s first ever medical evacuation", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2026/jan/15/first-medical-evacuation-nasa-astronauts-back-to-earth", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Landmark Rohingya genocide case against Myanmar heard at top UN court", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7v07m3pr75o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia claims 'Antichrist' is targeting Lithuania", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2806076/russia-claims-antichrist-is-targeting-lithuania", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The death toll from a crackdown on protests in Iran jumps to at least 2,571, activists say", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-war-nuclear-economy-1b2368e0804676d33d6aa0696815a102", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan\u2019s government returns to capital after nearly 3 years of war", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgn5g90lggo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "(Cyprus) Body found in Pissouri area during search for missing Russian tycoon", "summary": "- A large-scale [search and rescue mission]( launched on Sunday morning to locate 56-year-old Russian businessman Vladislav Baumgertner, who has been missing since 7 January.\n\n- The disappearance of the [former Uralkali chief]( has cast a fresh light on the complex web of potash logistics involving Cyprus.\n\n- There is also intrigue that a [senior Russian diplomat died]( around the time that Baumgertner went missing.", "link": "https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/local/body-found-pissouri-british-bases-baumgertner-2026/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ISIS Warns Nigerian Christians to Convert, \u2018Spare Their Blood\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://billygraham.org/decision-magazine/articles/isis-warns-nigerian-christians-to-convert-spare-their-blood", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Egypt bombs RSF convoy days before Saddam Haftar's Cairo visit", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newarab.com/news/egypt-bombs-rsf-convoy-days-saddam-haftars-cairo-visit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Over 500 million illicit arms flood West Africa, 40% in Nigeria, says Nigeria\u2019s Defence minister Musa", "summary": "", "link": "https://guardian.ng/news/over-500m-illicit-arms-flood-west-africa-40-in-nigeria-says-cds-musa/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pacts, patronage and fear: how Myanmar's junta chief holds on to power", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pacts-patronage-fear-how-myanmars-junta-chief-holds-power-2026-01-13/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan brewery exporting after near 50-year ban", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scmp.com/video/asia/3338527/pakistans-oldest-brewery-regains-export-licence-after-nearly-50-years", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
