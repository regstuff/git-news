LongEval differs from traditional IR and classification shared tasks with special considerations on evaluating models that mitigate performance drop over time. It encourages participants to develop temporal information retrieval systems and longitudinal text classifiers that survive through dynamic temporal text changes, introducing time as a new dimension for ranking models performance.  \nThe lab consists of two tasks:  \n\\* Task 1. LongEval-Retrieval: The goal of Task 1 is to propose an information retrieval system which can handle changes over the time. The proposed retrieval system should follow the temporal timewise evolution of Web documents. Contact: longeval-ir-task@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr  \n\\* Task 2. LongEval-Classification: The goal of Task 2 is to propose a temporal persistence classifier which can mitigate performance drop over short and long periods of time compared to a test set from the same time frame as training.

Nevertheless, explanations of how such  fine-tuning influences the internal computations in these models remain  elusive. We study how fine-tuning affects the internal mechanisms  implemented in language models. As a case study, we explore the property  of entity tracking, a crucial facet of language comprehension, where  models fine-tuned on mathematics have substantial performance gains. We  identify the mechanism that enables entity tracking and show that (i) in  both the original model and its fine-tuned versions primarily the same  circuit implements entity tracking. In fact, the entity tracking circuit  of the original model on the fine-tuned versions performs better than  the full original model. (ii) The circuits of all the models implement  roughly the same functionality: Entity tracking is performed by tracking  the position of the correct entity in both the original model and its  fine-tuned versions. (iii) Performance boost in the fine-tuned models is  primarily attributed to its improved ability to handle the augmented  positional information. To uncover these findings, we employ: Patch  Patching, DCM, which automatically detects model components responsible  for specific semantics, and **CMAP**, a new approach for patching  activations across models to reveal improved mechanisms. Our findings  suggest that fine-tuning enhances, rather than fundamentally alters, the  mechanistic operation of the model.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1c599uw/finetuning_enhances_existing_mechanisms_a_case/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Paris 2024: Olympic flame is lit in choreographed event high in symbolism", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Paris 2024: Olympic flame is lit in choreographed event high in symbolism</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTYvc3BvcnQvcGFyaXMtMjAyNC1vbHltcGljLWZsYW1lLWxpdC1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-16", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Inaugural Esports World Cup in Saudi Arabia, worth more than $60M, hopes to send \u2018positive message\u2019 to industry", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Inaugural Esports World Cup in Saudi Arabia, worth more than $60M, hopes to send \u2018positive message\u2019 to industry</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTYvc3BvcnQvZXNwb3J0cy13b3JsZC1jdXAtc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-16", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Emmanuel Macron says Olympic Opening Ceremony could be changed in case of terrorism threat", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Emmanuel Macron says Olympic Opening Ceremony could be changed in case of terrorism threat</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTYvc3BvcnQvbWFjcm9uLW9seW1waWMtb3BlbmluZy1jZXJlbW9ueS10ZXJyb3Jpc20tdGhyZWF0LXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-16", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso spent their careers against each other.
