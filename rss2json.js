One of these tasks involves participants being presented with a series of short phrases (in the form of items you might find on a to-do list, think \"unpack dishwasher\" or \"schedule appointment\"), which they are later asked to recall. During pilot testing, I noticed that many testers wouldn't recall the exact wording of the target phrase but their response would nevertheless capture its meaning - for instance, they might answer \"empty dishwasher\", which effectively means the same thing as \"unpack dishwasher\", right? Made me think about how verbs tend to have more semantic overlap than nouns do, and as such, I thought it might be worthwhile to do a sort of dual-tiered scoring system, with participants having scores for both correct (verbatim) and correct (semantic).\n\n-\n\nSo! My question is: how would I best go about measuring the semantic similarity between the target phrase and the recalled response, in order to determine whether a response should be marked semantically correct?
