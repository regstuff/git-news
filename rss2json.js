I think we need to have a clear strategy on Pakistan. Would we prefer them as a stable democracy or as an unstable corrupt state (which it currently is)? I believe its obvious that it is the latter, since from a position of internal chaos it would not be able to employ an effective strategy against India in Kashmir or elsewhere, whereas a stable and stronger Pakistan may be able to undermine India in Kashmir.\n3. Some people have fantasies of annexing Pakistan in the long run but I believe this is a complete pipe dream, even if we become 50x as powerful as them.

The courses are beginner friendly and as interactive as you'd like to make them. I'll share the links and descriptions of each course below.\n\n[Ancient Maya Art and Power](\n\nA course focused on how Maya rulers communicated their power through art. We'll discuss the Tikal-Calakmul conflicts, the importance of Pakal and Palenque, the lintels of Yaxchil\u00e1n, and the Sacred Cenote of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and its connections to the rest of Mesoamerica.\n\n[Maya Mythology in Ceramics](\n\nThis course discusses the creation, context, and mythology represented on Maya ceramic vessels. We will compare myths shown on pots with stories from the Popol Vuh, discuss the\u00a0*wahyoob*' creatures shown on vessels, and examine creation myths and \"just-so\" stories.\n\n[Teotihuacan: Where One Becomes a God](\n\nAn introductory course on the Central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. We'll cover how and when the city was built, who lived there, what we know about the \"collapse\" of Teotihuacan, and its lasting legacy for the Maya, the Aztec, and more.\n\n[Reading and Writing Maya Glyphs](\n\nThis is a beginner-level course on how to read and write Maya hieroglyphs. I co-teach this course with my colleague Julia Kausch, an artist who specializes in detailed replicas of ancient Maya glyphs and art. Participants will learn the basics of reading Maya glyphs and how to write glyphic phrases using a brush or a pen.\n\nCourses start next week (with the exception of the last one, which starts May 22nd). I have limited each course to 10 participants per group so that I can personalize the content, but I'll re-run each course throughout the summer for those who can't take the first round!\n\nHope to see you there,\n\nCatherine Nuckols, Ph.D.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ccwfz0/online_courses_about_the_ancient_maya_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "We might be closer to changing course on climate change than we realized", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NSA Doval in Russia: Security cooperation in focus", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.financialexpress.com/business/defence-nsa-doval-in-russia-security-cooperation-in-focus-3468139/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "German minister calls on 'superrich' to pay for climate", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/german-minister-calls-on-superrich-to-pay-for-climate/a-68916500", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kremlin Says Ukraine Access to ATACMS Will Not Impact Outcome of Conflict", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/04/25/kremlin-says-ukraine-access-to-atacms-will-not-impact-outcome-of-conflict-a84957", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Azerbaijan Asks India to Halt Arms Supply to Armenia Citing National Security Concerns", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.news18.com/amp/world/azerbaijan-asks-india-to-halt-arms-supply-to-armenia-citing-national-security-concerns-8865422.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Masked attackers storm anti-fascist event in Sweden", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/masked-attackers-storm-anti-fascist-event-sweden-2024-04-24/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Ry\u014dy\u016b Kobayashi flies 291 meters through the air in landmark ski jump, but his effort wasn\u2019t \u2018in line with FIS regulations\u2019", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Ry\u014dy\u016b Kobayashi flies 291 meters through the air in landmark ski jump, but his effort wasn\u2019t \u2018in line with FIS regulations\u2019</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvc3BvcnQvcnlveXUta29iYXlhc2hpLXNraS1qdW1wLWljZWxhbmQtaW50bC1zcHQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvc3BvcnQvcnlveXUta29iYXlhc2hpLXNraS1qdW1wLWljZWxhbmQtaW50bC1zcHQ?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-25", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jurgen Klopp\u2019s \u2018Last Dance\u2019 falls flat as Liverpool stunned by local rival Everton to drop out of Premier League title race", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Jurgen Klopp\u2019s \u2018Last Dance\u2019 falls flat as Liverpool stunned by local rival Everton to drop out of Premier League title race</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvc3BvcnQvanVyZ2VuLWtsb3BwLWxpdmVycG9vbC1ldmVydG9uLXByZW1pZXItbGVhZ3VlLXRpdGxlLXJhY2Utc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-25", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tiger Woods\u2019 15-year-old son Charlie to attempt US Open qualification", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Tiger Woods\u2019 15-year-old son Charlie to attempt US Open qualification</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvc3BvcnQvY2hhcmxpZS13b29kcy11cy1vcGVuLXF1YWxpZmljYXRpb24tc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-25", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Let\u2019s hoop\u2019: Miami Heat shock Boston Celtics to level first-round playoff series", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Let\u2019s hoop\u2019: Miami Heat shock Boston Celtics to level first-round playoff series</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvc3BvcnQvbWlhbWktaGVhdC1zaG9jay1ib3N0b24tY2VsdGljcy1wbGF5b2Zmcy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-25", "author": "None"}]}}};
