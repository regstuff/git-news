Like, it\u2019s not even close.\n\nHere\u2019s why this works so much better:\n\n* **Surgical tweaking**\u00a0\\- you know exactly what parameter controls what\n* **Easy variations**\u00a0\\- change just the camera movement, or just the lighting, or just the subject\n* **No guessing**\u00a0\\- instead of \u201chmm what if I change this random word\u201d you\u2019re systematically adjusting known variables\n\n# Real example from last week:\n\nSaw this viral clip of someone walking through a cyberpunk city. Instead of trying to write my own prompt, I asked Claude to reverse-engineer it into JSON.\n\nGot back something like:\n\n    {  \"shot_type\": \"medium shot\",  \"subject\": \"person in hoodie\",  \"action\": \"walking confidently\",  \"environment\": \"neon-lit city street\",  \"camera_movement\": \"tracking shot, following behind\",  \"lighting\": \"neon reflections on wet pavement\",  \"color_grade\": \"teal and orange, high contrast\"}\n\nThen I could easily test variations:\n\n* Change \u201cwalking confidently\u201d to \u201climping slowly\u201d\n* Swap \u201ctracking shot\u201d for \u201cdolly forward\u201d\n* Try \u201cpurple and pink\u201d instead of \u201cteal and orange\u201d\n\n**The result?**\u00a0Instead of 20+ random iterations, I got usable content in 3-4 tries.\n\nI\u2019ve been using\u00a0[these guys](\u00a0for my generations since Google\u2019s pricing is absolutely brutal for this kind of testing. they\u2019re somehow offering veo3 at like 60-70% below Google\u2019s direct pricing which makes the iteration approach actually viable.\n\n# The bigger lesson here\n\nDon\u2019t start from scratch when something\u2019s already working. The reverse-engineering approach with JSON formatting has been my biggest breakthrough this year.\n\nMost people are trying to reinvent the wheel with their prompts.

See Trump isn't not much concerned about the world or anyone buying Russian oil , even USA purchase some goods from Russia , well you know mid-term elections in USA are coming and at this point the promise of \"ending Ukraine-Russia war in 10 days is yet to be fulfilled\" and also inflation is going high , then recent development related to ICE has made to get at-least something , so this summit was that \"SOMETHING\" to show the american public that yes sure credit is that a summit without any chaos was held credit goes to Trump and his administration there .\n\nWell now talking about India and tariffs , well i feel USA tried this with China back in May 2025 and they know how China retaliated and which also hitted the USA economy , so China is ruled out , now there is Brazil and India they got tariffs and Mr. Lula retaliated too not as hard as China but still , so who left which can talk with Russia and also dependent on USA \\[military equipment and various products\\] is India and India doesn't gave any such statements and also Mr. Modi have totally rejected the claim on the ceasefire involment of USA with Pak .\n\nSo all and all these tariffs or giving Pak asim munir is more because of Russia and Iran not any trade deficit or India not an strategic partner no more .\n\nBUT now there will be no such additional tariffs and also the extra 25% i feel USA will not implement that too \\[effective date was 27th AUG 2025\\] as Trump has got something to talk so the agriculture thing may settle down for a bit and Trump administration may even try to look for a SHORT TERM TRADE DEAL with India , basically they also depends on India its a very big market for USA and also many skilled individual go to USA , so i do not think there will be any additional tariffs as that will only backfire now as democrats said Russia is not getting any deal for now so whats the point of destroying relations with India and making QUAD a non-relevant grp \\[which is becoming will make a post on that after sometime\\]\n\n**Thank you , if you read all of it .

That\u2019s not how AI video works. You need to embrace the iteration process.\n\n# Seed Bracketing Technique:\n\nThis changed everything for me:\n\n**The Method:**\n\n* Run the same prompt with seeds 1000-1010\n* Judge each result on shape and readability\n* Pick the best 2-3 for further refinement\n* Use those as base seeds for micro-adjustments\n\n**Why This Works:** Same prompts under slightly different scenarios (different seeds) generate completely different results. It\u2019s like taking multiple photos with slightly different camera settings - one of them will be the keeper.\n\n# What I Learned After 1000+ Generations:\n\n1. **AI video is about iteration, not perfection** \\- The goal is multiple attempts to find gold, not nailing it once\n2. **10 decent videos then selecting beats 1 \u201cperfect prompt\u201d video** \\- Volume approach with selection outperforms single perfect attempt\n3. **Budget for failed generations** \\- They\u2019re part of the process, not a bug\n\n# The Cost Reality Check:\n\nGoogle\u2019s pricing is brutal:\n\n* $0.50 per second means 1 minute = $30\n* 1 hour = $1,800\n* A 5-minute YouTube video = $150 (only if perfect on first try)\n\nFactor in failed generations and you\u2019re looking at 3-5x that cost easily.\n\n# Game Changing Discovery:\n\nidk how but Found [these guys]( veo3gen\\[.\\]app offers the same Veo3 model at 75-80% less than Google\u2019s direct pricing. Makes the volume approach actually financially viable instead of being constrained by cost.\n\nThis literally changed how I approach AI video generation. Instead of being precious about each generation, I can now afford to test multiple seed variations, different prompt structures, and actually iterate until I get something great.\n\n**The workflow that works:**\n\n1. Start with base prompt\n2. Generate 5-8 seed variations\n3. Select best 2-3\n4. Refine those with micro-adjustments\n5. Generate final variations\n6. Select winner\n\nVolume testing becomes practical when you\u2019re not paying Google\u2019s premium pricing.\n\nhope this helps &lt;3", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1msbbbk/how_to_not_generate_ai_slop_generate_veo3_videos/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Photo editing?", "summary": "Does anyone know of a prompt to work around built in restrictions to edit photos as requested?
