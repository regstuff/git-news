However, after a campaign characterised by anti-Jewish, anti-Ukrainian and anti-LGBT rhetoric, Braun\u00a0[finished fourth](\u00a0in the presidential election, with 6.3% of the vote.\n\nHis KPP party, which blends Catholic ultraconservatism, economic libertarianism, monarchism and anti-EU sentiment, has now built on that success.\n\nBraun, who is a member of the European Parliament, and KPP were until this year part of the broader Confederation, which was formed in 2018 by a collection of far-right movements in order to stand jointly in elections.\n\nHowever, Braun and his party were ejected from the alliance in January this year after he announced his presidential candidacy despite Confederation having picked another of its leaders, S\u0142awomir Mentzen, as its official candidate.\n\nBraun has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories. Last month, he\u00a0[said](\u00a0that the Polish government is \u201cimplementing directives presented\u2026by various Jewish organisations\u201d.

He called for homosexuality to be criminalised and \u201csodomites sent to prison\u201d.\n\nLast week, Braun went on trial in Warsaw accused of crimes relating to four incidents, most infamously an\u00a0[attack](\u00a0on a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah in parliament in December 2023. He claimed in court that he is being prosecuted because he \u201cdared to defend myself against Jewish supremacy\u201d.\n\nBraun and his party have also campaigned against what they call the \u201cUkrainisation\u201d of Poland, suggesting that the large number of Ukrainian refugees and immigrants is a threat to Polish identity and sovereignty.\n\nHe has long been accused of having sympathies towards and links to Russia.

It will be transferred to a museum.\n\nDuring a press conference in front of workers taking the table apart, Nawrocki declared that his decision marked the \u201cend of post-communism in Poland\u201d.\n\nThat refers to a term used by many on the Polish right to refer to the idea that Poland did not really regain its freedom in 1989, and instead continued to be ruled by a \u201cpost-communist elite\u201d made up of figures from the former regime and traitors from the democratic opposition.\n\nThe so-called Round Table Talks took place in Poland from February to April 1989 between representatives of the communist authorities and members of the democratic opposition, including the\u00a0[Solidarity trade union](\u00a0that had led opposition to the regime.\n\nThe talks led to partially free elections in June that year, which in turn helped pave the way for the downfall of the communist regime. Events in Poland also added momentum to the downfall of communism in other countries around the Soviet Bloc.\n\nThe Round Table Talks involved many figures who went on to hold prominent positions in post-communist Poland, including two presidents, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the leader of Solidarity, and Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, who had been on the communist side of the table.\n\nThe fact that some former communists continued to hold important positions in politics, business, the security services, the media and the judiciary has been used by some, in particular the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, to\u00a0[argue](\u00a0that the events of 1989 actually represented a betrayal.\n\nThey argue that the agreements reached at that time saw an elite made up of both former communists and some elements of the democratic opposition retain real power in Poland.\n\nSpeaking today, Nawrocki, who is aligned with PiS, echoed this sentiment. Celebrations that communism had ended in 1989 turned out to be \u201cpremature\u201d, said the president. \u201cBecause, as we know, communist elites and security service officers after 1989 \\[continued to\\] play an important role.\u201d\n\nHe accused some of the opposition figures who sat at the round table of having a form of \u201cStockholm syndrome in which all the crimes of the communist system were forgiven and those who murdered Poles were still supported in a symbolic and political sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday, a free, independent, sovereign and ambitious Poland can do much more than idealise the round table,\u201d continued the president. \u201cWe cannot infect future generations of Poles with the backwardness of the communist system.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, in the 21st century, young Poles \u2013 those born in the 1990s and 2000s, but also my generation \u2013 do not have to make deals with former dictators, communists or post-communists,\u201d added Nawrocki, who was born in 1983.\n\nThe removal of the round table means that \u201cI can proudly say that post-communism has today ended in Poland\u201d, declared Nawrocki. \u201cLong live a free Poland.\u201d\n\nThe president, an academic historian who previously led the state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), acknowledged that discussion of the significance of the Round Table Talks is still ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe Round Table Talks cannot be forgotten because they are and will remain an important part of the historical discussion,\u201d he declared. \u201cBut neither can they be romanticised by paying tribute to them at the presidential palace.\u201d\n\nInstead, the table will be moved to the recently opened Polish History Museum in Warsaw, where it will be part of the main exhibition, due to open in 2027.\n\nSpeaking later to news website Onet, the museum\u2019s spokesman, Micha\u0142 Przeperski, said that the idea of removing the round table from the presidential palace dated back to the time of Nawrocki\u2019s predecessor, Andrzej Duda, who was also aligned with PiS.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s decision was, however, mocked by a member of the government, which has regularly been in conflict with the president.\n\nInterior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski sarcastically suggested that perhaps having the round table in his palace had \u201cstung the eyes\u201d of Nawrocki because it is \u201ca symbol for the entire world of a peaceful, bloodless and exemplary transition from dictatorship to democracy\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s current ruling coalition is accused by PiS of being part of the \u201cpost-communist elites\u201d that have ruled Poland since 1989. However, the government argues that it was PiS, during its time in power from 2015 to 2023, that undermined Polish democracy.\n\n*This article has been updated to include comments from the Polish History Museum\u2019s spokesman.*", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/18/president-removes-round-table-at-which-end-of-communism-in-poland-was-negotiated-from-his-palace/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
