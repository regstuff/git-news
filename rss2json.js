They acknowledged that \u201cterrible things have been done to the Polish people by Germans and in the name of the German people\u201d.\n\nThe exchange sparked anger at the time from Poland\u2019s communist rulers, whose propaganda presented West Germany as the country\u2019s continued enemy. They accused the Polish bishops of betraying the national interest.\n\nAs part of their gathering this week, the heads of Poland and Germany\u2019s Catholic episcopates signed a\u00a0[joint declaration]( expressing their desire to continue that process of reconciliation, not only between their two countries but also around Europe and the world.\n\n\u201cWe see \\[the need for\\] this especially in the context of the war being waged by Russia against Ukraine,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are convinced that Europe must stand united against violence. Practical solidarity with the victims of aggression and compassion for all victims of war are essential.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, when signs of fatigue are visible everywhere\u2026we encourage our countries to take every possible action to ensure the survival of the Ukrainian people in this war, to end their suffering, and to contribute to the defence of fundamental values, such as life in freedom and dignity,\u201d added the bishops.\n\nIn their statement, the church leaders also noted that \u201ctensions still exist between our societies\u201d over historical issues. They called for such matters to \u201cbe discussed in a way that fosters reconciliation rather than leads to reopening wounds\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is not primarily about being right, but rather about understanding one\u2019s neighbour and approaching the wrongs inflicted on others with empathy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe process of reconciliation includes\u2026a commitment to understanding, a sincere and truthful look at history, and a willingness to shape the future together.\u201d\n\nThe bishops noted that \u201csome political actors continue to attempt to exploit painful and historically unresolved issues for political gain\u201d. Such \u201cpolitical games based on historical wrongs are contrary to the spirit of reconciliation\u201d.\n\nTheir joint statement comes at a moment of increased recent tensions between Poland and Germany, including over historical issues.\n\nThis week, the latest version of a regular study, the\u00a0*Polish-German Barometer*,\u00a0[showed](\u00a0that the proportion of Poles who say they dislike Germans has risen to its highest level in 25 years, while those who say they like Germans has dramatically declined in the last three years.\n\nAmong the most contentious issues is the question of war reparations, with Poland\u2019s former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government\u00a0[launching a claim in 2022](\u00a0for $1.3 trillion in compensation from Germany. In response, Berlin maintained its long-standing position that the issue has already been\u00a0[legally settled](\n\nPoland\u2019s current, more liberal government has refrained from pursuing the reparations claim. But recently elected right-wing President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with PiS,\u00a0[renewed the demand](\u00a0during his first state visit to Berlin in September.\n\nLast week, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Warsaw stirred anger in Poland by\u00a0[declaring](\u00a0that PiS\u2019s reparations claims stoke \u201cdivisions that help only Putin\u201d. Earlier this month, one of the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)\u00a0[claimed](\u00a0that Poland is as much of a threat to his country as Russia is.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/21/polish-and-german-bishops-urge-europe-to-stand-united-in-face-of-russias-war-in-ukraine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudanese army advances in Kordofan amid ongoing clashes with RSF", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/sudanese-army-advances-in-kordofan-amid-ongoing-clashes-with-rsf/3750916", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
