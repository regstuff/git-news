Those are serious issues that need to be reformed cross academia, but there are some pretty major issues in archaeology (and probably in other fields of academia but I\u2019m only discussing things as they relate to archaeology) that don\u2019t get a lot of attention and require fixing. The gut punch here is that many archaeologists just aren\u2019t proficient.\n\nStarting out strong is issue #1: the lack of central organization. There doesn\u2019t need to be a one central archaeology committee, but the lack of central indexing mechanisms for research, even if divided by specializations, is preposterous. An immense amount of labor is often required just researching the existence of sources (unless your research never veers from generalized study). So much research is conducted, and then basically \u2018lost\u2019 because it isn\u2019t subsequently discussed in mainstream currents, and so there are little to no sources to direct researchers to it. If archaeologists came up with centralized databases (even if done independently by specializations), we could cut our own workload down tremendously, and also increase the productivity of research. It is the job of archaeologists to do these things! Archaeologists create the study of archaeology. Schools may teach archaeology, we may publish in journals, but at the end of the day, we are responsible for the creation and development of this field. We need to be organizing ourselves to do so (yes I\u2019m working on a project to do something like this, I\u2019m not hypocritical). With many specializations, it\u2019s like ok there are 30 primary people who are involved with the study of this specialization at the moment, can we not organize via a group email? \n\nIssue #2. The creation of \u2018shelf wasting\u2019 research, or incomplete research. So many publications are just pointlessly repetitive about topics or locations. Researchers will often publish a new book about a location or topic that basically just regurgitates the last publication on it, maybe adding a few new points (losing others). The lack of authoritative publications is also problematic, because why are there 30 (book not paper) publications about x location, if none of them are authoritative and complete (even taking into account only what was available at time of original publication)? Research often ignores any compulsion to take a complete comprehensive account of things. The amount of excavation books or series (again not papers) I\u2019ve looked at with 30 plus pages of drawings of pottery shards but only a one or two line mention of \u2018well preserved frescoes in a majority of rooms\u2019 is absolutely ridiculous! Also research will often not include site plans, or only half complete site plans. And\u2026 I\u2019m so tired of the context of finds not being reported: \u2018column from a room in the north wing\u2019\u2026 what fucking room?? I\u2019ve also seen so much new research that is actually pointless, like restorations of entire structures or decorative schemes, based off fragmentary bits found in a new dig. And yet, with many structures previously dug up (even say last year), there may have been significant finds dug up, but the reporting of the site was incomplete (like just mentioning the existence of frescoes) and the finds are already decaying without records of the original condition. If you need to publish research, instead of reconstructing an entire wall off 2-6 square inches of fragments at some new site, why not reconstruct the decaying but still existent full wall at another site (its next to your university anyway!). \n\nIssue #3: Just being bad at your job. Like not even doing whatever it is you\u2019re doing right. I\u2019m so tired of seeing prominent researchers, in articles published in prominent journals, not citing their sources. If it\u2019s general information, ok I can get it if\nyou don\u2019t want to cite it, but the issue is not citing sources for specific non-general information. \u2018The Roman emperors had a palace on the palatine\u2019 = ok that\u2019s fine if there\u2019s no source this is generally prove-able. \u2018A cup like this one was discovered in a domus on the palatine\u2019 = you\u2019re gonna need to cite the source. I\u2019m so tired of the sources of figures not being cited!!!!! That 19th century drawing you just dropped, where the fuck is it from??? Also the amount of times I\u2019ve seen figures that don\u2019t make sense is ridiculous. Entire collages where the caption is trying to label individual images, \u2018upper right middle right left is of ___\u2019; or figures that will be captioned \u2018location of find labeled with __\u2019 but there is no label, or \u2018series of rooms discovered underneath ___\u2019 but no plan with situation or context shown.\n\nIssue #4: Info hidden behind paywalls. Pretty much all academic publishers are predatory, though granted only some are completely fraudulent. But many journals are run by committees of academics who publish by choice with academic publishers putting up paywalls on everything. It\u2019s the digital age people, you can just take your journal open access (like some journals have done, including recently those journals published by the german archaeological institute DAI). You\u2019re not paying peer reviewers or authors, any income devised from this scheme goes to the publishers as profit. So just publish open access.\n\nI could go on about these issues. But the problem is that many archaeologists actively feed into these problems. It\u2019s kinda an ethical issue for me that many archaeologists get public funds for their digs (ok yes under-funding is an issue, but you\u2019re still getting public funding either directly from the government for certain digs or indirectly through your institution) but then can publish the results of their publicly funded digs trapped behind paywalls. Archaeologists are basically just enabling education-minded corporations. Going back to an earlier point, we create this field!! A lot of blame gets shuffled off to institutions, but we literally can stop being complicit and start working together any day! So why do I think many archaeologists need to have their jobs reconsidered? Well, if you\u2019re enabling private corporations to monetize and control research, to the detriment of everyone involved in that field of research and the general public, and if even when given the chance to conduct research under your own authority you fail to do it in a proficient way (see notes about incomplete or sloppy or repetitive work above), then maybe it\u2019s time your work in this field came to an end. Sure you can like archaeology, but you actually need to be proficient and productive at it.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1foi4wt/archaeology_needs_to_be_reformed_many_need_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel Deliberately Blocked Humanitarian Aid to Gaza, Two Government Bodies Concluded.

I was very impressed with the performance of unsloth! Thanks for the great work. I have a few questions that I could not find answers from past Q/As in this channel and hope the unsloth authors and community can point me to something.\n\nQ1: I have a machine with multiple GPUs. It seems that unsloth always uses the first one (#0). I knew the free version of unsloth is only for single GPU. But can it be \"configured\" to use any free GPU on system (while still in single GPU mode), which will greatly increase my training efficiency. \n\nQ2: I have been experimenting with adjusting some LoRA parameters and found that, if I load a pre-finetuned model for re-training, and its LoRA parameters were not matching my current ones, the load would fail complaining about LoRA mismatch. How can I change the notebook to allow loading such a mismatching one and proceed on using a different set of parameters for further training?\n\nQ3: If I have a base dataset, and an additional \"refined-but-much-smaller\" addon dataset (ratio 100:1) whose purpose is to stress on certain topics not so stressed in the base dataset, what's best strategy to finetune a base model with these? I tried combine both into one dataset (say 600 steps), or train with base dataset first (say 500 steps), then re-train on the model produced by step 1 with the addon dataset only (say 25 steps). I seem to observe the latter produced better result - my observation was simply based on a few \"human-eval\" questions related to the addon dataset. I do not have a good way to judge, but wanted to ask if there are some general guidance. Can I do this with additional small addon special datasets and expected ever improving results?\n\nQ4: The current default map\\_seq\\_length is 2048 (for input), and max\\_new\\_tokens is 512 (for output). If I need to enlarge them, what's the impact on training speed or memory? I could just do my test but just hope someone has already done this and give me some info.\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1fom15z/could_unsloth_run_with_any_gpu_not_fixed_to_gpu_0/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel is gambling Hezbollah will crumple but it faces a well-armed, angry enemy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pg1qpxxzo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China-India ties have enjoyed \"momentum of improvement\" since beginning of this year: Chinese envoy Xu Feihong", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/china-india-ties-have-enjoyed-momentum-of-improvement-since-beginning-of-this-year-chinese-envoy-xu-feihong20240924233816/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "6,000-year-old shaped child skull found at Yass\u0131h\u00f6y\u00fck\n", "summary": "", "link": "https://anatolianarchaeology.net/6000-year-old-shaped-child-skull-found-at-yassihoyuk/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MOD Approved: Is anyone able to provide identification for this glass fragment?
