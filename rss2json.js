The event will take place on May 3\u20134, 2025.\n\n[\u00a0\n\n**Submission deadline: February 23, 2025**\n\nThe focus of NLP4DH is on applying natural language processing techniques to digital humanities research. The topics can be anything of digital humanities interest with a natural language processing or generation aspect. \n\n**Main Track**\n\nA list of suitable NLP4DH topics include but are not limited to:\n\n* Text analysis and processing related to humanities using computational methods\n* Dataset creation and curation for NLP (e.g. digitization, digitalization, datafication, and data preservation).\n* Research on cultural heritage collections such as national archives and libraries using NLP\n* NLP for error detection, correction, normalization and denoising data\n* Generation and analysis of literary works such as poetry and novels\n* Analysis and detection of text genres\n\n**Special Track: Understanding LLMs through humanities**\n\nAs we established in the previous edition of NLP4DH, humanities research has a new role in interpreting and explaining the behavior of LLMs. Reporting numerical results on some benchmarks is not quite enough, we need humanities research to better understand LLMs. This line of research is emerging and we know that it may take several shapes and forms. Here is some list of examples of what this could mean.\n\n* Using theories to analyze or qualitatively evaluate LLMs\n* Using insights from humanities to improve LLMs\n* Using theories to probe LLMs\n* Examining LLMs through linguistic typology and variation\n* The influence of literary theories on understanding LLM-generated text\n* Philosophical inquiries into the \"understanding\" of language in LLMs\n* Analyzing LLM responses using narratology frameworks\n* Cognitive models of human language acquisition vs. LLM training paradigms\n\n**Submission format**\n\n**Short papers** can be up to 4 pages in length. Short papers can report on work in progress or a more targeted contribution such as software or partial results.\n\n**Long papers** can be up to 8 pages in length. Long papers should report on previously unpublished, completed, original work.\n\n**Lightning talks** can be submitted as 750-word abstracts. Lightning talks are suited for discussing ideas or presenting work in progress. Lightning talks will be published in lightning proceedings on Zenodo.\n\nAccepted papers (short and long) will be published in the proceedings that will appear in the ACL Anthology. Accepted papers will also be given an additional page to address the reviewers\u2019 comments. The length of a camera ready submission can then be 5 pages for a short paper and 9 for a long paper with an unlimited number of pages for references.\n\nThe authors of the accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to [a special issue in the Journal of Data Mining &amp; Digital Humanities](\n\n**Important dates**\n\n* Direct paper submission (long and short): February 23, 2025\n* Notification of acceptance: March 10, 2025\n* Camera ready deadline: March 23, 2025\n* Conference: May 3-4, 2025", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1igkb4k/cfp_natural_language_processing_for_digital/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Activist Zahack Tanvir arrested in Saudi Arabia for anti-Pakistan posts released, thanks India \u2013 ThePrint \u2013 Select", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/diplomacy/activist-zahack-tanvir-arrested-in-saudi-arabia-for-anti-pakistan-posts-released-thanks-india/2477535/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Created AI agent that automates AI news curation and post to Instagram", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/ranahaani/autogram", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeology News is back!
