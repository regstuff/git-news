He was a retired professor and a bit of a hoarder, and when we went through the house to clean it up and get it ready to sell, we found a whole bedroom crammed full of archaeology stuff, probably from his old fieldwork back in the 60s. There are boxes and boxes of things like soil samples and fragments of pottery. His old maps and drawings and records cataloguing all the stuff also appear to be here too.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what should be done with all this stuff? His fieldwork was in Italy, so I'm assuming all this stuff is actually from there and wondering if this is something we'd need to contact the Italian government over.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ezq140/found_artifacts_and_records_in_late_professors/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Neolithic engineers used scientific knowledge to build huge megalith", "summary": "A monument in southern Spain that dates to between 3600 and 3800 BC appears to have been built with an understanding of geology and physics.", "link": "https://www.scihb.com/2024/08/neolithic-engineers-used-scientific.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Oregon researchers paint wind turbines partly black to reduce bird deaths \u2022 Oregon Capital Chronicle", "summary": "", "link": "https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/briefs/oregon-researchers-paint-wind-turbines-partly-black-to-reduce-bird-deaths/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In a Likely Overture to China, Nepal Lifts Ban on TikTok", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/asia/nepal-tiktok-china.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Viking Age stone figurine unearthed in Iceland \u2014 but no one can agree on which animal it is", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/vikings/viking-age-stone-figurine-unearthed-in-iceland-but-no-one-can-agree-on-which-animal-it-is", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin on Kursk failure: Not my fault", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-kursk-russia-invasion-war-in-ukraine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine ratifies the statute for joining the International Criminal Court", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.africanews.com/2024/08/22/ukraine-ratifies-the-statute-for-joining-the-international-criminal-court/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India and US ink crucial defence pact to address unanticipated supply chain disruptions", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/india-and-us-ink-crucial-defence-pact-to-address-unanticipated-supply-chain-disruptions-12804730.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Marc Guiu produces early contender for worst miss of the season in Chelsea\u2019s Conference League victory over Servette", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Marc Guiu produces early contender for worst miss of the season in Chelsea\u2019s Conference League victory over Servette</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOUFRGRGtXSFVnQ1RWRS1TdW91VktseC10QmVQRW9yc1ZZVnZfSFJOYkNwaWh1QjFJYmpsTEJjQnF0NlEtaVM3TWhzSUo0dFBrT0tLdXE4eUNrUzVKU0pTc1BiS1c1bDdTb1FRd1U3VkNGaVRpaGJ0aGozWEJ5dFJscHpNVGFkTjJRNERNLV9kaWzSAYIBQVVfeXFMTWRCbmdNdlR3UDN3cVkyeF9IVUFMU09fLVdLdzRfZC1haU1kUnRHU2NKcXBVdDhSVWI0Ykd2dUQyenlFMmdLbldjSDY4bXBHMUZMOHY0SERNZUc5UUZXNFVnVm9oUXJ4WXpBZ21ON3ZKR1RBeFpZRTBwMTlGS29ZUW5HZw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-23", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Chicago Bears\u2019 Douglas Coleman III released from hospital and returning to Chicago after frightening on-field injury", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Bears\u2019 Douglas Coleman III released from hospital and returning to Chicago after frightening on-field injury</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQX1VUYkZDbVR0Z3F4SWdpU19qWnR6YUFJdUo1OGxQNl9xTVpXVS1TR3drc254WWZ2a2txeFVSckZOMTQ1UVpFY081OHVEMkRBRENMT0NhcFpTOXo1Z2k4Y191UWJMVk8tclgtXy1jMXExMi1yRTFzSGhxYklWVVlLN2VTc3U4bUw4dG9BNkY0QmlmWkgwamNkUlFSaHhuZ9IBjwFBVV95cUxQVzdWMkNMZS1NY2dhQ0tIV05XQlRDVTVWa3VJLVlfMk50dFZmVVQ3aDZvQUpTTGRXTXNubnZDM2gxQnZkRW5ITUVmVGJGRTJFY1ozNk15bnA3M1pfLUpLOHdRSlRIWHVleE83MzBrMGIyOHFCcFlSQWJoLTNwUFNZZXk0OXZ6aG5BYnpDSGZCMA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-23", "author": "None"}]}}};
