Every rescue made the project more useful, and the stars followed naturally.\n\n---\n\n### Why I\u2019m sharing this here\n\nThis repo is the reason I broke through the cold start. It\u2019s MIT, text-only, and free to copy or remix. Inside you\u2019ll also see TXTOS, a plain-text OS I built to boost memory and stability when running LLMs \u2014 it\u2019s been another piece people found surprisingly useful.\n\nI thought some of you might find it cool (or helpful) to see how focusing on pain point mapping can drive growth for an open source project.\n\nWould love any feedback \u2014 or if you\u2019ve run into recurring bugs in your own pipelines, I can fold them into the map so the next dev doesn\u2019t hit the same wall.\n\nThanks for reading,\nPS BigBig", "link": "https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Denmark issues first apology over forced contraception of Greenlandic women", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/denmark-pm-apologises-over-physical-and-psychological-harm-caused-by-iud-scandal", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PasteVault: I built a open-source, sleek, zero-knowledge pastebin with a VS Code-like editor in the browser.", "summary": "Hey everyone,\n\n\nI've always wanted a version of privatevin that had a more powerful editor, especially for sharing code snippets and Markdown notes.
