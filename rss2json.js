Bueno ser\u00e9 corto y breve, El pap\u00e1 de mi pap\u00e1 (mi abuelo) gener\u00f3 una riqueza inmensa, abrumadora. Con bienes por toda la rep\u00fablica. \u00c9l tuvo varios matrimonios en uno de ellos naci\u00f3 mi padre y su hermano (ya difunto) en otros matrimonios tuvo a otros 3 hijos. En total 5 de los cuales 2 son de un matrimonio y 3 de otro. Mi padre y su hermano siempre crecieron alejados de \u00e9l, lo ve\u00edan no muy seguido y los otros 3 m\u00e1s de lo mismo. Todos los hermanos crecieron y emprendieron sus caminos. En uno de esos caminos mi padre logr\u00f3 ser el mas existoso de los 5 por lo cual mi abuelo se acerc\u00f3 m\u00e1s a \u00e9l y le propuso fundar una empresa con planta de producci\u00f3n, la cual sus hermanastros no pudieron soportar la envidia y un d\u00eda por la noche incendiaron la empresa la cual fue dada como inexplicable pero se sab\u00eda que ellos hab\u00edan sido y mi abuelo nunca respondi\u00f3 cuando se quem\u00f3 la empresa. Pasaron los a\u00f1os y mi padre segu\u00eda asesorando a las empresas de mi abuelo e \u00edbamos a una casa de campo gigante que ten\u00eda el. La cual un d\u00eda de pronto llegamos nosotros y uno de los hermanastros hab\u00eda estado la semana anterior el cual con tal de hacernos sentir inc\u00f3modos quem\u00f3 los colchones de algunas camas y se fue. Pas\u00f3 1 a\u00f1o de eso y un d\u00eda mi abuelo llama a mi padre que hab\u00eda tenido un accidente y que lo tendr\u00edan que operar el cual mi padre preocupado llega al hospital y mi abuelo entre mentiras le dijo que el carro se hab\u00eda ido para atr\u00e1s y que le hab\u00eda aplastado la pierna la cual ten\u00edan que operar. Luego a la semana mi padre lo lleg\u00f3 a visitar nuevamente y le cont\u00f3 que uno de sus hermanastros por \u201caccidente\u201d hab\u00eda pisado el acelerador y lo atropell\u00f3 (ya la cosa pintaba raro). Al mes aproximadamente mi padre volvi\u00f3 a visitar a mi abuelo el cual parec\u00eda estar extra\u00f1o ya que no se ve\u00eda igual pero nada grave solo notaba como que mi abuelo empezaba a perder la memoria y a olvidarse de peque\u00f1os detalles para luego recordarse. Luego en las vacaciones de ese a\u00f1o ten\u00edamos planeado ir a la casa de campo a la cual cuando est\u00e1bamos ah\u00ed de pronto apareci\u00f3 mi abuelo como cosa extremadamente rara ya que de su casa a la casa de campo era un recorrido de aproximadamente 4-5 horas, el cual su respuesta a su visita fue porque nos quer\u00eda ver ah\u00ed a lo que a mi pap\u00e1 le pareci\u00f3 extremadamente raro ya que \u00e9l nunca nos hab\u00eda ido a visitar a la casa de campo. Y cuando lleg\u00f3 a visitarnos ya se notaba entre tantos su mirada perdida y se le olvidaban m\u00e1s los detalles. Al retirarnos esa vez, a la semana, a mi padre le llega el mensaje de un hermanastro el mismo que tiempo atr\u00e1s hab\u00eda atropellado \u201caccidentalmente\u201d a mi abuelo el cual dec\u00eda: \u201cya no puedes ingresar a la casa de campo t\u00fa ni tus hijos son \u00f3rdenes de mi padre (mi abuelo)\u201d lo cual era mentira ya que mi abuelo jam\u00e1s le neg\u00f3 nada a mi padre y nunca se lo iba a negar. Por lo que mi padre se alert\u00f3 pero dej\u00f3 todo como un punto de envidia y enojo, como siempre hab\u00eda sido. Luego pas\u00f3 el tiempo y mi padre se distanci\u00f3 un poco de mi abuelo debido a los problemas que ten\u00eda personales. Para que despu\u00e9s de un tiempo, el contador de mi abuelo llama a mi padre para contarle que estaba internado en un asilo ya que mi abuelo estaba perdiendo la memoria. Cosa que fue muy rara ya que mi abuelo nunca padeci\u00f3 con problemas de la cabeza. Entonces lo fue a visitar a este asilo y en efecto mi abuelo hab\u00eda empezado a perder la cordura poco pero empezaba a repetir las cosas y se olvidaba de algunas. Tenia varios momentos de lucidez y varios momentos la perd\u00eda. Entonces mi pap\u00e1 preocupado le pregunta a una enfermera que hab\u00eda pasado porque hab\u00eda comenzado a perder la memoria a lo que la enfermera contest\u00f3: \u201cla esposa de su hermanastro (el que lo atropell\u00f3) trajo ex\u00e1menes donde indican que posee Alzheimer\u201d ah\u00ed fue donde todo cobr\u00f3 sentido pero en ese momento era inevitable ya que no se ten\u00eda pruebas de que la esposa del hermanastro (graduada de qu\u00edmica farmac\u00e9utica) hab\u00eda inducido a mi abuelo a que perdiera la memoria con tal de quedarse la herencia. A lo que mi abuelo en ese tiempo que estuvo en este primer asilo obtuvo lucidez por varias noches tal as\u00ed que logr\u00f3 planear un escape de este asilo y lo logr\u00f3. Pero lo atraparon cuando logr\u00f3 regresar a su casa adivinen quien (el hermanastro) luego tomaron la decisi\u00f3n de internarlo en un asilo totalmente intensivo con cuidado las 24h en donde terminaron de ejecutar su plan. Han pasado los a\u00f1os y mi abuelo creo que ya va por la 3-4 fase de Alzheimer en donde ya se les olvida como comer tragar y respirar. Hace poco mi padre lo lleg\u00f3 a ver no lo reconoci\u00f3 hasta despu\u00e9s de un tiempo que estuvo con \u00e9l y lo \u00faltimo que le dijo fue \u201cperd\u00f3n\u201d. Luego a la semana mi padre recibi\u00f3 una llamada del contador de mi abuelo el cual le dec\u00eda entre varias cosas como que mi padre era el hijo del cual mi abuelo estaba m\u00e1s orgulloso y que temia por su vida ya que \u00e9l era el \u00fanico que sab\u00eda d\u00f3nde estaba el testamento de la herencia y que su hermanastro con ayuda de \u00e9l otro hermanastro tambi\u00e9n avaricioso estaban buscando desvivirlo para poder tener control de ese testamento y poder hacerse con las suyas de toda esta fortuna. Pas\u00f3 un poco el tiempo y advinen qu\u00e9 efectivamente el se\u00f1or apareci\u00f3 muerto un d\u00eda. Pero lo que nos dice que no tuvieron \u00e9xito en acceder al testamento ni a la firma de mi abuelo es la casa que mi abuelo ten\u00eda un d\u00eda en marketplace apareci\u00f3 en renta mas no en venta. Y la casa de campo y los otros inmuebles siguen a nombre de mi abuelo. Ahora mi pregunta es para todos los abogados que podr\u00eda hacer mi padre para abogar por esa herencia suponiendo que en un caso si exista un testamento y en caso de que no que pasar\u00eda y \u00e9l podr\u00eda abogar por el 100% de la herencia sabiendo esto.
