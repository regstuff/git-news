While this is technically correct, I want spaCy to recognize that 'walk' in the context of that sentence is actually a verb in the wrong form, rather than a noun. I fully understand that spaCy's tagger and parser are trained on grammatical sentences, which is why 'walk' is seen as a noun \n\nAnother example: 'Zuko is known for betray his uncle', the word 'for' is seen as a subordinating conjunction, but it is actually used as an adposition, except the verb following it is in the wrong form.\n\nI have a project that requires me to use the dependency tree of a sentence as well as its part of speech tags, but I also need to be able to work with ungrammatical sentences.\n\nMy initial intuition is that I can achieve this by training the part of speech tagger on ungrammatical sentences, however I am wondering if it makes more sense to train the parser on ungrammatical sentences rather than the tagger... or maybe both?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1bu1wur/training_a_parsertagger_on_ungrammatical_sentences/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hospitals must obtain written consent for pelvic and similar exams, the federal government says", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/pelvic-exams-consent-federal-government-hhs-52331c180249daa1aa12c470f8d70061", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Korean \"Artificial Sun\" Reactor Sets Record at 100 Million Degrees", "summary": "", "link": "https://futurism.com/the-byte/korean-artificial-sun-fusion-reactor-record-100-million-degrees", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Children injured in Finland school shooting, minor apprehended", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/finland-school-shooting-children-injured-vantaa-helsinki-rcna145973", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan lifts pause in funding for UNRWA, following Canada, Australia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/2/japan-lifts-pause-in-funding-for-unrwa-following-canada-australia", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Namibia heightens poaching alert after 28 rhinos killed ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.algoafm.co.za/domestic/namibia-heightens-poaching-alert-after-28-rhinos-killed", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Center-right leader Lu\u00eds Montenegro sworn in as Portuguese prime minister - Having vowed to not work with the far right, his minority government will need Socialist Party support to pass legislation.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/luis-montenegro-portugal-new-prime-minister-sworn-in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian Foreign Ministry invites banned Taliban delegation to World Islamic Forum in Kazan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-foreign-ministry-invites-banned-143700690.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Former World Series winning Boston Red Sox executive Larry Lucchino dies at 78", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Former World Series winning Boston Red Sox executive Larry Lucchino dies at 78</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMDIvc3BvcnQvYm9zdG9uLXJlZC1zb3gtZXhlY3V0aXZlLWxhcnJ5LWx1Y2NoaW5vLWRpZXMtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-03", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How elite horses travel to one of the world\u2019s biggest racing events", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">How elite horses travel to one of the world\u2019s biggest racing events</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tL3Nwb3J0L2R1YmFpLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1yYWNlaG9yc2UtdHJhdmVsLWhuay1zcGMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-02", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Devin Booker puts up 52 points to lift Phoenix Suns over Los Angeles Clippers", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Devin Booker puts up 52 points to lift Phoenix Suns over Los Angeles Clippers</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMDIvc3BvcnQvZGV2aW4tYm9va2VyLXBob2VuaXgtc3Vucy1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1jbGlwcGVycy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-02", "author": "None"}]}}};
