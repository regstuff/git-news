Right now my stack is pretty simple. I'm using gemini for both transcription of audio from the user and as well as generating the text response (I give it a prompt to transcribe and then respond in text form to the audio). The text response is fed through a text to speech engine. Currently using speechify for that.\n\nThe problem I'm having is latency. When I include audio for gemini to transcribe with my request it shoots up from \\~400ms of latency to \\~1.2s of latency. I then need to feed that to a text to speech engine. Right now the multilingual mode of speechify gives me an extra \\~1.3s of latency. I've tried elevenlabs and I can get around \\~400-600ms of latency, however it's very expensive.\n\nI should clarify when I say latency for each part, I'm using the streaming endpoints of each service and purely talking about the time from when I make the request to the service (eg gemini) to the first chunk that's received from it.
