More details in description", "summary": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have been trying to fine tune mT5 for paraphrasing task. My aim is to fine tune it for the kannada language, which the model is pre trained on. According to mT5 documentation for any specific task the model is supposed to be fine tuned.\n\nThe issue however is when I fine tuned the model on my dataset , the losses are as you'd expect and they converge. But when trying to evaluate by generating , the model tends to repeat the complete input sentence as it is.\n\nNow I would like to explain about how I created the dataset. I used the NLLB model to generate multiple paraphrases using round trip translation for a single sentence using different configurations . For example : sentence A has 5 different paraphrases generated from greedy search , beam search , topK sampling , topP sampling and a combined sampling. My aim was to demonstrate how doing so can potentially increase the data size (25k -&gt; 90k)  which is important for low resource languages such as Kannada. So each sentence has maximum 5 different variations\n\nHowever here is where the issue lies , I cannot train on the complete dataset on a single go due to GPU memory constraints , batch size currently is \"4\" which is small enough to train 30k sentence pairs for 5 epochs. So I tend to train the model once on the 30k sentences , save it and then load it to later train it on another 30k sentences and so on.\n\nAs per my research the model predicting the input sentence can be due to overfiting and reducing the number of epochs may help . After which I trained on first 30k sentence pairs for 2 epochs and indeed it performed better.\n\nI'd like to know if there could be any other reason why this is happening? I'd be glad if anyone is willing to look into my work and review it , I will give the details needed. I am not trying to get \"exact way\" to do it , I don't understand as to why it predicts the input sentence when fine tuned on the augmented dataset as opposed to when I fine tuned it using a dataset which had 25k sentence pairs (different dataset ).\n\nThank you.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1hg4ggr/fine_tuned_paraphrasing_model_leads_to_predicting/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
