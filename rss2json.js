Those also facing \u201chybrid threats and increasing drone incursions\u201d, such as Poland, will receive additional drone and anti-drone support.\n\nFinally, six member states \u2013 Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia and Austria \u2013 were deemed to face a \u201csignificant migratory situation because of the cumulative pressures of the last five years\u201d. They are therefore eligible to apply for full or partial exemptions from providing \u201csolidarity\u201d contributions.\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s classifications still require approval by the European Council, which is made up of the individual member states. They are also subject to review in the summer and autumn of 2026.\n\nThe specific size of the so-called \u201csolidarity pool\u201d \u2013 that is, how many migrants will be relocated or how much money provided to frontline states \u2013 has also not yet been made public, notes Euronews. The size of each country\u2019s solidarity share will also be decided by the end of this year.\n\nNews service Euractiv notes that discussions over implementation of the pact could see a clash between the southern member states that are deemed under migratory pressure and northern member states, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, that accuse the frontline states of failing to uphold EU asylum rules.\n\nDespite the remaining question marks, Poland\u2019s prime minister, Donald Tusk, hailed yesterday\u2019s announcement as a success. Last month, he had already\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that Poland would be exempted from providing solidarity.\n\n\u201cAs I said, Poland will not accept migrants under the migration pact. Nor pay for them,\u201d wrote Tusk on social media on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s already a decision. We act, we don\u2019t \\[just\\] talk!\u201d\n\nThe deputy interior minister in charge of migration affairs, Maciej Duszczyk, also hailed Tuesday\u2019s announcement as a \u201chuge success for the Polish government\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe presence of war refugees from Ukraine and the situation at the border with Belarus have been taken into account \\[by the EU\\],\u201d wrote Duszczyk. \u201cThis in practice means that Poland is exempt from solidarity for many, many years.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, argued that Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201cnothing new\u201d and simply confirmed that \u201cwe are at the mercy of Brussels\u201d, which will issue such migration assessments every year.\n\nPoland was the primary initial destination for refugees fleeing Russia\u2019s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022. Almost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland, the highest number anywhere in the EU apart from Germany.\n\nIn relation to population, Poland also has the EU\u2019s second-highest number of Ukrainian refugees, behind only the Czech Republic.\n\nSince 2021, Poland has also faced a migration crisis on its border with Belarus, where tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers \u2013 mainly from Africa, the Middle East and Asia \u2013 have tried to cross with the encouragement and assistance of the Belarusian authorities.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/12/eu-includes-poland-among-countries-to-be-exempted-from-migrant-relocation/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sharaa: Syria won\u2019t\u00a0enter talks \u2018directly right now\u2019 with Israel on Abraham Accords", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-landmark-meeting-trump-says-syria-will-be-very-successful-country-under-sharaa/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
