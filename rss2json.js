Often, it is hard to tell if a method is better than another or just better tuned. Tuning curves fix this ambiguity by accounting for tuning effort. Specifically, they plot validation performance as a function of the number of hyperparameter choices tried so far. While several estimators exist for these curves, it is common to use point estimates, which we show fail silently and give contradictory results when given too little data. Beyond point estimates, confidence bands are necessary to rigorously establish the relationship between different approaches. We present the first method to construct valid confidence bands for tuning curves. The bands are exact, simultaneous, and distribution-free, thus they provide a robust basis for comparing methods. Empirical analysis shows that while bootstrap confidence bands, which serve as a baseline, fail to approximate their target confidence, ours achieve it exactly. We validate our design with ablations, analyze the effect of sample size, and provide guidance on comparing models with our method. To promote confident comparisons in future work, we release opda: an easy-to-use library that you can install with pip.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cb4iem/show_your_work_with_confidence_confidence_bands/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "African tech companies are ditching Google for a small Indian competitor", "summary": "", "link": "https://restofworld.org/2024/zoho-google-workspace-alternative-africa/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "With BrahMos missile delivery to Philippines, India sets out its arms stall for Southeast Asia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3259900/brahmos-missile-delivery-philippines-india-sets-out-its-arms-stall-southeast-asia", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In 1913, 10-year-old Sarah Rector received a land allotment of 160 acres in Oklahoma.

I have not been hiking or camping since I was a child and I am completely lost in picking out what I should get/ what brands are best or will hold up the greatest. We will be camping out in the desert with temperatures typically ranging from 70's-80's Fahrenheit during the day however as it is the desert it could get up to 90s/100. I am also prone to overheating so I would like to find sturdy pants that won't tear but will also not make me feel like I'm burning alive.

I am training Mixtral (qlora) to generate a JSON output that translates a questionnaire into a structured logic.

My arguments for and against doing so are purely theoretical and I'm hoping someone can tell me if one of them is more valid to decide if it's worth exploring (I've got 100 other ideas)\n\nPro:\n\nThe model won't spend its \"effort\" learning the output structure while it's learning the more limited training data.\n\nCon:\n\nThe model could fall into a local minimum from overly focusing on the output. Also, not sure if I will accidentally embed patterns or noise in the logic output by randomly generating it. Maybe I could just train on the actual outputs that I have without the context?
