Agentic behavior vs. standard API\n\nWhen I use **Claude Desktop**, it seems to handle quite complex system prompts.  \nFor example, if I ask it to *research a company* \u2014 get basic info, LinkedIn profile, geo coordinates, etc. \u2014 Claude goes into an \u201cagentic loop\u201d and sequentially performs multiple searches or steps to gather everything.\n\nHowever, when I use the **Sonnet 4.5 API** with web search in OpenWebUI, it only makes *one* search call and lists whatever it finds \u2014 it doesn\u2019t perform deeper, sequential web searches.\n\nI was considering trying the **Claude Agent SDK** to replicate that looping behavior, but I haven\u2019t found any examples or documentation on how to integrate it with OpenWebUI. Am I missing something here, or is nobody else doing this (which is usually a bad sign \ud83d\ude05)?\n\n\n\n# 2. Designing simple team workflows\n\nI want to make workflows easy for my team.  \nFor example: when a new customer needs to be added, they should just type in the company name, and the AI should automatically research all relevant info and push the structured dataset into our database through an API.\n\nHow would you organize something like this in OpenWebUI \u2014 via **folders**, **workspaces**, or some other setup?\n\n\n\n# 3. Pipes vs. Functions\n\nI\u2019m still a bit confused about the conceptual difference between **pipes** and **functions**.  \nCan someone explain how these are meant to be used differently?\n\n\n\n# 4.

Incremental ASR: Partial transcripts arrive quickly, but deciding when to commit text vs keep buffering is tricky . A pause of even half a second can throw off the turn-taking rhythm .\n2. Repair phenomena: Disfluencies like \u201cuh\u201d or mid-sentence restarts confuse the agent unless explicitly filtered. I added a lightweight post-processor to ignore fillers, which improved flow .\n3. Context tracking: When users abruptly switch topics, the model struggles. I tried layering in a simple dialogue state tracker to reset context, which helped keep it from spiraling .\n4. Graceful fallback: The most natural conversations weren\u2019t the ones where the agent nailed every response, but the ones where it \u201cfailed politely\u201d e.g., acknowledging confusion and nudging the user back .\n\nCurious if others here have tackled incremental processing or repair strategies for spoken dialogue systems.

However, the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party claim that credit should go to the recently elected PiS-aligned president, Karol Nawrocki.\n\n\n\nThe EU Pact on Migration and Asylum was adopted last year \u2013\u00a0[despite opposition from Poland](\u00a0\u2013 and will go into force over the following two years. One element is a so-called \u201csolidarity framework\u201d that requires other member states to help those receiving large numbers of migrants.\n\nThey can do so by taking in a share of those migrants or by paying \u20ac20,000 for each they do not take. Poland has argued that it would be unfair if it were expected to do this because it welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, and still houses almost a million of them.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Polish broadcaster RMF reported unofficially that the European Commission has agreed to exempt Poland from the solidarity mechanism due to its support for Ukrainian refugees. Another media outlet, Polsat News, reported the same based on its sources.\n\nPoland would be recognised as a country \u201cunder migratory pressure\u201d and therefore eligible for support, rather than being expected to help others. Two years ago, that is precisely what the then European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson,\u00a0[said was likely to happen](\n\n\n\nRMF reported that the European Commission would next week announce which countries it wanted to define as being under migratory pressure, with that list then needing approval from the Council of the European Union, which is made up of government ministers from each member state.\n\nHowever, the Polish Press Agency (PAP) reported based on its own sources that the commission has not yet reached a final decision on how to classify Poland.\n\nLate on Saturday morning, Polish government spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka appeared to confirm RMF\u2019s report, writing on social media: \u201cThe tough and uncompromising stance of Donald Tusk\u2019s government on the migration pact is yielding results\u201d.\n\nIn the afternoon, Tusk himself wrote: \u201cI said that there would be no relocation of migrants in Poland, and there won\u2019t be! It\u2019s done.\u201d Earlier this year, Tusk had warned the EU that\u00a0[Poland would not comply with the migration pact](\u00a0if it involved receiving relocated migrants.\n\n\n\nFigures from PiS \u2013 which ruled Poland from 2015 to 2023 and is now the main opposition party \u2013 claimed that President Nawrocki, who was elected this year with support from PiS, is to thank for the European Commission\u2019s reported decision.\n\nOn Thursday this week, Nawrocki\u2019s office sent a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen informing her that \u201cPoland will not agree to any actions by European institutions aimed at relocating illegal migrants to Poland\u201d.\n\n\u201cLook what happened,\u201d said former PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki today, quoted by news website Interia. \u201cA few days ago, President Nawrocki sent a tough letter to von der Leyen\u2026 A few days pass, and the EU is cracking. It\u2019s cracking before Karol! Thank you, Mr President.\u201d\n\nAnother former PiS prime minister, Beata Szyd\u0142o, noted that today\u2019s news came just as PiS was about to hold a mass anti-immigration protest in Warsaw. \u201cThey \\[the EU\\] got scared by the anger of Poles,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, commission spokesman Markus Lammert confirmed that they had received Nawrocki\u2019s letter. \u201cPoland is showing extraordinary solidarity with Ukraine and has accepted a large number of Ukrainian refugees for over three years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a huge effort, which we fully take into account.\u201d\n\nLammert also noted that Poland faces a\u00a0[situation on its border with Belarus]( \u201cwhere migration is being used as a weapon\u201d. Since 2021, Belarus has been encouraging and assisting tens of thousands of migrants to irregularly cross into the EU over its borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.\n\n\u201cThe commission fully supports Poland, both politically and through additional financial support for border protection,\u201d he declared, quoted by Business Insider Polska.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/10/11/poland-says-it-will-be-exempted-from-eu-migrant-relocations/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What are your favorite underrepresented historical eras in media?", "summary": "", "link": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1nv0u1c/what_are_your_favorite_underrepresented/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
