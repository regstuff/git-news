Most of that time isn't actually editing the prompts, but it's running evals, debugging incorrect runs, patching the prompts, and re-running those evals. Over and over and over again.\n\nIt's super tedious and honestly very frustrating, but I wanted to share a few things I've learned.\n\n# Use ChatGPT to Iterate\n\nI wouldn't even bother writing the first few prompts yourself. Copy the markdown from the [OpenAI Prompting Guide]( paste it into chatgpt and describe what you're trying to do, what inputs you have, and what outputs you want and use that as your first attempt. I've created a dedicated project at this point, and edit my prompts heavily in it.\n\n# Break up the prompt into smaller steps\n\nLLMs generally don't perform that well when trying to do too many steps. I'm building a self-healing browser agent and my first prompt was trying to analyze the history of browser actions, try to figure out what was wrong, output the correct action to recover on and categorize the type of error. It was too much. Here's that first version:\n\n        You are an expert in error analysis.\n        \n        You are given an error message, a screenshot of a website, and other relevant information.\n        Your task is to analyze the error and provide a detailed analysis of the error. The error message given to you might be incorrect. You need to determine if the error message is correct or not.\n        You will be given a list of possible error categories. Choose the most likely error category or create a new one if it doesn't exist.\n        \n        Here is the list of possible error categories:\n        \n        {error_categories}\n        \n        Here is the error message:\n        \n        {error_message}\n        \n        Here is the other relevant information:\n        \n        {other_relevant_information}\n        \n        Here is the output json data model:\n        \n        {output_data_model}\n\nNow I have around 7 different prompts that tackle each step of my process. Latency does go up, but accuracy and reliablity increase dramatically.\n\n# Move Deterministic Tasks out of your prompt\n\nMight seem obvious, but aggresively remove things that can be done in code out of your prompt. For me, it was things like XPath evaluations and creating a heuristic for finding the failure point in the browser agent's history.\n\n# Try Different LLM Providers\n\nWe switched to Azure because we had a bunch of credits, but it turned out to be 2x improvement in latency. I would experiment with the major llms (claude, gemini, azure's models, etc.) and see what works for you in terms of accuracy and latency. Something like LiteLLM can make this easier.\n\n# Context is King\n\nThe quality of inputs is the most important. There are usually two common issues with LLMs. Either the foundational model itself is not working properly or your prompt is lacking something. Usually it's the latter. And the easiest way to test this is by thinking to yourself, \"if I had the same inputs and instructions as the LLM, would I as a human be able to produce the desired output?\" If not, you can iterate on what inputs you need or what instructions you need to add.\n\nThere's a ton more things I can mention but those were the major points.\n\nLet me know what has worked for you!\n\nAlso, here's a bunch of system prompts that were leaked to take inspiration from: [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lzrmzg/a_few_things_ive_learned_about_prompt_engineering/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - pipelight/virshle: Virtual machines from the command line and TOML files.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/pipelight/virshle", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India eyes bigger trade role in Latin America", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dtnext.in/news/chennai/india-latin-america-trade-hq-to-be-set-up-in-chennai-839969", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Our M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res staff are being killed in Gaza.
