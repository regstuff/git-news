The reporting judge, Magid Nauef L\u00e1uar, ruled that the defendant and the victim had a \"consensual affective bond\" and overturned the first-instance sentence that had condemned the suspect to nine years and four months in prison.\n\n\n\nHis vote was supported by the majority of the magistrates of the 9th Criminal Chamber of the Minas Gerais Court of Justice (TJMG). The decision provoked reactions from parliamentarians of different political persuasions, who condemned the defendant's acquittal (read more below).\n\n\n\nThe Penal Code establishes that having sexual intercourse or committing another lewd act with a minor under 14 years of age constitutes statutory rape. The Superior Court of Justice (STJ) has already established that the victim's consent, any prior sexual experience, or the existence of a romantic relationship do not preclude the occurrence of the crime.\n\n\n\nHowever, Judge Magid Nauef L\u00e1uar considered that the case, which occurred in Indian\u00f3polis, in the Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro region, has \"peculiarities\" that allow for the non-automatic application of binding precedents.\n\n\n\n\"The relationship between the accused and the minor did not result from an act of violence, coercion, fraud, or duress, but rather from a consensual affective bond, with the prior consent of the victim's parents and experienced in the presence of all,\" says an excerpt from the decision.\n\n\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office of Minas Gerais (MPMG) stated that it will identify the \"appropriate appeal route\" and adopt the \"appropriate procedural measures.\"\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the case\n\n\n\nThe MPMG filed charges against the suspect in April 2024 for rape of a vulnerable person due to the \"practice of carnal knowledge and lewd acts\" against the victim. The girl's mother was also charged because she allegedly \"failed to act\" despite being aware of the facts.\n\n\n\nAccording to investigations, the teenager was living with the man, with her mother's permission, and had stopped attending school.\n\n\n\nThe suspect, who has a criminal record for crimes such as homicide and drug trafficking, was arrested in the act on April 8, 2024, while with the victim.\n\n\n\nAt the police station, he admitted to having sexual relations with the girl. Her mother stated that she allowed the man to \"date\" her daughter.\n\n\n\nIn November 2025, both were sentenced by the 1st Criminal and Juvenile Court of the Araguari District to nine years and four months in prison.\n\n\n\nThe defendants appealed, and the appeal was reviewed by the 9th Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice of Minas Gerais (TJMG) this month.\n\n\n\nAcquittal\n\n\n\nUpon reviewing the case, the reporting judge, Magid Nauef L\u00e1uar, considered that the victim maintained with the defendant \"a relationship analogous to marriage, a fact that was known to her family.\"\n\n\n\nThe 9th Criminal Chamber of the TJMG (Court of Justice of Minas Gerais), by majority vote, decided to acquit the man and the girl's mother.\n\n\n\nThe MPMG (Public Prosecutor's Office of Minas Gerais) stated, in a note, that it will analyze the decision and take the appropriate procedural measures.\n\n\n\n\"The national legal system and the consolidated jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice \\[...\\] establish the absolute presumption of vulnerability for children and adolescents under 14 years of age. This normative guideline aims to safeguard the healthy development and sexual dignity of this population, treating them as inalienable legal assets, which prevail over any interpretation based on the alleged consent of the victim or family acquiescence,\" said the MPMG.\n\n\n\nThe Public Defender's Office of Minas Gerais, which appealed against the first-instance conviction, stated that it \"acted to guarantee the defendant's right to a full defense\" in compliance with its constitutional duties.\n\n\n\nAccording to the State Secretariat of Justice and Public Security (Sejusp), the suspect left the prison system on February 13, after a release order was granted by the court.\n\n\n\nPolitical Repercussions\n\n\n\nThis Friday (20), federal deputy Duda Salabert (PDT-MG) stated on social media that she would file a complaint against the Brazilian State with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights because of judicial decisions that \"have been relativizing the rape of vulnerable individuals.\"\n\n\n\n\"No child can legally consent to sexual violence. No family can legitimize abuse. Calling violence 'love' does not change the law. This complaint is not against a specific judge. It is against a structural failure of the State, which allows interpretations incompatible with the full protection of childhood,\" she wrote.\n\n\n\nFederal Deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL) said she would denounce the TJMG's decision to the National Council of Justice (CNJ).\n\n\n\n\"It's disgusting that, faced with a 35-year-old man who 'had a relationship' with a 12-year-old girl, the Justice system says there is no crime, but rather 'formation of a family'. There is no family there. There is a pedophile and a victim. And there is no 'relationship'. There is a crime, the rape of an incapacitated person,\" she posted.\n\n\n\nFederal Deputy Nikolas Ferreira (PL) also condemned the acquittal.\n\n\"The law is clear: for minors under 14 years old, any sexual relationship is statutory rape. It doesn't matter if they consented, if they've had other relationships, if they said they like him. The law is objective. \\[...\\] This is literally normalizing abuse,\" he said in a video posted on social media.\n\n\n\nMinistry of Human Rights speaks out\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Human Rights and Citizenship (MDHC) said in a statement that \"Brazil adopts the logic of comprehensive protection of children and adolescents, according to the Federal Constitution and the Statute of the Child and Adolescent (ECA).\"\n\n\n\n\"When the family does not ensure this protection \u2014 especially in cases of sexual violence \u2014 it is up to the State and society, including the three branches of government, to safeguard the rights of the child, and it is not admissible that family consent or self-declaration of marital ties be used to relativize violations,\" the ministry stated.\n\n\n\nThe MDHC also stated that it \"repudiates child marriage, a practice that constitutes a serious violation of human rights and deepens inequalities of gender, race, and class\" and that it \"has made international commitments to eliminate this practice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Judicial decisions, including those within the Courts of Justice, must be aligned with this normative framework, ensuring that no interpretation weakens the comprehensive protection of children and adolescents,\" it added.", "link": "https://g1.globo.com/mg/minas-gerais/noticia/2026/02/20/justica-de-mg-absolve-homem-de-35-anos-acusado-de-estupro-de-vulneravel-contra-menina-de-12.ghtml", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cuba-bound tanker carrying Russian fuel set to test blockade from Washington", "summary": "", "link": "https://energynewsbeat.co/cuba-bound-tanker-carrying-russian-fuels-set-to-test-trumps-blockade/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Handling interruptions in voice AI is an unsolved problem. How are you dealing with it?", "summary": "This is the #1 technical challenge we face running voice AI agents on real phone calls, and I haven\u2019t seen a satisfying solution anywhere.\n \nIn a real phone conversation, people interrupt constantly. They say \u201cmm-hmm\u201d while you\u2019re talking. They start their answer before you finish the question. They cough. Background noise triggers false positives on voice activity detection.\n \nWhat we\u2019ve tried and the results:\n \n\u2022 Simple VAD threshold: If we detect speech while the agent is talking, stop and listen. Problem: too sensitive = agent stops every time someone breathes. Too insensitive = agent talks over the user. We\u2019ve tuned this endlessly and there\u2019s no perfect setting.\n\u2022 Energy-based filtering: Ignore \u201cinterruptions\u201d below a certain energy/volume threshold. Works okay for background noise but fails for soft-spoken users and quiet \u201cmm-hmm\u201d acknowledgments.\n\u2022 Semantic interrupt detection: Run a quick classifier on the partial transcript to determine if the interruption is meaningful (\u201cwait, actually\u201d) vs backchannel (\u201cmm-hmm\u201d, \u201cokay\u201d). This is the best approach but adds latency and still has ~15% error rate in our testing.\n\u2022 Platform-level handling: ElevenLabs has built-in interruption handling that\u2019s decent but not configurable enough.

U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening secondary tariffs on any country that works to help Cuba, so no clear replacement is on the horizon. The tipping point may finally be here.\n\nBut as the Trump administration ratchets up economic pressure against Havana in an effort to secure regime change, the potential human cost of that change is coming into view. International airlines have suspended flights to Cuba after the government announced that it would soon be unable to refuel planes that land at its airports. Blackouts grow longer and longer. So do the food lines at government bodegas in major cities.\n\nWorries are emerging that the intense economic pressure campaign against Cuba could trigger one of the worst humanitarian and migration crises in Latin American history. There are also fears that a protracted standoff could cause a collapse of the Cuban state comparable to what\u2019s occurring in nearby Haiti, where gangs are threatening to take over the country and the weak central government has struggled to quell violence in major cities.\n\n##See also\n\n* [A New U.S. Blockade Is Strangling Cuba \u2022 An analysis of ship movements shows that the Trump administration is isolating the island at one of its most vulnerable moments.](\n* [Cuba\u2019s healthcare system pushed to the brink by U.S. fuel blockade, Cuban minister says \u2022 Experts and some leaders of other countries have warned that the island could be on the verge of a humanitarian crisis.](\n* [No food, no fuel, no tourists: Under US pressure, life in Cuba grinds to a halt](\n* [The sinking of Cuba: \u2018We are a sacrificial altar\u2019 \u2022 The pillars of Castroism, such as healthcare, education, the fight against poverty, and even security, are crumbling in the face of Trump\u2019s latest blows in a society that has lost hope.

Almost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland today, and the government argues that it is time to normalise their status.\n\nAnnouncing his signature on the bill, Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition and regularly clashes with the more liberal ruling coalition, claimed credit for pushing the government towards ending the \u201cunconditional privileges\u201d granted to Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently stood by Ukraine in its fight against imperial Russia,\u201d said the president. \u201cIn the first months of the war, Poland passed the test of solidarity like no other country.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what was justified at the time of difficulty, over time began to breed a sense of inequality towards Polish citizens,\u201d he continued. \u201cI promised to end the era of unconditional privileges. Today, I am fulfilling this commitment.\u201d\n\nThe previous\u00a0[special act](\u00a0on Ukrainian refugees simplified rules on residence, work, benefits and education. However, the government said last month that it now wants to introduced a \u201csingle, coherent support system for all foreigners covered by temporary protection in the EU, regardless of citizenship\u201d.\n\nThe new law, which comes into force on 5 March, extends the legal stay of people fleeing the war and Ukrainian citizens whose residence permits were prolonged because of the conflict, allowing them to apply for legal residence until 4 March 2027.\n\nUnder the new rules, Ukrainian refugees without healthcare insurance will be treated the same as uninsured Polish citizens. There are exceptions for children, pregnant women, victims of violence, and wounded soldiers.\n\nAdditionally, special measures put in place to help Ukrainian children adapt to Polish schools \u2013 such as Polish language classes, preparatory courses and simplified rules for hiring intercultural assistants \u2013 will be removed at the end of the current academic year.\n\nMeanwhile, the provision of accommodation and food will be restricted to particularly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.\n\nThe current right of Ukrainians to establish a business under special rules \u2013 i.e. the same conditions applicable to Polish citizens \u2013 will also be terminated.\n\nThose seeking temporary protection will be required to register for a Polish personal identification number (PESEL) within 30 days of entry. Failure to register will be treated as an implied waiver of temporary protection.\n\nSpeaking after signing the bill on Thursday, Nawrocki said that the new measures mean continued support for Ukrainians but an end to \u201cprivileges at the expense of Poles\u201d.\n\n\u201cAssistance must be coupled with responsibility and contribution to our community,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe are creating fair rules for those who want to work here, while also protecting the Polish labour market and the state budget.\u201d\n\nLast August, shortly after taking office, Nawrocki\u00a0[vetoed](\u00a0an attempt by the government to extend support for Ukrainian refugees on the previous terms. Instead, a\u00a0[different law was introduced](\u00a0in September that made elements of that support conditional.\n\nAt that time, the president made clear it would be the last time he would sign a law extending special support for Ukrainians.

However, in that year, the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government changed the system so that most members were chosen by politicians.\n\nThe move was widely condemned by expert bodies as undermining judicial independence.\u00a0[Polish](\u00a0and\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings have found the KRS to no longer be a legitimate body due to it now being under political influence.\n\nThe current, more liberal government, which replaced PiS in 2023, has pledged to restore the legitimacy of the KRS by again having most members elected by judges. However, a\u00a0[previous attempt](\u00a0to do so was blocked in 2024 by then-President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally.\n\nLast November, justice minister Waldemar \u017burek\u00a0[launched another effort](\u00a0to reform the KRS, which he said was an attempt at \u201ccompromise\u201d as it took into account some of Duda\u2019s concerns but still restored the right of judges to elect most KRS members in direct and secret elections\n\nThe legislation was approved by parliament in January. However, Duda\u2019s successor, Nawrocki, who is also aligned with PiS, has now decided to veto it.\n\nAmong the concerns expressed by Nawrocki\u2019s office are that the law would have ended the role of parliament, which is \u201ca representative of the sovereign, of all Poles\u201d, in choosing members of the KRS.\n\nThe president\u2019s chancellery also said that the proposed law \u201craises serious constitutional and systemic concerns\u201d, including by specifying that KRS candidates have at least ten years of judicial experience and five years in their current position. This \u201carbitrarily excludes a significant group of judges from running\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Nawrocki argued that one element of the legislation would have resulted in doubts over the\u00a0[legal status of around 3,000 judges](\u00a0previously appointed by the KRS and all the rulings issued by them, therefore creating \u201cimmense legal chaos\u201d.\n\nHowever, the government\u2019s spokesman, Adam Sz\u0142apka, responded to Nawrocki\u2019s veto by saying that signing the bill would have been a way \u201cto end the chaos in the courts\u201d caused by PiS\u2019s reforms, which rendered many institutions and appointments illegitimate.\n\nHaving long anticipated Nawrocki\u2019s veto, the ruling coalition does, however, have a \u201cplan B\u201d, which it\u00a0[set in motion last week]( when the speaker of parliament began the process of selecting new members of the KRS for when its current term expires in May.\n\nGiven that the PiS-era law giving parliament the right to choose KRS members remains in place, the ruling coalition plans to use its parliamentary majority to choose candidates democratically nominated by judges themselves.\n\nSince coming to office last August, Nawrocki has vetoed government bills at an\u00a0[unprecedented rate]( Last week, he vetoed bills on\u00a0[regulating crypto-asset markets](\u00a0and\u00a0[recognising Silesian as a regional language](\n\nAlongside today\u2019s veto of the KRS bill, the president also vetoed another bill that the government said was intended to support farmers.\n\nThe president, however, claimed it was \u201ca bad law hiding behind a pretty name\u201d and would in fact have favoured large entities while drowning smaller family farmers in bureaucracy. That would have \u201cthreatened hundreds of thousands of Polish farming families and the country\u2019s food security\u201d, said Nawrocki.\n\nAs reports of Nawrocki\u2019s two latest vetoes \u2013 the 26th and 27th of his term \u2013 emerged, Prime Minister Donald Tusk condemned the president for vetoing \u201cblindly, just to cause harm\u201d rather than to protect Poland\u2019s interests.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/19/president-vetoes-bill-reforming-judicial-body-at-heart-of-polands-rule-of-law-crisis/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ceasefire in eastern DR Congo raises hopes for peace", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/ceasefire-in-eastern-dr-congo-raises-hopes-for-peace/a-76002969", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tr*mp's Board of Peace members pledge $7bn in Gaza relief", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8rke05kv4o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why did this subreddit changed its name to r/anime_titties?", "summary": "It\u2019s not April 1st so I\u2019m wondering about the recent change.
