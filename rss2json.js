However, he had refused to attend, arguing that the body was illegally formed and also citing his treatment for cancer.\n\nDuring a heated, almost eight-hour-long appearance before the commission on Monday, Ziobro confirmed that he had played a key role in the purchase of Pegasus and said he was \u201cproud\u201d of that fact, given that it was used to tackle crime.\n\nThe current government, however, argues that Pegasus was used by PiS to spy on its political opponents and prosecutors believe that its purchase in 2017 was carried out illegally.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the district court in Warsaw ordered that Ziobro be detained and brought before the commission after he had repeatedly failed to comply with earlier summonses.\n\nOn Monday morning, police were pictured arriving at Ziobro\u2019s home to execute the court order. They were seen ringing the doorbell but without any answer.\n\nZiobro himself then announced that he was in Brussels, where he has been recovering from cancer surgery. But he said that he would be returning to Poland on a flight landing in Warsaw around 10 a.m. \u2013 half an hour before his hearing was due to begin.\n\nWhen he landed, police were waiting to detain him, taking Ziobro directly off the plane as it sat on the tarmac. He was seen telling them that their actions were unlawful.\n\n\n\nAfter he was brought before the commission, Ziobro reiterated his position that it was illegally formed, citing a\u00a0[ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal](\u00a0(TK) \u2013 a body stacked with PiS-era judges \u2013 to that effect.\n\nThe current ruling coalition does not recognise the TK\u2019s legitimacy due to the fact that it contains\u00a0[judges unlawfully appointed](\u00a0when PiS was in power.\n\nDuring his subsequent testimony, Ziobro confirmed that he had been one of the initiators of the purchase of Pegasus when he was serving as justice minister and prosecutor general in the former PiS government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I did it, and I would do it again,\u201d said Ziobro, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). \u201cI decided that the state should have a tool to crack the smartphones of people who commit crimes and pose a real threat to the state.\u201d\n\n\n\nPegasus is a powerful spyware tool produced by Israeli firm NSO Group and which can be used to penetrate and surveil mobile phones. Human rights groups have raised concern that Pegasus has been used by authoritarian governments to spy on political opponents.\n\nIn the case of Poland, an investigation last year by the current government found that Pegasus was\u00a0[deployed against nearly 600 individuals](\u00a0between 2017 and 2022, when PiS was in power, including\u00a0[political opponents of the ruling party](\n\nDuring his testimony on Monday, however, Ziobro claimed that the tool was used against suspected criminals and terrorists. That included investigating \u201cmassive corruption by a man who was a close associate of \\[current Prime Minister\\] Donald Tusk\u201d, said Ziobro.\n\nThat was a reference to the case of S\u0142awomir Nowak, a former minister in a previous Tusk government, who was\u00a0[detained by anticorruption officers](\u00a0in 2020. He went on trial last year, accused of accepting bribes, but denies the charges.\n\n\n\nIn response to Ziobro\u2019s testimony, one of the members of the commission, Tomasz Trela, an MP from Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition, said that it would be used to formulate a motion to prosecutors to determine whether Ziobro had committed a crime.\n\nTrela was referring in particular to Ziobro\u2019s admission that he played a key role in the purchase of Pegasus, which prosecutors believe was carried out illegally. Last year, one of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy justice ministers, Micha\u0142 Wo\u015b, was\u00a0[charged for his role in overseeing the purchase](\n\nIn January this year, police also\u00a0[detained Ziobro and brought him to testify before the commission]( However, because he arrived late for the hearing, he was not questioned and the commission instead requested that he be detained for 30 days.

No longer", "summary": "Israel has always been vulnerable, but never alone. Now, for the first time in its existence, it might be heading there. \u201cIsrael is in a sort of isolation,\u201d admitted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month. He said the country needed to become a self-reliant \u201csuper Sparta\u201d, running \u201can economy with autarkic characteristics\u201d.\n\nSince Hamas\u2019s killing spree of October 7 2023, Israel has gone its own way, ignoring outside counsel. It has cut life expectancy in Gaza from 75 to just over 40, attacked five countries in a year and alienated some of its oldest allies. Even the American public\u2019s long-term support looks shaky. Could an isolated Israel survive?\n\nIsrael\u2019s current behaviour defies its own history. The secular Zionists who founded the state were desperate for allies. Guided by realpolitik, they mostly fought reactive wars. But Israel has become more religious while its allies secularised.\n\nThe growing bloc of religious Zionists entered politics and, more recently, the senior ranks of the military. Another group, the ultraorthodox Haredim, whose birth rates are the highest of any demographic in the developed world, already account for 14 per cent of Israelis. Haredim long shunned politics, with the men devoting themselves to studying the Torah, but they too are shifting right.\n\nMany religious ultranationalists, in particular, hope to expel the Palestinians and fulfil God\u2019s supposed plan by creating an expanded \u201cGreater Israel\u201d. Netanyahu encourages this belief. Speaking about the war in Gaza, he has invoked the Amalekites \u2014 the people that the Bible tells the Israelites to eliminate.\n\nPeople who are guided by God don\u2019t care much about what foreigners say. Nor do a broader group of Israelis who dismiss the outside world as irredeemably antisemitic. If the International Association of Genocide Scholars or Human Rights Watch conclude that Israel is committing genocide \u2014 well, they just hate Jews, don\u2019t they?\n\nThe \u201cno one likes us, we don\u2019t care\u201d logic informs Israeli attacks on Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Yemen and Qatar. Israel\u2019s military tech is the region\u2019s best, says Max Rodenbeck of the International Crisis Group.\n\nBut now these states see Israel \u2014 and its air-launched ballistic missiles that can strike any nearby capital \u2014 as the biggest threat they face. After Israel struck Doha on September 9, trying to kill Hamas\u2019s negotiators, about 50 Muslim countries held an emergency summit in Qatar. Saudi Arabia just signed a mutual-defence pact with [nuclear-armed Pakistan]( Netanyahu is jeopardising the groundbreaking \u201c[Abraham Accords]( that he signed with four Arab states in 2020 and 2021. Under George W Bush, the US blundered around the Middle East wreaking havoc too, but it could shrug and go home, whereas Israel lives there.\n\nCommitting the most public genocide in history is more than a crime. It\u2019s a strategic error. Historic allies like France, the UK and Canada are trying to take the mildest possible measures against Israel, says Daniel Levy of the US/Middle East Project, but they now feel obliged to recognise Palestine, while even Germany has restricted arms sales to Israel. A sports boycott could hurt \u2014 as it did a previous global pariah, apartheid South Africa.\n\nIsrael\u2019s biggest risk is losing the US. Donald Trump is nobody\u2019s loyal friend. Though he did protect Israel from Iranian counter-attacks in June with expensive American interceptor missiles, he only belatedly backed Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran, and said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d about the one on Qatar. If pressed, he might choose his rich Gulf friends over an unmanageable Netanyahu.\n\nOne day, Trump may leave behind a US that has never been colder towards Israel, its biggest recipient of foreign aid. The usual attitude shift of Americans during wars (think Vietnam and Iraq) has applied over Gaza: initial gung-ho bipartisan support dissipates amid the apparently endless slaughter of civilians. In a Gallup survey in March, just 46 per cent of Americans said they backed Israel, the lowest proportion since Gallup began tracking this measure 25 years ago.\n\nIsrael could end up friendless in an era of brutal wars, nuclear proliferation, faded memories of the Holocaust, cheap drone terrorism by groups like Yemen\u2019s Houthis, but without any \u201cinternational community\u201d to broker peace deals. Apartheid South Africa eventually collapsed. Meanwhile, hatred of Israel is fuelling antisemitism against diaspora Jews.
