You don't have to set remap again when you need to use another remap then set it back again after done. Just create multiple remap and activate or deactivate it whenever you want.|\n|2|**Double Click Format**|Remap double click into other keys. Example: Double pressing left click will send middle click.|\n|3|**Text Format**|Remap key into raw text. Example: Pressing Shift + 1 will send \"Worcestershire Sauce\".|\n|4|**Hold Format**|Remap key into a hold action. Example: Triggering mouse wheel up will hold left click for 10 seconds.|\n|5|**Multi Key Format**|Not just single keys, KeyTik supports remapping multiple keys too. This can be used for remapping or sending key. Example: Pressing Left Alt + v will send Shift + v.|\n|6|**Vast Keyboard and Mouse Key Support**|Supports a wide range of keyboard and mouse keys, even unusual ones. See\u00a0[List of Available Key](\u00a0for more. There are around 115 keyboard and mouse specific keys (like Tab, Shift, etc).|\n|7|**ASCII Character Support**|Supports remapping and sending ASCII characters. There are around 94 ASCII characters are supported.|\n|8|**ANSI Character Support**|Supports sending ANSI characters. There are around 122 ANSI characters are supported.|\n|9|**Unicode Character Support**|Supports sending Unicode characters. Unicode contains a vast number of characters. KeyTik groups them using Unicode blocks, and each block consists of different characters. There are around 302 supported blocks, with approximately 159,000+ Unicode characters.|\n|9|**Virtual Keyboard Code Support**|Supports remapping and sending VK codes. Virtual keyboard codes (VK codes) are keys defined by Windows. There are around 258 VK codes are supported.|\n|10|**Scan Code Support**|Supports remapping keys via SC. Scan codes (SC) are hardware-specific codes that indicate key location. This is useful if you can't find your key. SC will remaps the key at a specific location instead of a specific key. The number of supported scan codes depends on your keyboard.|\n|11|**Assign Shortcut on Profile**|Assign shortcuts to start or stop profiles. Supports Caps Lock On and Caps Lock Off states. Currently, shortcuts only start or stop the profile. We plan to add shortcut switching in the future, so shortcuts can change the remap when pressed. This is similar to how Caps Lock or Num Lock works.|\n|12|**Bind Profile to Specific Keyboard and Mouse**|Make script or remap profile to only work for specific physical keyboard or mouse using device VID &amp; PID or device handle as identifier.|\n|13|**Bind Profile to Specific Program**|Make script or remap profile to only work for specific programs class, like specific Chrome tab or entire program.|\n|14|**Auto Clicker**|KeyTik comes with Auto Clicker in the download. On default, it simulate 'left click' when 'e' is held. You can change the 'left click', 'e', interval part to your preference.|\n|15|**Screen Clicker**|KeyTik also comes with Screen Clicker in the download. It work with simulate 'left click' on specific screen coordinate. You can change coordinate and interval to your preference. Don't worry because KeyTik also comes with tool to find screen coordinate then it will automatically copy coordinate and you can paste it to screen clicker in text mode.|\n|16|**Screen Coordinate Auto Detect And Copy**|To make screen clicker editing easier, KeyTik also comes with coordinate finder. On default, you just need to press 'space' then it will show coordinate and automatically copy it. You can also change 'space' part to your preference.|\n|17|**Multiple Files Opener**|Multiple files opener also comes with KeyTik download. It work with, if you click key or key combination, then it will open the files. You can change the files with your files or programs path to your preference.|", "link": "https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik", "author": "None"}, {"title": "nwiz: Create Cisco IOS scripts from a network topology", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/itsbrunodev/nwiz", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Some insights from our weekly prompt engineering contest.", "summary": "Recently on Luna Prompts, we finished our first weekly contest where candidates had to write a prompt for a given problem statement, and that prompt was evaluated against our evaluation dataset.  \nThe ranking was based on whose prompt passed the most test cases from the evaluation dataset while using the fewest tokens.\n\nWe found that participants used different languages like Spanish and Chinese, and even models like Kimi 2, though we had GPT 4 models available.  \nInterestingly, in English, it might take 4 to 5 words to express an instruction, whereas in languages like Spanish or Chinese, it could take just one word. Naturally, that means fewer tokens are used.\n\nExample:  \nEnglish: Rewrite the paragraph concisely, keep a professional tone, and include exactly one actionable next step at the end. (23 Tokens)\n\nSpanish: Reescribe conciso, tono profesional, y a\u00f1ade un \u00fanico siguiente paso. (16 Tokens)\n\nThis could be a significant shift as the world might move toward using other languages besides English to prompt LLMs for optimisation on that front.\n\nUse cases could include internal routing of large agents or tool calls, where using a more compact language could help optimize the context window and prompts to instruct the LLM more efficiently.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure where this will lead, but think of it like programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python, each has its own features but ultimately serves to instruct machines. Similarly, we might see a future where we use languages like Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and English to instruct LLMs.\n\nWhat you guys think about this?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1o2clum/some_insights_from_our_weekly_prompt_engineering/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Attached files, filter functions, token counting", "summary": "So now when I attach any files they all get into the most recent user prompt.
