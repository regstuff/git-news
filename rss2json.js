Ground-penetrating radar surveys have revealed anomalies suggesting a large, rectangular structure possibly hidden beneath a modern cemetery. The structure may date to the Old Kingdom period (2575-2150 BCE), based on its architectural style. The site, located southeast of the Sphinx and near the Great Pyramid of Giza, is marked by a walled rectangular shape measuring approximately 320 by 160 feet. The anomalies hint at a building similar to known pyramid temples, potentially serving as a temple, administrative building, or other significant structure. Further excavation is required to confirm the structure's purpose and age. If verified, this discovery would shed new light on the extensive urban landscape surrounding the Giza pyramid complex.\n\n* [Teacher Finds Stone With Ancient Ogham Writing From Ireland in Coventry Garden]( \u2014 While clearing his garden in Coventry, England, a geography teacher discovered a sandstone rock inscribed with ogham, an early medieval alphabet. The rock, measuring about 4.3 inches long and weighing 4.9 ounces, features ogham script dating to the 5th or 6th century CE. The inscriptions read \"Maldumcail/S/Lass,\" potentially signifying a name and location. This find, rare for the Midlands, sheds light on early medieval activity in Coventry and suggests potential connections to Irish immigrants or monastic communities. Professional opinion: Ogham script is neat.\n\n* [Archaeologists Find Moated Medieval Windmill]( \u2014 Archaeologists uncovered a moated medieval windmill in Bedfordshire, England. The mill, dating between 1066 and 1485 CE, featured a central post partly buried in a large mound for support. This unique post-mill design, prevalent in Europe from the 1100s to 1200s, used a sunken post to orient its sails toward the wind. Though the mill's physical remains no longer survive, excavations revealed traces of a surrounding moat ditch created when forming the mound, and is a typical feature of sunken-type post mills. The waterlogged moat was filled with shells from water snails. Archaeologists also unearthed pottery sherds, medieval green glazed ware, animal bones, iron nails (possibly from the wooden mill structure), farming tools, clay tobacco pipe stems, and 17 pieces of millstones. Owning a mill was a powerful position for the local lord, who profited from flour sales and tenant rent.\n* [Roman Cupid Figurine Among Over 10,000 Artifacts Unearthed in Highway Dig]( \u2014 During an excavation ahead of a highway expansion project in Cambridgeshire, England, archaeologists uncovered over 10,000 artifacts, including a rare Roman Cupid figurine. The bronze statuette of Cupid dates to the 2nd century CE and is intricately detailed, depicting the deity with wings and a sash. The dig also revealed a wealth of other Roman-era finds, such as coins, pottery, and glassware, as well as remains of a Roman road and a villa. In addition, evidence of Iron Age activity was identified, including roundhouses, a human skeleton, and animal bones.\n* [Genome Study Traces Medieval Leprosy to England\u2019s Squirrels]( \u2014 A genomic study revealed that red squirrels likely contributed to spreading leprosy among humans in medieval England. Analysis of Mycobacterium leprae bacteria from 25 human remains and 12 squirrel remains at a leprosarium in Winchester shows that strains from both groups belonged to the same branch of the bacterial family tree. The strain found in medieval squirrels was more closely related to the strain found in medieval humans than to those found in modern red squirrels. During the medieval period, Winchester was a hub for the fur trade, and people frequently kept squirrels as pets or processed them for their pelts. This independent circulation of M. leprae between humans and squirrels suggests that the fur trade and close human-animal interaction were key factors in the transmission of leprosy. On a lighter note, when I hear \u201cmedieval squirrel\u201d, I immediately imagine a squirrel in full plate armor with a sword. Anyone else? No? Okay, me neither. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nHope you enjoyed this abridged version of\u00a0[Ancient Beat]( Have a great weekend!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1cpg5up/this_weeks_archaeological_news_moated_windmills/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Man known as \u2018eunuch maker\u2019 who streamed mutilations is jailed for life", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/09/man-eunuch-maker-streamed-mutilations-jailed-life-marius-gustavson", "author": "None"}, {"title": "California says restaurants must bake all of their add-on fees into menu prices", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2024/05/10/1249930674/california-restaurants-fees", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indian flag hoisted in POK, protest against Pakistani army and police", "summary": "\n\nI've been thinking since long time that why GoI is not engaging in regime change Or covert operations despite living in very hostile neighborhood and having considerable amount of resources.
