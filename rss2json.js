One thing though, was that the author was pretty good about describing the archaeological evidence for the conclusions he was drawing, except notably he never cited anything to substantiate his claim the men did the hunting and women sewed clothing from furs and skins. He repeated this assertion multiple times in the book without explaining the evidence.\n\nI know that within the past 5 years (well after the book I read was published) evidence has been found that indicates women often participated in hunting. It makes me wonder what, prior to that discovery, made archaeologists conclude that men generally hunted while women gathered/sewed clothing or otherwise took on a mostly domestic role. Was there evidence and if so what was it?\n\nI want to know if the assumption comes simply because women get pregnant and breastfeed, or if there were ever discoveries that can support that theory.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1gm6oyq/cromagnon_genderrole_evidence/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mkfd - RSS feed builder API created with Bun\ud83e\udd56 and Hono\ud83d\udd25", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glhug8", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
