Then, last month, the government began distributing 17 million hard copies. Around 4 million have already been sent out, and every household in Poland will receive one by 31 January, reports news website Portal Samorz\u0105dowy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d ask people to check their letterboxes and look at the most important information,\u201d said deputy defence minister Cezary Tomczyk, speaking to Polsat News. \u201cEveryone should read it, talk to their children, to their family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to prepare\u2026Poles so that we are all wiser before the event,\u201d added deputy interior minister Magdalena Roguska, quoted by Portal Samorz\u0105dowy.\n\nHowever, Marcin Samsel, a public security expert, told the\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*\u00a0daily that the handbook is not without flaws. \u201cPeople are told what to do, but without any attempt to explain why they should act in this way,\u201d he said.\n\nSamsel also pointed to conflicting information. For example, on page 13 of the guide, people are told to keep their car fuelled for a potential evacuation. But, three sentences later, they are advised to limit the use of a car during a crisis in order to keep roads clear for the emergency services and military.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has rapidly sought to improve its military and civil readiness for emergency situations.\n\nTwo years ago, it\u00a0[adopted a new law on civil defence](\u00a0and protection of the population \u2013 inspired by the civil protection strategies of Nordic countries \u2013 that introduced mandatory training for officials and new rules for managing protective infrastructure such as shelters.\n\nLast month, the interior ministry\u00a0[launched a mobile application](\u00a0and website that allows people to find their nearest shelter in times of war or other emergencies.\n\nThe government also faced criticism in 2024 over its response to\u00a0[deadly floods](\u00a0that hit parts of the country, with the opposition\u00a0[calling for](\u00a0Prime Minister Donald Tusk to be held criminally responsible for his alleged failings.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/12/government-sends-safety-handbook-to-every-household-in-poland/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Taliban rift at the top of the leadership in Afghanistan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg7vdpy1l2vo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan's main opposition CDPJ, Komeito agree to form new party", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/68570", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Junior Polish ruling party invalidates leadership election amid claims of \u201cexternal interference\u201d", "summary": "The centrist Poland 2050 party, a junior partner in the ruling coalition, has invalidated the results of its leadership election after technical problems disrupted online voting, with officials saying there had been attempts at \u201cexternal interference\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the party\u2019s current leader, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, who was meant to be stepping down once a successor was chosen in the election, has now said that he does not rule out reversing course and standing in a newly called leadership election.\n\nPoland 2050 is part of the coalition, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Civic Coalition (KO) party, that took power in December 2023. It has 31 of the coalition\u2019s 240 members of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament.\n\nIn September, the party\u2019s founder and leader, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia,\u00a0[announced](\u00a0that he would step down when his term ended in January. That prompted a contest to choose his successor.\n\nIn a first-round vote, held on Saturday, none of the five candidates won a majority of votes, meaning that the two most popular \u2013 Katarzyna Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz, the minister for funds and regional policy, and climate minister Paulina Hennig-Kloska \u2013 stood in a run-off election on Monday.\n\nThe results were due to be announced at 10 p.m. But, after a delay, the party revealed that the election had been invalidated because of technical issues with the online voting system.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the voting system stopped working and some politicians received links that did not work,\u201d Ignacy Niemczycki, a deputy foreign minister from Poland 2050, told broadcaster RMF.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a system error, but we don\u2019t rule out external interference or a hacker attack,\u201d one of the party\u2019s MPs, Kamil Wnuk, told the\u00a0*Wprost*\u00a0newspaper.\n\nThat was then confirmed by Ho\u0142ownia himself, who said that \u201ceverything indicates there was an external attempt to disrupt our electoral process\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver 20,000 attempts to access the system have been recorded,\u201d he added, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). \u201cThe company providing this service is investigating how this happened and who is behind it.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Polska (BIP) reports that the party used Interankiety, a commercial survey platform. BIP suggested that the administrators of the vote may not have enabled all of the necessary safeguards on the service to ensure the security of voting.\n\nBroadcaster TVN reported that problems had already emerged during the first round on Saturday, with some delegates unable to access the voting link. TVN\u2019s reporter, Micha\u0142 Go\u0142\u0119biowski, found that only 656 votes were cast out of more than 800 eligible delegates.\n\nRegarding what will happen next, Ho\u0142ownia today outlined two possible scenarios: a repeat of the second round of voting or a repeat of the entire election. He said the party\u2019s leadership would meet on Friday to decide how to proceed.\n\nAsked if he would now reverse his decision to step down and stand in the leadership election, if a new one is called, Ho\u0142ownia did not rule it out. \u201cIf it turns out that this is a solution that will help Poland in 2050, I will not shirk it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he announced in September that he would stand down as leader, Ho\u0142ownia also revealed that he was applying to become the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees. However, in December, Iraqi Barham Salih was chosen for the role, taking up the post on 1 January.\n\nThe confusion over Poland 2050\u2019s leadership election was met with mockery and disbelief by other politicians, including some partners in the ruling coalition.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you vote normally at the \\[party\\] convention/congress? Who will believe these results now?\u201d wrote Anna-Maria \u017bukowska, who is chairwoman of the parliamentary caucus of The Left (Lewica), one of Poland\u2019s ruling groups.\n\n\u201cThese people rule Poland\u2026A comedy drama,\u201d commented Olga Semeniuk-Patkowska, an MP from the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party.\n\nThe leadership contest comes as Poland 2050\u2019s support has fallen well below the threshold of 5% needed at elections to enter parliament. Over the last few months, the party has been polling around 2% support.\n\nIn the 2023 parliamentary elections, Poland 2050 stood jointly with the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL) under the name Third Way, winning 14.4% of the vote.\n\nHowever, they\u00a0[decided to split](\u00a0last year, while both remaining part of Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition.
