There are two model versions: a Base model trained on multi-speaker audio data for zero-shot TTS, and an SFT model fine-tuned on single-speaker data for better voice cloning. We also release the training code from the base model to the SFT model for speaker adaptation. It runs efficiently, generating one second of audio in about 0.33 seconds on standard GPUs, and supports lightweight fine-tuning without needing large compute resources.\nWe focused on solving practical issues like long-form stability, easy retrainability, and efficient deployment. The model uses a fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2-3B as the semantic encoder and an optimized SoVITS-based decoder. Data cleaning is handled through pipelines built on Whisper, FunASR, and NISQA filtering.\n\nWhy Open-source This?\n\nWe believe that, just like Samantha in Her, voice will become a core way for humans to interact with AI \u2014 making it possible for everyone to have an AI companion they can talk to anytime. Muyan-TTS is only a small step in that direction. There's still a lot of room for improvement in model design, data preparation, and training methods. We hope that others who are passionate about speech technology, TTS, or real-time voice interaction will join us on this journey. We\u2019re looking forward to your feedback, ideas, and contributions.

I organise the data and enhance the datasets with additional tags from things like aspect-based sentiment analysis, NER, and semantic categories from Empath. \n\nDoing this has allowed me to better slice and compare observations that match certain criteria / research question (I.e., analyse all Reddit data on \u2018ergonomic chairs\u2019 where the aspect is \u2018lumbar-support\u2019, the sentiment negative and the entity is \u2018Herman Miller\u2019, for example). \n\nThis works well and also allows LLMs to ingest this more structured and concise data for summaries etc.\n\nHowever I feel I am hitting a wall in what I can extract. I\u2019d like to ask whether there are any additional methods I should be using to tag, organise and analyse these types of conversational data to extract insights relating to user / market challenges? I\u2019m a big fan of only using LLMs for more lightweight tasks on smaller datasets to avoid hallucination etc - thanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1keiowr/advice_on_modelling_conversational_data_to/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
