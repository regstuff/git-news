(My undergrad was in Linguistics &amp; German.) I am constrained somewhat by travel distances, which has narrowed the options down to these two courses.  \n  \nThe Forensic Ling &amp; Speech Science course interests me as I am quite interested in its application in cybersecurity and also authorship in public discourse (incl. things like deepfakes, bots, AI-generated text, plagiarism, etc.). The department I am looking at works closely with security organisations and inter-disciplinary research groups and has an excellent reputation. My concern is that forensic linguistics itself might be quite a narrow field and would you need either work within law enforcement or be at doctorate level before having an opportunity to use these skills in any direct way. My interests lean towards industry rather than the civil service.\n\nI had originally been looking at language and speech processing courses and have been taking programming courses over the last year or so in anticipation of a masters in this area. The CompLing &amp; CorpLing course I am considering has less of a speech component than I'd like (there are some optional modules on phonetics, but it is not a central focus of the course, unlike many similar courses which balance language and speech processing). This is a minus for me, however there is a clear focus on compling, NLP, etc., which I feel makes it potentially a safer bet than the forensic linguistics course in terms of prospects in industry and also transferable data and computer science skills. This university is also very well regarded and ranks very highly.\n\nI am wondering if there is anyone working within language technology or who has a masters in either of these areas who might be able to offer any insight into the prospects for the respective qualifications?

If we only see the word \u8afa\u8a9e, it's impossible to know if it's Chinese or Japanese.\n\n- Another issue is with characters that have multiple pronunciations, like \u5f97, which can be read as \"d\u011bi\" or \"de\" depending on the context.\n\n- Sometimes, the pronunciation is incorrect for no apparent reason. For instance, in \u8ddd\u79bb, the last syllable should be \"li,\" but it\u2019s sometimes pronounced as \"zhi.\" (Had this issue using ElevenLabs with certain speakers)\n\nDespite English having one of the most inconsistent orthographies, these kinds of errors seem less frequent, likely due to the use of letters. However, it seems to me that a lot of companies train on raw data, without using a grapheme-to-phoneme model. Maybe the hope is that with more data, the model will learn the correct pronunciations.
