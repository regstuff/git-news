In experiments, LC-Boost performed as well or better with 4,000 tokens than models with up to 200,000 tokens.\r\n\r\n3/ LC-Boost consumes significantly less energy than models that process the entire text at once. The authors see their approach as an important step toward getting a handle on the resource consumption of large language models, since smart methods with smaller windows deliver at least equivalent results for many tasks.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1d2fpn6/do_large_language_models_really_need_large/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany's Support for lsrael Has Harmed Its Reputation Across the Middle East", "summary": "", "link": "https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/05/24/germany-israel-gaza-palestine-war-middle-east-politics-soft-power-speech/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mossad chief 'threatened' ICC prosecutor over war crimes inquiry - report - I24NEWS", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/artc-mossad-chief-threatened-icc-prosecutor-over-war-crimes-inquiry-report", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Seoul to Offer Cash for Vasectomy Reversals in Bid to Boost Birth Rate", "summary": "", "link": "https://time.com/6982555/south-korea-seoul-subsidizes-reverse-vasectomy-tubectomy-low-birth-rate/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK set for '50 days of rain' in one of the wettest summers in over a hundred years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/uk-set-for-50-days-of-rain-in-one-of-the-wettest-summers-in-over-a-hundred-years/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Georgian parliament overrides presidential veto of the divisive foreign influence bill", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/georgian-lawmakers-debate-overriding-presidential-veto-divisive-foreign-110606310", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Majority of US voters support climate litigation against big oil, poll shows | Climate crisis", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/28/poll-climate-change-lawsuit-oil-industry", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Spanish court orders FIFA and UEFA to stop anticompetitive conduct in Super League case", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish court orders FIFA and UEFA to stop anticompetitive conduct in Super League case</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMjgvc3BvcnQvc3VwZXItbGVhZ3VlLXNwYW5pc2gtY291cnQtZmlmYS11ZWZhLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-05-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rafael Nadal says playing Wimbledon is \u2018not a good idea\u2019 as he looks to prioritize Paris Olympics", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Rafael Nadal says playing Wimbledon is \u2018not a good idea\u2019 as he looks to prioritize Paris Olympics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMjgvc3BvcnQvcmFmYWVsLW5hZGFsLXdpbWJsZWRvbi1wYXJpcy1vbHltcGljcy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-05-28", "author": "None"}]}}};
