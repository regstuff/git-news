(TL;DR at the bottom)\n\nI am quite new here since I stumbled upon the subreddit by chance while looking up information about a specific master's program.\n\nI recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in (theoretical) Linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, sociolinguistics etc.) and I loved my major (graduated with almost a 3.9 GPA) but didn't want to rush into a master's program blindly without deciding what I would like to REALLY focus on or specialize in. I could always see myself continuing with theoretical linguistics stuff and eventually going down the 'academia' route; but realizing the network, time and luck one would need to have to secure a position in academia made me have doubts. I honestly can't stand the thought of having a PhD in linguistics just because I am passionate about the field, only to end up unemployed at the age of 30+, so I decided to venture into a different branch.\n\nI have to be honest, I am not the most well-versed person out there when it comes to CL or NLP but I took a course focusing on computational methods in linguistics around a year ago, which fascinated me. Throughout the course, we looked at regex, text processing, n-gram language models, finite state automata etc. but besides the little bit of Python I learned for that course, I barely have any programming knowledge/experience (I also took a course focusing on data analysis with R but not sure how much that helps).\n\nI am not pursuing any degree as of now, you can consider it to be something similar to a gap year and since I want to look into CL/NLP/LT-specific programs, I think I can use my free time to gain some programming knowledge by the time the application periods start, I have at least 6-8 months after all.\n\nI want to apply to master's programs for the upcoming academic year (2025/2026) and I have already started researching. However, not long after I started, I realized that there were quite a few programs available and they all had different names, different program content and approaches to the area of LT(?). I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of options; so, I wanted to make this post to get some advice.\n\nI would love to hear your advice/suggestions if anyone here has completed, is still doing or has knowledge about any CL/NLP/LT master's program that would be suitable for someone with a solid foundation in theoretical linguistics but not so much in CS, coding or maths. **I am mainly interested in programs in Germany** (I have already looked into a few there such as Stuttgart, Potsdam, Heidelberg etc. but I don't know what I should look for when deciding which programs to apply to) but feel free to chime in if you have anything to say about any program in Europe. What are the most important things to look for when choosing programs to apply to? Which programs do you think would prepare a student the best, considering the 'fluctuating' nature of the industry?\n\nP.S.: I assume there are a lot of people from the US on the subreddit but I am not located anywhere near, so studying in the US isn't one of my options.\n\nTL;DR: **Which CL/NLP/LT master's programs in Europe would you recommend to someone with a strong background in Linguistics (preferably in Germany)?**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1gfrnux/clnlplt_masters_programs_in_europe/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MaskGCT: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Masked Generative Codec Transformer", "summary": "", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00750", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A new study once again confirms that the way texts are broken down into tokens has a significant influence on the ability of AI language models to solve simple counting tasks.", "summary": "", "link": "https://the-decoder.com/ai-keeps-failing-at-basic-math-because-of-tokenization/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Google has just been fined a comically large amount of money - here\u2019s what it means", "summary": "\"It has been ordered to pay $2 undecillion, a number so hilariously large it has 36 zeros in it (a million has six for reference). \"\n\n\u2026\n\n\"at least according to the World Bank\u2019s estimate for the global GDP - around $105 trillion in 2023.\"\n", "link": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/google-massive-russian-fine-4845946", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US airlines required to automatically refund you for canceled flight", "summary": "", "link": "https://abc7news.com/post/us-airlines-required-automatically-refund-significantly-changed-canceled-flight/15483534/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Malcolm Wallace, father of hero of Scottish independence, William Wallace, was cut down in a battle after being declared an outlaw.

But elsewhere along the front, Russia is slicing its way through Ukrainian defences. In Kupiansk in the north, its troops have cut Ukrainian formations in two at the Oskil river. In Chasiv Yar in the east, they have crossed the main Siverskyi Donets canal, after six months of trying. Farther south, Russian troops have taken high ground in and around [Vuhledar]( (pictured), and are moving in on Kurakhove from two directions. In Kursk, inside Russia, Ukraine has lost around half the territory it seized earlier this year.\n\nThe problem is not so much the loss of territory, which is limited and has come at enormous cost to Russia\u2014600,000 dead and wounded since the start of the war, on American estimates, and 57,000 dead in this year to October alone, according to Ukrainian intelligence\u2014as the steady erosion in the size and quality of Ukraine\u2019s forces. Ukrainian units are understrength and overstretched, worn thin by heavy casualties. Despite a [new mobilisation law]( that took effect in May, the army, outside a handful of brigades, has struggled to recruit enough replacements, with young men reluctant to sign up to tours of duty that are at best indefinite and, at worst, one-way missions. Western partners are privately urging Ukraine\u2019s leaders to lower the mobilisation age floor from 25 to increase the potential pool of recruits. But political sensitivities and fears over an already alarming demographic crisis stand in the way of any change.\n\nIn a recent essay, Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London, identifies several reasons for Ukraine\u2019s declining fortunes. One is a shortfall in its air-defence interceptors, allowing Russian reconnaissance drones to establish what he calls \u201ccontinuous and dense surveillance\u201d. These in turn cue up ballistic-missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian artillery in the rear and glide bombs against troops at the front, allowing Russia to make slow but steady advances in small units, often using motorcycles because tanks are too easy to spot. Ukraine\u2019s limited stock of shells\u2014Russia currently has a two-to-one advantage in shellfire, according to Ivan Havrilyuk, Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister\u2014as well as tanks and armoured vehicles compounds that problem. The less firepower and armour are available, the greater the reliance on infantry and the greater the casualties.\n\nRussia is not without its own [serious problems]( Next year it will spend a third of its national budget on defence, starving the civilian economy in the process. Inflation is perhaps double the official annual rate of more than 8%. In 2025 ordinary Russian families will begin to feel the economic pain for the first time, says a European intelligence official, adding that there are early signs of war fatigue among those closely connected to the conflict, such as mothers and family members.\n\nOn the battlefield, Russia remains reliant on crude tactics that result in massive casualties. The decision to borrow thousands of North Korean troops, who are thought to be bound for the Kursk front, shows that Russian units are also stretched. Russia\u2019s general staff and defence ministry have put \u201cheavy pressure\u201d on the Kremlin to mobilise more men, says the European official. \u201cRussia now doesn\u2019t have sufficient forces to mass,\u201d says a senior nato official. \u201cIf they achieved a breakthrough they could not exploit it.\u201d There is little short-term risk of Russian troops streaming west to Dnipro or Odessa.\n\nBut the crisis in Russia\u2019s [war economy]( is likely to play out over a longer period. Russia\u2019s defence industry is in part dependent on the refurbishment of Soviet-era stocks, which are getting low in critical areas such as armoured vehicles. It is nonetheless far outperforming Western production lines. The European Union claims to be making more than 1m shells per year; Russia is making three times that, and is also boosted by supplies from North Korea and Iran. \u201cI just don\u2019t know we can produce enough, give enough,\u201d says a person familiar with the flow of American aid, though a recent $800m commitment to boost Ukraine\u2019s indigenous drone production is welcome. \u201cWe have no more to give them without taking serious risks in other places.\u201d On manpower, too, Russia remains solvent. Its army is recruiting around 30,000 men per month, says the nato official. That is not enough to meet internal targets, says another official, but it is adequate to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months.\n\nRussia cannot fight for ever. But the worry among America, European and Ukrainian officials is that, on current trends, Ukraine\u2019s breaking point will come first. \u201cMoscow seems to be wagering that it can achieve its objectives in the Donbas next year,\u201d writes Mr Watling, \u201cand impose a rate of casualties and material degradation on the Ukrainian military high enough that it will no longer be capable of preventing further advances.\u201d That, he warns, would give Russia leverage in any negotiations that follow.\n\nThe gloomy mood is evident in a shift in America\u2019s language. Senior officials like Mr Austin still strike a confident note, promising that Ukraine will win. Those involved in the guts of planning in the Pentagon say that, in practice, the ambitions of early 2023\u2014a Ukrainian force that could take back its territory or shock Russia into talks through a well-crafted armoured punch\u2014have given way to a narrow focus on preventing defeat. \u201cAt this point we are thinking more and more about how Ukraine can survive,\u201d says a person involved in that planning. Others put it more delicately. \u201cThe next several months\u201d, noted Jim O\u2019Brien, the State Department\u2019s top Europe official, at a conference in Riga on October 19th, \u201care an opportunity for us to reaffirm that Ukraine can stay on the battlefield for the next couple of years.\u201d", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1gfj7pl/ukraine_is_now_struggling_to_survive_not_to_win/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India, China complete disengagement at Depsang and Demchok in Ladakh", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-china-complete-border-disengagement-depsang-demchok-ladakh-9646221/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel issues evacuation warning for Lebanon&amp;#x27;s Baalbek, including Roman ruins area | The entire Unesco-listed city has been put under bombing notice | The order also covers the area where Baalbek\u2019s famed Roman ruins, which include one of the world\u2019s largest standing Roman temples, are located.\n", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-issues-evacuation-warning-lebanons-baalbek-including-roman-ruins-area-2024-10-30/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sexual violence on 'staggering' scale in Sudan civil war: UN probe", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/sexual-violence-on-staggering-scale-in-sudan-civil-war-un-probe/articleshow/114730911.cms?from=mdr", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Erdogan says Turkey aims to have \"Steel Dome\" air defence system", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/erdogan-says-turkey-aims-steel-154215248.html?guccounter=1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Starmer's Approval Rating Tanks To Historic Low For New PM In Modern Era", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/starmers-approval-rating-drops-to-historic-low-for-modern-pm_uk_6720a09be4b0a55cb4ce228f", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trade data shows that an Indian pharmaceutical company has exported over 1,100 high-performance servers with powerful Nvidia and AMD chips for AI to Russia, despite Western sanctions.", "summary": "", "link": "https://the-decoder.com/indian-company-ships-300-million-worth-of-ai-servers-to-russia-despite-western-bans/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologist parents ", "summary": "How do you deal with being away from your family so much?

I go back and forth between, \"I love archaeology\" and \"I don't want to be a barista during the off-season\".\n\nRecently, I have been looking into geology because I find the field interesting, but not to the same degree that I like archaeology (like a second choice in order to have enough money to survive). Somehow, I only recently came to the realization that I can become a geology archaeologist (geo-archaeologist? I am not sure what is the correct term) and/or an archaeologist with a focus in geology (I am still researching this career combination with not many results so if there is a difference between them do not be afraid to tell me what makes them different).\n\nIn my head, becoming a geo-archaeologist will allow me to work in more in archaeology during the on-season, then work in geology during the off-season in order to provide myself with a more stable income. Right now this is just an idea, but I am researching, contacting archaeologists and archaeological societies, and asking Reddit to see if my idea is feasible and has ever been done by anyone.\n\nAs I said, I am still researching this idea, but beyond this I am curious. What education do you think this would require? Would I be able to have multiple focuses and specialties in archaeology? (I like geology and it's important in archaeology, but I really like history and don't want to be held back from taking part in certain aspects of excavations and other surveys because I am also a geologist).\n\nAt this point I am considering majoring in archaeology and geology (though specifically I do not know). I am taking a year off after my first academic year at my university to figure out what I plan to major in and what field I go into. I know that archaeology and geology both require a master's degree in order to be more successful at this time--geology I think (because it is similar to archaeology since some fields of geology broadly focus on the history of the Earth) and hope may not require a master's degree to do well but I am not confident that it won't require a master's.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1gg03r3/can_i_be_an_archaeologist_and_a_geologist/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Has India made friends with China after the Modi-Xi agreement?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.brookings.edu/articles/has-india-made-friends-with-china-after-the-modi-xi-agreement/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Does anyone know where this sword comes from?", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/ue2nbidyrxxd1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Korea considers sending team to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/south-koreas-yoon-trudeau-warn-over-north-korea-role-ukraine-war-yoons-office-2024-10-30/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
