The country has been at the center of geopolitical tension with India ever since the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia, an event that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau openly blamed on Indian involvement\u2014without presenting concrete evidence. What followed was a diplomatic storm, souring India-Canada relations.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s consistent sympathy towards Khalistani extremists under the guise of freedom of expression, despite growing evidence of their involvement in hate speech, violence, and attacks on Indian diplomats as only made the relationship worse. His failure to take serious action against anti-India elements operating freely on Canadian soil has long been a point of contention for Indians worldwide.\n\nOn the otherside, the silence of the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who often dodged the issue of Khalistani violence and never explicitly condemned the attacks on temples or threats to Indian diplomats is also questionable. It's understandable that the conservatives need votes from urban amalgations like Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton, which hold a decent chunk of Punjabi voter, and by taking a stand for or against the Khalistan movement, Poilievre would be isolating the other half of the voters.\n\nThis election, however, brought major upsets and changes, especially among Punjabi-origin candidates:\n\n**Key Defeats**\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP and an open supporter of the Khalistan movement, suffered a humiliating loss\u2014coming third in his constituency. His party\u2019s disastrous performance will likely cost it its national party status, effectively ending his political career.\n\nKamal Khera, a former federal minister in the new Carney-led Liberal cabinet, also lost her seat\u2014ironically to another Punjabi candidate, Amarjeet Gill. Khera was a vocal critic of India post-Nijjar and pushed for stronger actions against India.\n\nAmarjeet Sohi, the mayor of Edmonton, lost the federal race but will continue in his mayoral role. Alongside Harjit Sajjan, who chose not to contest this time, Sohi had earlier distanced himself from the Khalistan issue, stating that he was \u201cneither for nor against\u201d the movement\u2014a position clarified after Captain Amarinder Singh refused to meet them during Trudeau\u2019s infamous visit to Punjab.\n\nGeorge Chahal and Kamal Khera, both considered soft Khalistan sympathizers, were also shown the door by voters. It would interesting to see if Khera, the former Health Minister is replaced by another Punjabi or not.\n\n**Biggest Losses for India**\n\nChandra Arya, a rare voice of reason in Canadian politics who staunchly opposed the Khalistan movement and openly called for curbing future extremist threats, had his candidacy cancelled by the Liberal Party. His seat of Nepean was handed over to none other than the new PM, Mark Carney. Arya, a Karnataka-origin MP, was the only one to consistently speak up for India\u2019s interests in Parliament. His exit is a major blow.\n\nTim Uppal, deputy Conservative leader and a vocal Khalistan sympathizer, managed to win his seat. With Poilievre losing in Carleton, a leadership vacuum is likely in the Conservative Party. If Uppal runs and wins, India-Canada ties could hit a new low\u2014this would be the first time one of the two big party leader is openly sympathetic to the Khalistan cause.\n\n**New Punjabi MPs**\n\nDespite the losses, a record 22 Punjabi-origin MPs were elected this time, with many of them being first time MPs. It remains to be seen how they position themselves on the Khalistan issue, which continues to divide the diaspora.

Unlike standard prompting where you request a finished product immediately, this method breaks the creation process into distinct steps - similar to how professional writers work through multiple drafts.\n\n## Why Chain of Draft Works So Well\n\nThe magic of Chain of Draft lies in its structured iterative approach:\n\n1. Each draft builds upon the previous one\n2. You can provide feedback between drafts\n3. The AI focuses on different aspects at each stage\n4. The process mimics how human experts create high-quality content\n\n## Implementing Chain of Draft: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### Step 1: Initial Direction\n\nFirst, provide Claude with clear instructions about the overall goal and the multi-stage process you'll follow:\n\n\nI'd like to create a high-quality [content type] about [topic] using a Chain of Draft approach. We'll work through several drafting stages, focusing on different aspects at each stage:\n\nStage 1: Initial rough draft focusing on core ideas and structure\nStage 2: Content expansion and development\nStage 3: Refinement for language, flow, and engagement\nStage 4: Final polishing and quality control\n\nLet's start with Stage 1 - please create an initial rough draft that establishes the main structure and key points.\n\n\n### Step 2: Review and Direction Between Drafts\n\nAfter each draft, provide specific feedback and direction for the next stage:\n\n\nThanks for this initial draft. For Stage 2, please develop the following sections further:\n1. [Specific section] needs more supporting evidence\n2. [Specific section] could use a stronger example\n3. [Specific section] requires more nuanced analysis\n\nAlso, the overall structure looks good, but let's rearrange [specific change] to improve flow.\n\n\n### Step 3: Progressive Refinement\n\nWith each stage, shift your focus from broad structural concerns to increasingly detailed refinements:\n\n\nThe content is taking great shape. For Stage 3, please focus on:\n1. Making the language more engaging and conversational\n2. Strengthening transitions between sections\n3. Ensuring consistency in tone and terminology\n4. Replacing generic statements with more specific ones\n\n\n### Step 4: Final Polishing\n\nIn the final stage, focus on quality control and excellence:\n\n\nFor the final stage, please:\n1. Check for any logical inconsistencies\n2. Ensure all claims are properly qualified\n3. Optimize the introduction and conclusion for impact\n4. Add a compelling title and section headings\n5. Review for any remaining improvements in clarity or precision\n\n\n## Real-World Example: Creating a Product Description\n\n### Stage 1 - Initial Request:\n\nI need to create a product description for a premium AI prompt creation toolkit. Let's use Chain of Draft. First, create an initial structure with the main value propositions and sections.\n\n\n### Stage 2 - Development Direction:\n\nGood start. Now please expand the \"Features\" section with more specific details about each capability. Also, develop the \"Use Cases\" section with more concrete examples of how professionals would use this toolkit.\n\n\n### Stage 3 - Refinement Direction:\n\nLet's refine the language to be more persuasive. Replace generic benefits with specific outcomes customers can expect. Also, add some social proof elements and enhance the call-to-action.\n\n\n### Stage 4 - Final Polish Direction:\n\nFor the final version, please:\n1. Add a compelling headline\n2. Format the features as bullet points for skimmability\n3. Add a price justification paragraph\n4. Include a satisfaction guarantee statement\n5. Make sure the tone conveys exclusivity and premium quality throughout\n\n\n## Why Chain of Draft Outperforms Traditional Prompting\n\n1. **Mimics professional processes**: Professional writers rarely create perfect first drafts\n2. **Maintains context**: The AI remembers previous drafts and feedback\n3. **Allows course correction**: You can guide the development at multiple points\n4. **Creates higher quality**: Step-by-step refinement leads to superior output\n5. **Leverages expertise more effectively**: You can apply your knowledge at each stage\n\n## Chain of Draft vs. Other Methods\n\n| Method | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Single Prompt | Quick, simple | Limited refinement, often generic |\n| Iterative Feedback | Some improvement | Less structured, can be inefficient |\n| Chain of Thought | Good for reasoning | Focused on thinking, not content quality |\n| Chain of Draft | Highest quality, structured process | Takes more time, requires planning |\n\n## Advanced Tips\n\n1. **Variable focus stages**: Customize stages based on your project (research stage, creativity stage, etc.)\n2. **Draft-specific personas**: Assign different expert personas to different drafting stages\n3. **Parallel drafts**: Create alternative versions and combine the best elements\n4. **Specialized refinement stages**: Include stages dedicated to particular aspects (SEO, emotional appeal, etc.)\n\nThe Chain of Draft technique has transformed my prompt engineering work, allowing me to create content that genuinely impresses clients. While it takes slightly more time than single-prompt approaches, the dramatic quality improvement makes it well worth the investment.\n\nWhat Chain of Draft techniques are you currently using?
