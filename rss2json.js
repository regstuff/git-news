Is there any good master degree in Europe where I can study this? \n\nAlso, which kind of jobs could be suitable for this speciality of speech technology? Is there work in this field nowadays? I would love to work in something related to accents or dialects (maybe identifying different accents or being able to create accent models for IA). Is it something realistic? \n\nThanks!

I saw people commenting that they coded their own tools/functions, so I decided to take a stab at it as well.\n\n# What I Built\n\nBased off existing auto tool functions (take users inputs and have an AI decide if a tool is needed), I built mine with better system prompts and a short thinking pipeline for more accurate decisions. It supports the standard tools like image gen and code interpreter (since I use Jupyter I wrote a uploader so the model can return files + a big sys prompt injection to the model when CI is called), plus I added support for chat-based image models (GPT-Image-1). The function also uses historical context to handle complex and vague requests more effectively.\n\nThen, since I had some Exa credits, I built a 3-mode search tool:\n\n* Crawl - reads a specific URL\n* Standard - crawls 3 results from a keyword search\n* Complete - crawls, reads, reflects (thinking pipeline + notes), generates new searches, ... , summaries/return full context\n\nThey all use smaller models to act as agents and do tasks like deciding, searching, reading, etc., to give the base model more autonomy and capabilities in general.\n\n[Current setup system diagram](\n\n**Links if you want to check it out:**\n\n* [Auto Tool Router Function](\n* [Exa Search Router Tool](\n\n# My Questions\n\nBut I also have some questions. **Is there currently any other way for models to act and call tools truly autonomously?**\n\nMy current setup is great at most things, but there are still times where it misinterprets. I tried enabling tools for it manually within the plus button in the chat. Somehow it seems like it's able to use tools at will, but even with a decent model (GPT-4.1), it works for a bit (uses tools when needed), then gets stuck on using them every single turn again (when questions clearly don't require search and I'm yelling at it to stop).\n\nI think the only thing that can truly be called by the model consistently at will would be the code interpreter. Once you tell it how, it does a good job at calling when needed since it uses XML tags.\n\n**So this got me wondering:** is it possible to make custom XML tags and have the model call those? Because wouldn't that be a huge step up from what we have currently? But I'm not able to find any documentation regarding that though.\n\nCan anyone provide me with some insights regarding that and my potential next steps for this project?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1m5jtyn/made_my_own_auto_tool_system_and_enhanced_web/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Openwebui + qdrant", "summary": "I have a qdrant instance that I use to store paperless-ngx docs.
