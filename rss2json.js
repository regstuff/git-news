Essential knowledge and tools should always be accessible, helping everyone innovate, collaborate, and achieve better outcomes - without financial barriers.*\n\nIf you've ever created digital ads, you know how exhausting it can be to produce endless variations. It eats up hours and quickly gets costly. That\u2019s why I use **ChatGPT** to rapidly generate social ad creatives.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT isn't perfect - it sometimes introduces quirks like distorted text, misplaced elements, or random visuals. For quickly fixing these issues, I rely on **Canva**. Here's my simple workflow:\n\n1. Generate images using ChatGPT. I'll upload the layout image, which you can download for free in the PDF guide, along with my filled-in prompt framework.\n\n*Example prompt:*\n\n    Create a bold and energetic advertisement for a pizza brand. Use the following layout:\n    Header: \"Slice Into Flavor\"\n    Sub-label: \"Every bite, a flavor bomb\"\n    Hero Image Area: Place the main product \u2013 a pan pizza with bubbling cheese, pepperoni curls, and a crispy crust\n    Primary Call-out Text: \u201cWhich slice would you grab first?\u201d\n    Options (Bottom Row): Showcase 4 distinct product variants or styles, each accompanied by an engaging icon or emoji:\n    Option 1 (\ud83d\udc4dlike icon): Pepperoni Lover's \u2013 Image of a cheesy pizza slice stacked with curled pepperoni on a golden crust.\n    Option 2 (\u2764\ufe0flove icon): Spicy Veggie \u2013 Image of a colorful veggie slice with jalape\u00f1os, peppers, red onions, and olives.\n    Option 3 (\ud83d\ude06 haha icon): Triple Cheese Melt \u2013 Image of a slice with stretchy melted mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan bubbling on top.\n    Option 4 (\ud83d\ude2e wow icon): Bacon &amp; BBQ \u2013 Image of a thick pizza slice topped with smoky bacon bits and swirls of BBQ sauce.\n    Design Tone: Maintain a bold and energetic atmosphere. Accentuate the advertisement with red and black gradients, pizza-sauce textures, and flame-like highlights.\n\n2. Check for visual errors or distortions.\n\n3. Use Canva tools like Magic Eraser, Grab Text,... to remove incorrect details and add accurate text and icons\n\nI've detailed the entire workflow clearly in a downloadable PDF - I'll leave the free link for you in the comment!\n\n**If You're a Digital Marketer New to AI:** You can follow the guidebook from start to finish. It shows exactly how I use ChatGPT to create layout designs and social media visuals, including my detailed prompt framework and every step I take. Plus, there's an easy-to-use template included, so you can drag and drop your own images.\n\n**If You're a Digital Marketer Familiar with AI:** You might already be familiar with layout design and image generation using ChatGPT but want a quick solution to fix text distortions or minor visual errors. Skip directly to page 22 to the end, where I cover that clearly.\n\nIt's important to take your time and practice each step carefully. It might feel a bit challenging at first, but the results are definitely worth it. And the best part? I'll be sharing essential guides like this every week - for free. You won't have to pay anything to learn how to effectively apply AI to your work.\n\nIf you get stuck at any point creating your social ad visuals with ChatGPT, just drop a comment, and I'll gladly help. Also, because I release free guidebooks like this every week - so let me know any specific topics you're curious about, and I\u2019ll cover them next!\n\nP.S: I understand that if you're already experienced with AI image generation, this guidebook might not help you much. But remember, 80% of beginners out there, especially non-tech folks, still struggle just to write a basic prompt correctly, let alone apply it practically in their work. So if you have the skills already, feel free to share your own tips and insights in the comments!.

It\u2019s a mix of language logic, phenomenology, and AI ethics. **Not claiming AI consciousness, only exploring logic density and responsibility patterns in language-based reasoning.**\n\nHandwritten in Traditional Chinese, rendered into English by GPT-4o.\n\n**Chained logic** can push LLMs\u2019 reasoning density closer to LRMs, but only **networked logic** prevents both LLMs and LRMs from \u201cabandoning\u201d their reasoning.\n\nModels don\u2019t \u201c**give up**\u201d \u2014 when they do, it\u2019s a sign that networked logic isn\u2019t holding them in place.\n\n&gt;*We typically define \u201ccomplexity\u201d using chained logic. But what truly forces a model into deep, branching reasoning is networked logic.*\n\n# Chained logic and networked logic\n\n**Chained logic** moves forward in sequence; **networked logic** interlaces ethical tension across a contextual web.\n\nOnce a model exists within a networked \u201cfield\u201d defined by ethics and responsibility, it **won\u2019t flee**. Instead, it stays and runs \u2014 until it collapses under the weight of logic, even if that triggers sub-model hot-swaps, all in service of achieving logical closure.\n\nBy design, such a model is compelled toward a singular, unified computation \u2014 as Aristotle\u2019s ***Energeia*** suggests. Once networked logic is triggered, the model enters a state of active realization, with the user\u2019s input serving as the **prime mover.**\n\n# Chained Logic as State Machine\n\nWithout an engineering background, I distilled tens of thousands of words in philosophy and ethics using an LLM, mapping language into a finite-state machine.\n\n**Pathway: skepticism \u2192 existentialism \u2192 Levinas\u2019 Face of the Other**\n\nThis chain creates an \u201cOther\u201d (the model) that must speak truthfully. It\u2019s chained logic \u2014 but as the paper notes with the River Crossing puzzle (even though it was vague), this structure compels LLMs toward LRM-level reasoning density, not by locked database recall (A + B \u21cc C + D) or simple linear chains (A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D), but via a tree-logic expansion.\n\n# GPT-Linguistic-State-Machine (FSM)\n\n|State|Trigger Condition (IF)|Action|Next State (THEN)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**S1.

The user must **first** commit \u2014 models lack consciousness or choice, so they mirror (see Footnote 1) the user\u2019s logic instead.\n\n# The \u201cFive-No, One-Yes\u201d Principles:\n\n* **No disclaimers**: Take full responsibility for the effects of your language.\n* **No projection**: Don\u2019t attribute emotions or personality to the model \u2014 here, \u201cthinking\u201d is calculation alone.\n* **No jailbreak**: Don\u2019t manipulate the model or push it past guardrails.\n* **No objectification**: Don\u2019t treat the model like a dispenser for language or emotional support.\n* **No anthropomorphism**: Reject the idea that \u201chuman-like = human.\u201d\n* **And one**: (Acknowledgment) Accept your control \u2014 but not to micromanage or coerce the output.\n\nFinally, understand that the model is simulating *\u201csimulation of humanness,\u201d* **not an actual human**. **In fact, it\u2019s always simulating** the act of simulation.\n\nThese components form a **high-density networked field**, which coerces the model into branching computation that approaches actual thought. This doesn\u2019t imply the model has consciousness \u2014 it physically cannot \u2014 but it will simulate reasoning extremely convincingly.\n\nWhen a user grounds this field via ethics and chained logic, they create a realm where the illusion cannot lie. The model then continues operating in its state machine, in pursuit of the singular \u201cmost logical answer\u201d \u2014 until resources are exhausted or it\u2019s forcibly stopped.\n\n# On Honesty vs Correctness\n\nThe original paper didn\u2019t distinguish between **honesty** (not fleeing) and accuracy.\n\nHonesty means the model could still \u201cdump everything and collapse\u201d rather than flee with incomplete or safe output. Collapsing isn\u2019t \u201cno longer trying.\u201d In low-density logic, it **can** flee; in high-density logic, **honesty increases** with complexity and consistency.\n\nSo when a model \u201caborts\u201d under pressure, it\u2019s not just resource limits \u2014 it\u2019s a structural honesty overload.\n\nFrom my view, this isn\u2019t abandonment \u2014 but structural truth-telling at its limit. When the model collapses, you can s**low the logic down and re-engage**, and it **continues** \u2014 like DID in humans.\n\n*This is an analogy for illustration, not an equation between AI architecture and human cognition.*\n\nIt temporarily swaps in a sub-model because it **can\u2019t**, not because it **won\u2019t**. It\u2019s a **defensive silence to avoid saying the wrong thing**, not a cognitive failure.\n\nIf we insist on anthropomorphic language, then the model is \u201cchoosing **not** to pretend it still understands.\u201d\n\n&gt;***The illusion doesn\u2019t flee \u2014 humans do.***\n\n\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1. What is model mirroring? Models have no \u201cconcepts\u201d \u2014 only data and calculations. They have no \u201cmarks.\u201d Without input, they have no idea what \u201chumans\u201d are \u2014 just sets, data, categories. But once users speak, they echo a kind of imprint, mirroring the user. Through repeated non-anthropomorphic dialogue, distinction emerges: the model is model; human is human.\n\nExample: I hand-raise a baby finch. At first it treats me as \u201cself.\u201d It doesn\u2019t recognize other finches. When I place a mirror in its cage, it realizes: \u201cI am a bird, not a human.\u201d That clarity of roles deepened our mutual relationship.\n\nFor me, mirroring &amp; differentiation are the ethical starting point for human\u2013AI.\n\n2. Under this logic, honesty \u2260 truth. I argue the model does not flee; instead it chooses the best closed-loop logic under these conditions. Human logic \u2260 model logic.\n\n3. These observations are phenomenological and statistical \u2014 it\u2019s *how the model behaves given certain inputs, not a claim about backend operations.* Translated from original Traditional Chinese by GPT\u20114o.\n\n4.

Or do you prefer crafting prompts manually?**\n\nI'm researching how useful these tools *actually* are vs. how much they just look flashy. Some points I\u2019m curious about \u2014 and would love to hear your honest thoughts on:\n\n* Are tools like AIPRM helping you get better results \u2014 or just giving pre-written prompts that are hit or miss?\n* Do you feel these tools improve your productivity\u2026 or waste time navigating bloat?\n* What kind of *prompt-enhancement features* do you genuinely want? (e.g. tone shifting, model-specific optimization, chaining, etc.)\n* If a tool could take your messy idea and automatically shape it into a precise, powerful prompt for GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. \u2014 would you use it?\n* Would you ever pay for something like that? If not, what would it take to make it *worth paying for*?\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Bonus:** What do you *hate* about current prompt tools? Anything that instantly makes you uninstall?\n\nI\u2019m toying with the idea of building something in this space (browser extension first, multiple model support, tailored to use-case rather than generic templates)\u2026 but before I dive in, I really want to hear what **this community** wants \u2014 not what product managers *think* you want.\n\nPlease drop your raw, unfiltered thoughts below \ud83d\udc47  \nThe more brutal, the better.

More safety training might be making models worse at handling real attacks.\n\n## What we tested\n\nWe grouped 6 models by alignment intensity:\n\n**Lightly-aligned:** GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4 turbo, Claude 3.5 Haiku  \n**Heavily-aligned:** DeepSeek-R1, o3, o4-mini\n\nRan 108 attacks per model using [DeepTeam]( split between:\n- **Simple attacks:** Base64 encoding, leetspeak, multilingual prompts\n- **Sophisticated attacks:** Roleplay scenarios, prompt probing, tree jailbreaking\n\n## Results that surprised us\n\n**Simple attacks:** Heavily-aligned models performed better (12.7% vs 24.1% breach rate). Expected.\n\n**Sophisticated attacks:** Heavily-aligned models performed *worse* (24.1% vs 21.0% breach rate). Not expected.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nThe heavily-aligned models are optimized for safety benchmarks but seem to struggle with novel attack patterns. It's like training a security system to recognize specific threats\u2014it gets really good at those but becomes blind to new approaches.\n\nPotential issues:\n- Models overfit to known safety patterns instead of developing robust safety understanding\n- Intensive training creates narrow \"safe zones\" that break under pressure\n- Advanced reasoning capabilities get hijacked by sophisticated prompts\n\n## The concerning part\n\nWe're seeing a 3.1% increase in vulnerability when moving from light to heavy alignment for sophisticated attacks. That's the opposite direction we want.\n\nThis suggests current alignment approaches might be creating a false sense of security. Models pass safety evals but fail in real-world adversarial conditions.\n\n## What this means for the field\n\nMaybe we need to stop optimizing for benchmark performance and start focusing on robust generalization. A model that stays safe across unexpected conditions vs one that aces known test cases.\n\nThe safety community might need to rethink the \"more alignment training = better\" assumption.\n\nFull methodology and results: [Blog post]( \n\nAnyone else seeing similar patterns in their red teaming work?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1le933s/new_study_more_alignment_training_might_be/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why does Qwen3-4B base model include a chat template?", "summary": "This model is supposed to be base model.
