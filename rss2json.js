Existing solutions required access to my entire inbox, which felt too intrusive to me. And although Gemini exists, and Copilot exists, it didn't cover my use-cases. So I built MXtoAI as a fun personal project, and then I thought of doing it properly and making it open source!\n\nThere's a LOT of things you can do with it, but some of the things that I use it for are;\n\n\\- Doing background research: I have a startup, and I get reached out by strangers around 5-10 times a week over email. My usual next steps in such cases were to google the person, company, etc. Now I just forward such emails to [background@mxtoai.com](mailto:background@mxtoai.com) and it gives me a detailed summary! \n\n\\- Summarising my newsletters: I'm subscribed to Scott Galloway's neswetter, and Ben Thompson's Stratchery for years, I usually can't find time to read all of their issues. But now I just forward them to [summarise@mxtoai.com](mailto:summarise@mxtoai.com) (I have set up an auto-forwarding rule for this), and I at least get a chance to see summary.\n\n\\- Auto-generating newsletters: I have set up a custom newsletter where I wanted to query top open source projects launched on HackerNews in last 1 week and a brief of the discussion threads. I set it to deliver every Sunday morning at 9am my time. All I have to do was mention the instructions in email and send that to [schedule@mxtoai.com](mailto:schedule@mxtoai.com), I have another newsletter especially around the sports teams and individuals that I follow.\n\nSo yeah, I'm excited to share it here and see more people use it! (I've put too much effort now into building it haha). Like I said, it can do a lot more (like fact check promotion emails or news, export emails to pdf, run analysis on your attachments and so on), there's bunch of use-cases I tried to add in the project docs. I'm happy to know any new use cases too or feedback in general.  \n  \nYou can try out the hosted version, or self-host, we don't store any emails, and you choose what you forward anyway, so it's very secure that way!
