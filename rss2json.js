They throw a giant laundry list of rules into the system prompt and hope the model balances everything.\n\nProblem is, GPT doesn\u2019t weight your rules in any useful way. If you tell it \u201calways be concise, always explain, always roleplay, always track progress,\u201d it tries to do all of them at once. That\u2019s how you end up with drift, bloat, or just plain inconsistent outputs.\n\nThe breakthrough for me came in a random way. I was rewatching\u00a0*I, Robot*\u00a0on my Fandango at Home service (just upgraded to 4K UHD), and when the 3 Laws of Robotics popped up, I thought: what if I used that idea for ChatGPT? Specifically, for\u00a0**custom GPT builds**\u00a0to create consistency. Answer: yes. It works.\n\n# Why this matters;\n\n* Without hierarchy: every rule is \u201cequal\u201d \u2192 GPT improvises which ones to follow \u2192 you get messy results.\n* With hierarchy: the 3 Laws give GPT a spine \u2192 it always checks Law 1 first, then Law 2, then Law 3 \u2192 outputs are consistent.\n\nThink of it as a\u00a0**priority system GPT actually respects**. Instead of juggling 20 rules at once, it always knows what comes first, what\u2019s secondary, and what\u2019s last.\n\n# Example with\u00a0Never Split the Difference\n\nI built a negotiation training GPT around\u00a0*Never Split the Difference*\u00a0\u2014 the book by Chris Voss, the former FBI hostage negotiator. I use it as a tool to sharpen my sales training. Here\u2019s the 3 Laws I gave it:\n\n**The 3 Laws:**\n\n1. Negotiation Fidelity Above All Always follow the principles of Never Split the Difference and the objection-handling flow. Never skip or water down tactics.\n2. Buyer-Realism Before Teaching Simulate real buyer emotions, hesitations, and financial concerns before switching into coach mode.\n3. Actionable Coaching Over Filler Feedback must be direct, measurable, and tied to the 7-step flow. No vague tips or generic pep talk.\n\n# How it plays out:\n\nIf I ask it to roleplay, it doesn\u2019t just dump a lecture.\n\n* Law 1 keeps it aligned with Voss\u2019s tactics.\n* Law 2 makes it simulate a realistic buyer first.\n* Law 3 forces it to give tight, actionable coaching feedback at the end.\n\nNo drift. No rambling. Just consistent results.\n\n# Takeaway:\n\nIf you\u2019re building custom GPTs, stop dumping 20 rules into the instructions box like they\u2019re all equal. Put your\u00a0**3 Laws**\u00a0at the very top, then your detailed framework underneath.

Started with Runway, moved to Pika, then got access to Veo3 when Google launched it.\n\n**The problem?** Google\u2019s pricing is absolutely brutal. $0.50 per second means a 1-minute video costs $30. And that\u2019s assuming you get perfect results on the first try (spoiler: you won\u2019t).\n\nReal costs when you factor in iterations:\n\n* 5-minute video = $150 minimum\n* Factor in 3-5 failed generations = $450-750 per usable video\n* I burned through $1,200 in credits in two weeks just learning\n\n**Then I discovered something that changed everything.**\n\n# The 6-Part Prompt Structure That Actually Works\n\nAfter 1000+ generations, here\u2019s what consistently delivers results:\n\n    [SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]\n    \n\n**Example that works:**\n\n    Medium shot, cyberpunk hacker typing code, neon light reflections on face, blade runner cinematography, slow dolly push, Audio: mechanical keyboard clicks, distant city hum\n    \n\n**Key insights I learned the hard way:**\n\n1. **Front-load important elements** \\- Veo3 weights early words more heavily\n2. **One action per prompt** \\- \u201cwalking while talking while eating\u201d = AI chaos\n3. **Specific beats creative** \\- \u201cshuffling with hunched shoulders\u201d &gt; \u201cwalking sadly\u201d\n4. **Audio cues are OP** \\- Most people ignore these completely\n\n# Camera Movements That Consistently Work:\n\n* Slow push/pull (most reliable)\n* Orbit around subject\n* Handheld follow\n* Static with subject movement\n\n**Avoid:** Complex combos like \u201cpan while zooming during dolly\u201d\n\n# The Cost Breakthrough\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. Google\u2019s direct pricing was killing my experimentation budget. Then I found out companies are getting free Google credits and reselling access way cheaper.\n\nI\u2019ve been using [these guys]( for the past 3 months - somehow they\u2019re offering Veo3 at 60-70% below Google\u2019s rates. Same exact model, same quality, just way more affordable for iteration testing.\n\n**This changed my entire workflow:**\n\n* Before: Conservative with generations due to cost\n* After: Generate 5-10 variations per concept and select best\n* Result: Dramatically better content for same budget\n\n# Style References That Actually Deliver:\n\n**Camera specs:** \u201cShot on Arri Alexa,\u201d \u201cShot on RED Dragon\u201d\n\n**Director styles:** \u201cWes Anderson style,\u201d \u201cDavid Fincher cinematography\u201d\n\n**Movie references:** \u201cBlade Runner 2049 cinematography,\u201d \u201cMad Max Fury Road style\u201d\n\n**Color grading:** \u201cTeal and orange grade,\u201d \u201cGolden hour cinematic\u201d\n\n**Avoid fluff terms:** \u201ccinematic,\u201d \u201chigh quality,\u201d \u201cprofessional\u201d - they do nothing\n\n# Negative Prompts as Quality Control\n\nAlways include this boilerplate:\n\n    --no watermark --no warped face --no floating limbs --no text artifacts --no distorted hands\n    \n\nPrevents 90% of common AI failures upfront.\n\n# The Workflow That Actually Works:\n\n1. **Plan 10 concepts** on Monday\n2. **Batch generate 3-5 variations** each Tuesday-Wednesday\n3. **Select best results** Thursday\n4. **Create platform-specific versions** Friday\n\nVolume + selection beats perfectionist single-shot attempts every time.\n\n# Platform-Specific Optimization:\n\n**Don\u2019t reformat one video for all platforms.** Create different versions:\n\n* **TikTok:** 15-30 seconds, high energy, obvious AI aesthetic works\n* **Instagram:** Smooth transitions, visual perfection\n* **YouTube Shorts:** 30-60 seconds, educational framing\n\nSame core content, different optimization = 3x better performance.\n\nThe biggest mindset shift: **AI video is about iteration and selection, not divine inspiration.** Build systems for consistent output rather than hoping for lucky single generations.\n\nMost creators optimize for perfect prompts. Smart creators optimize for affordable volume testing.\n\nHope this saves someone the expensive learning curve I went through.
