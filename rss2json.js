The qualifications then allowed them to hold lucrative positions on the boards of state-owned companies.\n\nAs well as Ro\u015bciszewski, a former member of parliament from the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party and a senior banker were detained also this week as part of the same investigation.\n\nNews website Goniec first reported that Ro\u015bciszewski was detained by Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA) officers after landing at Warsaw Chopin airport. Two other men, named only as Maks K. and Pawe\u0142 P. under Polish privacy law, were detained at their homes in relation to the same case.\n\nMaks K., a former long-serving PiS MP and former deputy president of PKO, a large state-owned bank, reportedly arranged to obtain MBA degrees for himself, Pawe\u0142 P and Ro\u015bciszewski (who has waived his right to privacy) from the Management Academy of Applied Sciences (MANS) in Warsaw.\n\nThe rector of MANS at the time was a man named by Goniec as Pawe\u0142 C., who is at the heart of an investigation into another private university, Collegium Humanum, that is accused by prosecutors of corruptly issuing MBA diplomas without recipients having to actually study for them.\n\nLast month, prosecutors\u00a0[issued the first indictments](\u00a0against those accused of involvement in the scam. Among those who will stand trial are the mayor of Wroc\u0142aw, Poland\u2019s third-largest city, two former members of the European Parliament, and a former presidential spokesman.\n\nBefore being appointed as ambassador to France in 2022, Ro\u015bciszewski worked in finance. In 2016, he became deputy CEO of PKO and in 2021 its CEO. Pawe\u0142 P., meanwhile has held various senior positions at PKO, and recently became a member of the board of VeloBank, a private Polish bank.\n\nGoniec reports that Ro\u015bciszewski is believed by prosecutors to have obtained an MBA from MANS (which was at the time known as Warsaw Management University, or WSM) without studying for it. He then used the degree to meet the requirements to sit on supervisory board of state-owned firms.\n\nAfter news of Ro\u015bciszewski\u2019s arrest emerged on Wednesday, the foreign ministry\u2019s spokesman, Maciej Wewi\u00f3r, announced that the ambassador had been relieved of his duties by a decision of foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski.\n\nMeanwhile, Ro\u015bciszewski himself issued a statement fo the Polish Press Agency (PAP) in which he said that was \u201ccooperating fully with prosecutors\u201d and had \u201cprovided extensive eplanations\u201d of his actions. Media reports indicate that Ro\u015bciszewski has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn his statement, Ro\u015bciszewski also noted that he had served on numerous boards even before obtaining a diploma from Warsaw Management University.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/26/polands-ambassador-to-france-removed-from-duty-after-being-detained-in-fake-diploma-probe/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
