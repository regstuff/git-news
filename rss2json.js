However, a\u00a0[diplomatic breakthrough](\u00a0last year led to the resumption of exhumations, which had previously been banned by Ukraine.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s culture ministry and Poland\u2019s state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) announced that the Ukrainian authorities had approved a request from the IPN to search for burial sites in the depopulated former village of Huta Peniatska (Huta Pieniacka in Polish).\n\nThe village had been part of Poland before the war but is now in western Ukraine. According to the IPN, on 28 February 1944, Ukrainian members of the Nazi Waffen-SS together with a unit of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) carried out a \u201cpacification operation\u201d there that resulted in the deaths of around 850 people.\n\nThe Ukrainian culture ministry says that a joint Polish-Ukrainian will search for burial sites. \u201cIf remains are discovered, the work will continue in the form of exhumation with subsequent reburial,\u201d they added, saying that Ukraine \u201cemphasises the importance of honouring the dead and preserving their memory\u201d.\n\nThe news was welcomed by a spokesman for Polish President Karol Nawrocki, who said that the permission had granted thanks to Nawrocki raising the issue during a\u00a0[meeting](\u00a0with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, in December.\n\nAfter lifting its ban last year, Ukraine\u00a0[gave permission](\u00a0for the exhumation of victims in the depopulated former village of Puzhnyky (Pu\u017aniki in Polish). The\u00a0[remains of at least 42 people](\u00a0were subsequently discovered, and in September were\u00a0[reburied](\u00a0in a ceremony attended by the Polish and Ukrainian culture ministers.\n\nIn October, Ukraine\u00a0[granted permission](\u00a0for exhumation in the former Polish village of Ug\u0142y, and then in December for exhumations in\u00a0[three other locations](\n\nIn 2022, the IPN estimated that the remains of around 55,000 ethnic Polish victims and 10,000 Jewish ones \u201cstill lie in death pits in Volhynia, waiting to be found, exhumed, and buried\u201d.\n\nHowever, from 2017 until last year, Ukraine imposed a ban on searches for massacre victims on its territory in response to the dismantlement of a UPA monument in Poland.\n\nPoland has\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0the fact that many in Ukraine still venerate the UPA and individuals seen as responsible for the Volhynia massacres. Meanwhile, Ukraine\u00a0[rejects](\u00a0Poland\u2019s position that the massacres constituted a genocide.\n\nEarlier this month, the IPN\u00a0[condemned](\u00a0the head of its Ukrainian counterpart after he called the Volhynia massacres part of a \u201cPolish grand narrative\u201d and said that, in Ukraine, they are regarded merely as a \u201clocal historical episode\u201d. He also suggested they did not constitute genocide.\n\nThe dispute over the massacres is more than just symbolic. In 2024, a Polish deputy prime minister\u00a0[said](\u00a0that Poland would not allow Ukraine to be admitted to the European Union until the two countries \u201cresolve\u201d their differences over Volhynia.\n\nThat position was also expressed last year by Nawrocki, who, while campaigning for the presidency,\u00a0[said](\u00a0that he \u201ccurrently does not envision Ukraine in either the EU or NATO until important civilisational issues for Poland are resolved\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/20/ukraine-permits-further-searches-for-polish-victims-of-wwii-massacres/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland tightens cybersecurity rules targeting non-NATO suppliers", "summary": "", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/21/poland-tightens-cybersecurity-rules-targeting-non-nato-suppliers/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'He just wanted to go home' \u2014 Brazilian recruit\u2019s death in Ukraine points to torture, abuse in foreign fighter unit", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-brazilian-recruits-death-in-ukraine-points-to-abuse-torture-in-foreign-fighter-unit/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
