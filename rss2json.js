However, recent work demonstrates that even the best models struggle to identify when and where to refine without access to external feedback. Outcome-based Reward Models (ORMs), trained to predict correctness of the final answer indicating when to refine, offer one convenient solution for deciding when to refine. Process Based Reward Models (PRMs), trained to predict correctness of intermediate steps, can then be used to indicate where to refine. But they are expensive to train, requiring extensive human annotations. In this paper, we propose **Stepwise ORMs** (**SORMs**) which are trained, only on synthetic data, to approximate the expected future reward of the optimal policy or *V*^\u22c6. More specifically, SORMs are trained to predict the correctness of the final answer when sampling the current policy many times (rather than only once as in the case of ORMs). Our experiments show that SORMs can more accurately detect incorrect reasoning steps compared to ORMs, thus improving downstream accuracy when doing refinements. We then train global refinement models, which take only the question and a draft solution as input and predict a corrected solution, and local refinement models which also take as input a critique indicating the location of the first reasoning error. We generate training data for both models synthetically by reusing data used to train the SORM. We find combining global and local refinements, using the ORM as a reranker, significantly outperforms either one individually, as well as a best of three sample baseline. With this strategy we can improve the accuracy of a LLaMA-2 13B model (already fine-tuned with RL) on GSM8K from 53% to 65% when greedily sampled.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1c8fp1k/glore_when_where_and_how_to_improve_llm_reasoning/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Study reveals new insights into wreck of royal flagship Gribshunden of Hans (John), King of Denmark, which after a large explosion in 1495, sank at anchor near the town of Ronneby, Sweden", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.heritagedaily.com/2024/04/study-reveals-new-insights-into-wreck-of-royal-flagship-gribshunden/151610", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Chadian air force chief orders Washington to halt all activities at army base, letter shows", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/chad-air-force-chief-orders-us-halt-activities-army-base-letter-shows-2024-04-19/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - jy95/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin: JSON Schema viewer in Docusaurus", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/jy95/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Running pure python code parallelly in a single CPython process through sub-interpreters", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/RishiRaj22/PythonParallelism/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "French retailers must display \u2018shrinkflation\u2019 information ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.just-food.com/news/france-to-bring-in-shrinkflation-bill-for-retailers/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany's Baerbock angry over public reports about row with Netanyahu", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/germanys-baerbock-angry-over-public-135002692.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\"Unprecedented\" Ancient Monument Discovered In France Sparks Mystery | IFLScience", "summary": "Unprecedented?", "link": "https://www.iflscience.com/unprecedented-ancient-monument-discovered-in-france-sparks-mystery-73837", "author": "None"}, {"title": "To Fight \u2018Shrinkflation,\u2019 France Will Force Retailers to Warn Shoppers", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/business/france-economy-food-prices-shrinkflation.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "What to know ahead of this year\u2019s London Marathon", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">What to know ahead of this year\u2019s London Marathon</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvc3BvcnQvbG9uZG9uLW1hcmF0aG9uLTIwMjQtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBRmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvc3BvcnQvbG9uZG9uLW1hcmF0aG9uLTIwMjQtc3B0LWludGw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-20", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Armand Duplantis breaks pole vault world record for eighth time, soaring to 6.24 meters", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Armand Duplantis breaks pole vault world record for eighth time, soaring to 6.24 meters</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2VkaXRpb24uY25uLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA0LzIwL3Nwb3J0L2FybWFuZC1kdXBsYW50aXMtYnJlYWtzLXBvbGUtdmF1bHQtd29ybGQtcmVjb3JkLWZvci1laWdodGgtdGltZS1zb2FyaW5nLXRvLTYtMjQtbWV0ZXJzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA0LzIwL3Nwb3J0L2FybWFuZC1kdXBsYW50aXMtYnJlYWtzLXBvbGUtdmF1bHQtd29ybGQtcmVjb3JkLWZvci1laWdodGgtdGltZS1zb2FyaW5nLXRvLTYtMjQtbWV0ZXJz?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-20", "author": "None"}]}}};
