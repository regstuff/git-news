It should then invest that $50 billion in GE with the condition that GE establishes a new, dedicated for India plant in some swing state in the US - and buy 1,000 engines in a flyaway condition over a 5 year period.     \n  \nWhy? The US and China produce ~200 aircraft a year or thereabouts. India produces (or aims to produce) 25 a year. Our ideal squadron strength philosophy is also flawed:   \n  \n- we should have a squadron strength of at least 60-70 squadrons, including one or two dedicated just for our lovely delulu friends to the east, apart from Pakistan and China.    \n- I think all 60-70 squadrons should be indigenous. We can use the Sukhois and the Rafales as well, but we need to be able to be ready to engage in conflicts with fully indigenous combat aircraft alone. The imports can add to this but not be a backbone.      \n  \nIn order to hit this very ambitious and deluded number, we need to appease Trump (or Macron, with an equivalent investment in France). No one will simply hand over engine tech to India, India will not risk reverse engineering this (and that takes time) and we're too behind on R&amp;D to do this on our own.
