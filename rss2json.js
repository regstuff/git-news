But the context must be split so the AI can process it step\u202fby\u202fstep. If you\u2019ve ever experienced AI not doing everything you tell it to, split the tasks.\n\nIf I want to prompt content to post on LinkedIn, I\u2019ll start by prompting a content strategy that fits my LinkedIn profile.

Give it examples.**  \n  \nIf you want AI to generate content that sounds like you, give it examples of how you sound. I\u2019ve been ghostwriting for my founder for a month, maintaining a 30\u202f-\u202f50\u202f% open rate.\n\nAfter drafting the content in my own voice, I give AI her 3\u202f-\u202f5 most recent posts and tell it to rewrite my draft in her tone of voice.

I'm making this post after testing out the new notes feature for a couple days, in the hopes it might reach the devs ears. I've been looking forward to it, as it's been on the roadmap for quite a while. Although I know it's still in beta, I found myself quite disappointed with the limited scope of features, many of which are contrary to the precise control and freedom that OpenWebUI gives elsewhere. I want to make clear that I love the concept and versatility of the project, and I'm grateful to the devs and community for their great work! That said, the notes functionality needs serious work if it's going to compete with the likes of Evernote, OneNote, and Obsidian.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my suggestions on how to improve the notes app.\n\n**Core Note Features:**\n\n* Notes sections: Currently, notes are only filterable by \"Today\", \"Tommorow\" ETC. It should be possible to create sections like \"Work Notes\", \"Bio Class\", \"Documentation\", with simple and intuitive visual separation. This does not mean folder icons, as those add extra difficulty in finding what you want, but rather collapsible sections or something similar.\n* Tabbed notes: It's currently only possible to reference one note at a time, but this makes it difficult to copy/paste or cross-reference different notes. Tabbed notes would resolve this problem.\n* A notes side bar: Currently, when in the notes section, the side bar is still present, but only used for the previous chats section. Why not simply put an alphabetical list of the notes by section in the side bar when in the notes mode for easy access?\n* Notes filters: Why not allow users to view their notes list by alphabetical order, recency, and so on?\n* Universal Search: Currently, using the search bar for chats doesn't bring up any results for notes. Why not unify the search experience and allow searching for both chats and notes?\n* Auto-Tagging: Currently, OpenWebUI allows the AI to generate titles and tags for chats automatically. Why not also automatically generate tags for notes to make sorting and searching even easier?\n* Font style and sizing: The current font size and style is a bit difficult to read, as it is small. It would be best to change this to maximize readability\n* Mass Import: It would be good to add an import button and a mass import function that allows one to import an entire directory to make switching as easy as possible\n* Markdown Editing: Currently, markdown rendering is a bit weird, with no real way to change the size of a header, or unbold something. Why not show the markdown icons around the text, and allow them to be freely edited, similar to Obsidian?\n* Advanced Markdown: I'm not sure which spec of markdown is being used, but it doesn't seem to support some tags, like checkboxes. It might be a good idea to include more advanced markdown functionality.\n* Character/Word/Token counts: Good notes apps usually have precise counts so that the user knows how long their notes are. OpenWebUI can leverage it's unique position as an AI app, and provide token counts as well.\n\n**Core AI Features:**\n\n* Variable command editing: Currently, when in notes, there is only a single button, \"enhance\" which automatically rewrites the whole page. The prompt it uses is completely opaque, and the placement of the button is out of the way and unintuitive. This is inconsistent and antithetical to OpenWebUI's existing design philosophy of freedom and precise control. Instead of this system, when a section is highlighted and right clicked, it brings up a context menu with multiple simple options, like \"Summarize\", \"Correct spelling and grammar\", \"Make more detailed\", \"Reformat\", etc. This menu would be fully customizable, with the ability to add as many custom commands as one would like, and even remove or rewrite the default ones. This allows the users to have ultimate control and only be limited by their own prompt engineering skills. Furthermore, the ability to only rewrite a specific part of the text is crucial for writers and notetakers. It is also in line with OpenWebUI's existing highlight menu with \"Ask\" and \"Explain\".\n* Transcription Settings: Currently, it seems like the transcription feature of the voice notes uses the local copy of faster-whisper, which is great, but there are currently no ways to configure the model being used. While users might prefer a lighter model like whisper small for real-time dictation, when transcribing a critical business meeting afterwards, they might need the highest accuracy they can get, whisper large. Instead of just setting one model and rolling with it, it would be great if there was a small dropdown menu that allowed the user to pick a whisper model from the ones they have installed. Additionally, the ability to manually pick the language of transcription may also be helpful.\n* Video Transcription: Since most meetings are recorded as videos, it would greatly reduce friction if video files could be converted to audio and transcribed seamlessly.\n* RAG access: It would be very useful if you could reference your notes in the chat section by automatically treating them as a knowledge base automatically. Automatically vectorizing them 30 seconds after the user has finished editing them should make this process seamless.\n\n**Extra Functionality:**\n\n* Links: It would be a great feature if you could link notes to other notes. If done manually, this could be done using the double square bracket syntax like obsidian. However, if done using a multi-step process, it should be possible to automatically extract related words and create a knowledge graph. In which case, a graph view to go with it would also be great.\n* Criticism mode: It would be great if there was a toggle in which you could have an LLM fully review and give constructive criticism of your notes/essays without changing anything, as comments on the side.\n* Auto-Backup: To prevent massive loss of data from a botched docker command and the like, there should be a setting to automatically backup notes to a directory outside the docker volume\n* Auto-Sync Knowledge Bases: It would be great if in the knowledge base section you could set a directory to auto-sync at a certain interval, like 30 seconds, 5 min, 1 day, ETC. Currently you have to use a python script and the API to do this, or hit sync manually, which is terrible for frequently updated information.\n* To-Do List: It would be great if you could use the transcription feature to dictate what you have to do, then use function calling to create tasks and subtasks in an organized structure. This could be integrated with functionality similar to OpenAI's Scheduled Tasks, sending a prompt to the model at the correct time to send you a notification or even execute agentic behavior using tool calling.\n\nThat's the comprehensive list. I know one of the extras isn't related to notes, but forgive that. The extras section aren't strictly necessary, but they are all features that would give OpenWebUI a competitive edge. In case someone asks why I don't implement these features myself, I am a complete beginner to programming, and have nowhere near the skill to properly contribute, or I would like to. I know this is a lot of feedback, but I believe that a lot of these are reasonably small tweaks that would have a very big effect, propelling OpenWebUI to feature parity with big note apps like OneNote, Obsidian, ETC, while taking advantage of its' unique strengths as an AI app. I hope this reaches the devs, and I'd like to again give my thanks for all they do!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1klznzg/notes_feature_suggestions/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Embedded database CrossDB supports auto data expiring with TTL feature", "summary": "This feature is similar with [TiDB TTL]( which is similar with [Mongo DB TTL index]( and [Redis Expire command](\n\nYou can use [CrossDB TTL]( to implement mac table aging easily.", "link": "https://github.com/crossdb-org/CrossDB", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK ranked second worst in western Europe for LGBT+ laws", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thenational.scot/news/25160667.uk-ranked-second-worst-western-europe-lgbt-laws/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Controversial take: selling becomes more important than building (AI products)", "summary": "Naval Ravikant said it best: \u201cLearn to sell.

But this is not about religion. This is about three politically fragile states trying to stay relevant by backing each other\u2019s delusions.\n\nEach member of this so-called brotherhood is a case study in democratic decay. Pakistan is a military puppet show. Turkey is a strongman state where dissent has been criminalised. Azerbaijan is a thinly veiled monarchy ruled by the same family for decades. None of them has a functioning democratic system or a credible reputation internationally.\n\nWhat unites them is failure. They feed their populations a steady diet of nationalism to cover up domestic incompetence. Pakistan talks endlessly about Kashmir while its economy collapses. Turkey talks about Islamic unity while jailing journalists. Azerbaijan waves war flags to distract from corruption and repression.\n\nTogether, they manufacture theatre. They conduct joint military drills, issue coordinated statements and celebrate each other\u2019s pet causes. Turkey cheers Pakistan on Kashmir. Pakistan refuses to recognise Armenia. Azerbaijan returns the favour at international forums. This is not strategy. It is mutual self-delusion.\n\nBut there is a more serious dimension. China quietly benefits from this toxic triangle. These three provide a soft buffer that helps Beijing undermine India\u2019s influence, obstruct international consensus, and insert pressure points across South and Central Asia. The longer this alliance appears united, the easier it is for China to play behind the curtain.\n\nThis so-called trinity is not inevitable. It can be challenged. With firm regional partnerships, tighter diplomatic messaging, and public exposure of their hypocrisy, their fragile posturing can be punctured. India, along with its allies, needs to stop treating them as noisy irritants and start showing them as the hollow actors they are.\n\nThis is not a coalition of strength. It is a confederation of crutches.
