I remember people praying for some statues to be replicas (which ended up not being) and thanking the French for the Cour Khorsabad in the Louvre.\n\nOr if we started to talk about the destruction of UNESCO World Heritage sites in recent years due to the syrian civil war or the Iraqi conflicts that unfortunately never seem to end\u2026\n\nEgypt still does not enjoy neither of a democratic government nor of a consolidated state of peace.\n\nNot to mention the never-ending Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nThe whole Middle East is not a pacific region.
