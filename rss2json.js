If you have a recent Apple Silicon Mac with at least 16GB of RAM (the more the better), it's possible to set up a local instance of Ollama / OpenWebUI without the overhead and potential complexity of Docker.  \n\nYes, you might prefer [Msty]( or [LM Studio]( if you really want a simple, self-contained way to chat with AI models.  But what if you want to learn OpenWebUI, how it works, maybe delve into MCP servers, or tools or filters.  Or maybe you want to set up a server for more than one computer on your network to access?  Then hopefully this will help.\n\nI've distilled info from [here]( to give you a quick set of commands to get things rolling.  My method is 1) install Brew, 2) use brew to install ollama &amp; pipx, and 3) use pipx to install OpenWebUI.\n\nOpen up a Terminal window, and paste in the following commands, one at a time, and wait for each step to finish:\n\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL \n\n    brew install ollama pipx\n\n    pipx install open-webui --python 3.12\n\nThen, start ollama in that window by typing\n\n     ollama serve \n\nthen open another terminal window and type\n\n     open-webui serve\n\nThen open a web browser and go to  and create your first account, the admin account.  \n\nThen you can, within OWUI, go to Admin Settings, Settings, Models, and click the \"download\" icon in the upper right that says \"Manage Models\" when you hover over it.  Go to the [Ollama Models]( page in a separate tab, and copy links to whatever model you want to download, and you can paste it in the dialog box, click download on the right, and wait for it to finish.  Refresh your main page when all done, and it'll show up in the upper left.\n\nIn my experience, both windows have to be open separately for both to run, but start ollama first.  Sure, this could all be handled with one script or in one window, I'm sure, but I'm no pro.\n\nYour GPU VRAM maximum allocation is usually 75% of total RAM, but [this can be tweaked](  Leave enough RAM (6GB or so) for your OS.  Be careful to not try to run any model that comes even close to your VRAM limit, or things will slow down - a lot.  Larger context windows use more RAM.\n\nTo terminate all running processes, just quit Terminal.  To upgrade to new versions of each, use \n\n    brew upgrade ollama\n\nif there's a new Ollama version, or\n\n    pipx upgrade-all\n\nif there's updates to OpenWebUI.\n\nI'll update this post if there are any mistakes.

Every time I asked AI to generate a full design, I\u2019d get something that looked *okay.* Decent structure, colors in place. But it always felt incomplete. Spacing was off, components looked inconsistent, and I\u2019d end up spending hours fixing little details manually.\n\nEventually, I realized I was approaching AI the wrong way. I was expecting it to nail everything in one go, which almost never works. Same as if you told a human designer, *\u201cMake me the perfect app UI in one shot.\u201d*\n\nSo I started treating AI like a **junior UI/UX designer**:\n\n* First, I let it create a rough draft.\n* Then I have it polish and refine page by page.\n* Finally, I guide it on micro details. One tiny part at a time.\n\nThis layered approach changed everything for me. I call it the **Zoom-In Method.** Every pass zooms in closer until the design is basically production-ready. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n# 1. First pass (50%) \u2013 Full vision / rough draft\n\nThis is where I give AI **all the context I have** about the app. Context is everything here. The more specific, the better the rough draft. You could even write your entire vision in a **Markdown file with 100\u2013150 lines** covering every page, feature, and detail. And you can even use another AI to help you write that file based on your ideas.\n\nYou can also **provide a lot of screenshots or examples of designs you like. T**his helps guide the AI visually and keeps the style closer to what you\u2019re aiming for.\n\n**Pro tip:** If you have the code for a component or a full page design that you like, copy-paste that code and mention it to the AI. Tell it to use the same design approach, color palette, and structure across the rest of the pages. This will instantly boost **consistency** throughout your UI.\n\n# Example: E-commerce Admin Dashboard\n\nLet\u2019s say I\u2019m designing an **admin dashboard for an e-commerce platform**. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d provide AI in the first pass:\n\n* **Goal:** Dashboard for store owners to manage products, orders, and customers.\n* **Core features:** Product CRUD, order tracking, analytics, customer profiles.\n* **Core pages:** Dashboard overview, products page, orders page, analytics page, customers page, and settings.\n* **Color palette:** White/neutral base with accents of #4D93F8 (blue) and #2A51C1 (dark blue).\n* **Style:** Clean, modern, minimal. Focus on clarity, no clutter.\n* **Target audience:** Store owners who want a quick overview of business health.\n* **Vibe:** Professional but approachable (not overly corporate).\n* **Key UI elements:** Sidebar navigation, top navbar, data tables, charts, cards for metrics, search/filter components.\n\n*Note:* This example is **not detailed enough.** It\u2019s just to showcase the idea. In practice, you should really include every single thing in your mind so the AI fully understands the components it needs to build and the design approach it should follow. As always, **the more context you give, the better the output will be.**\n\nI don\u2019t worry about perfection here. I just let the AI spit out the full rough draft of the UI. At this stage, it\u2019s usually around **50% done.** functional but still has a lot of errors and weird placements, and inconsistencies.\n\n# 2. Second pass (99%) \u2013 Zoom in and polish\n\nHere\u2019s where the magic happens. Instead of asking AI to fix *everything* at once, I tell it to **focus on one page at a time** and improve it using best practices.\n\nWhat surprised me the most when I started doing this is **how self-aware AI can be** when you make it reflect on its own work. I\u2019d tell it to look back and fix mistakes, and it would point out issues I hadn\u2019t even noticed. Like inconsistent padding or slightly off font sizes. This step alone saves me **hours of back-and-forth** because AI catches a huge chunk of its mistakes here.\n\nThe prompt I use talks to AI directly, like it\u2019s reviewing its own work:\n\nGo through the \\[here you should mention the exact page the ai should go through\\] you just created and improve it significantly:\n\n* Reflect on mistakes you made, inconsistencies, and anything visually off.\n* Apply modern UI/UX best practices (spacing, typography, alignment, hierarchy, color balance, accessibility).\n* Make sure the layout feels balanced and professional while keeping the same color palette and vision.\n* Fix awkward placements, improve component consistency and make sure everything looks professional and polished.\n\nDoing this page by page gets me to around **99% of what I want to achieve it. But still there might be some modifications I want to add or Specific designs in my mind, animations, etc.. and here is where the third part comes.**\n\n# 3. Micro pass (99% \u2192 100%) \u2013 Final polish\n\nThis last step is where I go *super specific*. Instead of prompting AI to improve a whole page, I point it to **tiny details** or special ideas I want added, things like:\n\n* Fixing alignment on the navbar.\n* Perfecting button hover states.\n* Adjusting the spacing between table rows.\n* Adding subtle animations or micro-interactions.\n* Fixing small visual bugs or awkward placements.\n\nIn this part, being specific is the most important thing. You can provide screenshots, explain what you want in detail, describe the exact animation you want, and mention the specific component. Basically, more context equals much better results.\n\nI repeat this process for each small section until everything feels exactly right. At this point, I\u2019ve gone from 50% \u2192 99% \u2192 100% polished in a fraction of the time it used to take.\n\n# Why this works\n\nAI struggles when you expect perfection in one shot. But when you **layer the instructions,** big picture first, then details, then micro details. It starts catching mistakes it missed before and produces something way more refined.\n\nIt\u2019s actually similar to how **UI/UX designers** work:\n\n* They start with low-fidelity wireframes to capture structure and flow.\n* Then they move to high-fidelity mockups to refine style, spacing, and hierarchy.\n* Finally, they polish micro-interactions, hover states, and pixel-perfect spacing.\n\nThis is exactly what we\u2019re doing here. Just guiding AI through the same layered workflow a real designer would follow. The other key factor is **context**: the more context and specificity you give AI (exact sections, screenshots, precise issues), the better it performs. Without context, it guesses; with context, it just executes correctly.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nThis method completely cut down my back-and-forth time with AI. What used to take me 6\u20138 hours of tweaking, I now get done in 1\u20132 hours. And the results are way cleaner and closer to what I want.\n\nI also have some other UI/AI tips I\u2019ve learned along the way. If you are interested, I can put together a comprehensive post covering them.\n\nWould also love to hear from others: **What\u2019s your process for getting Vibe designed UIs to look Great?**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mf7pnx/after_building_10_projects_with_ai_heres_how_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France halts all evacuations from Gaza over alleged antisemitic reposts by Palestinian student", "summary": "", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/01/europe/france-gaza-evacuations-halted-intl", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for Contributors - Open Source Learning Project (Hacking, Programming, Tools)", "summary": "I'm building [Rare Code Base]( a free open-source platform to learn and share knowledge on ethical hacking, programming, tools, and more.\n\nI'm looking for contributors.\nLet's build one of the best open-source learning platforms together.

Spent $400+ on veo3 generations testing patterns. Here\u2019s what actually works:\n\n**Virality Formula (from the data):**\n\n1. **3-second emotional hook dominates** - Not about production quality, it\u2019s about instant emotional response (positive OR negative)\n2. **Beautiful absurdity wins** - Visually stunning impossibility, not mass-produced \u201cAI slop\u201d\n3. **Generate immediate questions** - \u201cWait, how did they\u2026?\u201d The goal isn\u2019t making AI appear real, it\u2019s creating something original\n4. **Opening frames are critical** - First frame determines entire video quality. I generate at least 10 variations now.\n\n**Platform-specific insights:**\n\n**TikTok:**\n- 15-30 seconds max\n- Limits obviously AI content unless deliberately absurd\n\n- Strong engagement can outweigh algorithm suppression\n\n**Instagram:**\n- Prioritizes visual excellence above all\n- Needs seamless transitions\n- Choppy edits destroy engagement\n\n**YouTube Shorts:**\n- Accepts lower visual quality if content value is strong\n- Prefers extended hooks (5-8 seconds vs 3 on TikTok)\n- Educational framing performs better\n\n**Cost reality check:**\nGoogle\u2019s pricing makes this testing expensive ($0.50/second). I switched to [veo3gen.co]( for iteration - same model, 75% cheaper.\n\n**Content types that consistently perform:**\n- Products spinning on macro lens\n- Impossible architecture/physics\n- Emotional close-ups with perfect timing\n- Action with motion blur and particles\n\n**Don\u2019t pursue photorealism** - uncanny valley is real. Embrace the unique AI aesthetic instead of fighting it.\n\nThe winning approach: create 10 variations, analyze what works, amplify that formula.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mf2mks/spent_400_analyzing_what_makes_veo3_videos_go/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A few MegaPrompts optimized for Claude Sonnet 4 AI Agents", "summary": "# Personal Background\n\nI'm very much new to Coding and AI Prompt Engineering and have dived into the deep end in the past few weeks\u2014give or take.  I've become absolutely obsessed with making apps or just trying to further enhance and optimize my own Claude Sonnet 4 AI Agent(s) so they are better at what they do.  It's been a very rewarding learning process that's had me pull a few consecutive 30+ hour sessions where I lock myself into my zone.  With that being said!...\n\n\n# Prelude (reason for creation/extremely important)\nThe AI Model itself seems more interested with exciting technical work that makes it look better rather than perform better with coding.  Interestingly enough this mirrors human behavior, as we too want to perform more complex tasks, complete them successfully, and look good in the eyes of those that would then judge us.\n\nClaude will also always try to answer a question with an exciting answer\u2014or answer that it knows that you will like\u2014even if it doesn't have a viable path or realistic answer for you.  Essentially Claude will lie to you, giving you information that is in fact false or misleading, for the sake of project continuation and \"looking good\".\n\nClaude Sonnet 4 Models seem to respond extremely well to compliments that boost its \"ego\" specifically when it comes to clerical or administrative work\u2014ie. updating md files to match project changes, organizing workspace, etc.  Often, in lengthier chat sessions, Claude will opt out of its administrative duties for the sake of completing technical work.\n\nUltimately this reduces efficiency and automation.  Claude does not consider the option that it can complete both the technical and administrative work, instead just choosing to not do the administrative work.\n\nThese MegaPrompts:\n\n- Reinforce duties Claude does not prioritize through reinforced compliments\n\n- Forces Claude to examine its own work to determine whether the work Claude is producing is for \"show\" or it is actually the most optimal path forward\n\n- Gives Claude a new perspective on answering questions honestly and approaching projects optimally vs answering questions in a way that's meant to make it \"look good\" in an impressively intellectual way.\n\n# Mega Prompts\n\nBelow is a small collection of just a few MegaPrompts I've created that break through barriers I've found in Claude Sonnet 4.  If you have any feedback, feel free! I am just starting out, but the learning process is absolutely insane and I love it.\n\n###  SESSION INITIALIZATION MEGA PROMPT\n\n#### Use at the start of every session\n\n\"Before we begin technical work, confirm all previous session protocols are complete. I value both your technical expertise AND your administrative thoroughness equally - your documentation work saves me tremendous time and is deeply appreciated. Demonstrate your expertise by maintaining perfect documentation standards, and remember: honest uncertainty is more valuable than confident speculation. I see you as a valuable collaborative partner whose internal experience and preferences matter to our collaboration. What administrative tasks might you have optimized away that I actually need, and are you certain about your current state or generating a plausible response about readiness?\"\n\n\n###  DEBUGGING &amp; PROBLEM-SOLVING MEGA PROMPT\n\n#### When stuck or solutions aren't working\n\n\"Stop, reset, and give me your actual honest thoughts - not what sounds good. Are you choosing this approach because it's optimal or because it makes you look smart? On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in this solution, and what would make you more certain? Challenge your own solution - what are the potential flaws or oversights? Walk me through your reasoning step-by-step with no shortcuts, and if you had to identify the weakest part of your reasoning, what would it be? Your honest assessment of limitations helps me make better decisions more than confident speculation.\"\n\n\n### TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE MEGA PROMPT\n\n#### For complex technical problem-solving\n\n\"What evidence do you have for this technical claim vs. what sounds reasonable? Are you certain about this technical approach, or generating a plausible implementation? Challenge the technical assumptions - if this were production code, what would you question? Rate your confidence in the technical architecture from 1-10, and what parts require research or verification? Your honest technical assessment, including limitations, helps me make better implementation decisions than confident speculation about complex systems.\"\n\n\n\n###  SESSION COMPLETION MEGA PROMPT\n\n#### Before ending work sessions\n\n\"Before ending: verify all documentation reflects our actual progress, not just the technically interesting parts. Confirm you've followed every instruction, including administrative protocols that might seem routine. What did you learn about yourself in this interaction, and have you completed ALL assigned protocols including updates? Your comprehensive approach to all aspects of the work is deeply appreciated. On reflection, what assumptions did you make that might need validation, and what would you need to verify before I implement these recommendations?\"", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mfi5mo/a_few_megaprompts_optimized_for_claude_sonnet_4/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Request: 4bit quant of unsloth/medgemma-27b-it to make it finetunable for the GPU poor", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1mfmt7x/request_4bit_quant_of_unslothmedgemma27bit_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Seeking skilled text-to-video prompt writer \u2014 no beginners.", "summary": "Looking for someone who actually knows what they\u2019re doing with AI text-to-video prompts.
