It initially aimed to raise 1 million zloty, but that target was met within three days.\n\nThe organisers have since then upped the goal to 2 million, 3 million and now 5 million zloty. As of Monday morning, just over 3 million zloty had been raised from over 25,000 donors, many also leaving messages of support.\n\n\u201cYou will survive; you are not alone,\u201d wrote one donor, Iwona. \u201cHold on, just a little longer, we are with you,\u201d commented another, Justyna.\n\n\u201cThe response of Poles has exceeded our expectations\u2026Your solidarity is incredible,\u201d wrote the organisers. \u201cThanks to your donations, we can do much more than we planned\u2026This money will provide real warmth for people in Ukraine. We will buy more generators, sleeping bags, and fuel.\u201d\n\nThey also announced that Polenergia, Poland\u2019s largest private energy group, and the Kulczyk Foundation, a charitable organisation, have joined the initiative, donating 500,000 zloty to purchase generators.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, also expressed his country\u2019s gratitude to Poles for their support.\n\n\u201cThis is an expression of true solidarity, humanity, and sincere support at a time when warmth and light mean safety and life,\u201d he wrote in Polish on social media. \u201cWe feel that we are not alone.

Millions of Ukrainian refugees arrived in Poland, where many were hosted by Poles in their own homes. Huge amounts of aid were donated.\n\nAlmost a million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland. However, public sentiment has recently been turning against them. A\u00a0[poll published this month](\u00a0by state research agency CBOS showed that the proportion of Poles opposed to accepting Ukrainian refugees has risen to 46%, the highest level ever recorded.\n\nIn September, a United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska found that 37% of Poles negatively view the presence of Ukrainians in Poland, up from 29.5% two years earlier.\n\nFar-right political groups, such as Confederation (Konfederacja) and Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP), have also been increasingly vocal in\u00a0[stirring opposition](\u00a0to the large-scale presence of Ukrainians in Poland and Poland\u2019s financial and military support for Ukraine.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/19/poles-donate-millions-to-provide-heating-for-ukraine-amid-winter-freeze-and-russian-attacks/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "West Papua and the Genocide Mosaic", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.counterpunch.org/2026/01/13/west-papua-and-the-genocide-mosaic/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spain in shock: At least one dead and approximately 20 injured as train hits wall in Barcelona", "summary": "", "link": "https://en.as.com/latest_news/spain-in-shock-second-train-derails-after-wall-collapses-onto-train-in-barcelona-f202601-n/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel orders Gaza families to move in first forced evacuation since ceasefire \u2014 \u201cIsraeli forces ordered dozens of Palestinian families in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes [\u2026] as residents and Hamas said on Tuesday the military was expanding the area it controls.\u201d", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-orders-gaza-families-move-first-forced-evacuation-since-ceasefire-2026-01-20/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shooter of ex-PM Abe sentenced to life in prison", "summary": "", "link": "https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20260121/p2g/00m/0na/028000c", "author": "None"}, {"title": "RSF attacks Chadian army camp near Sudan border", "summary": "", "link": "https://sudantribune.com/article/309426", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Nigeria] Police boost security in Oyo community over threat of bandit attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://punchng.com/police-boost-security-in-oyo-community-over-threat-of-bandit-attack/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "President signs Polish government\u2019s budget into law despite concerns over deficit", "summary": "Opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki has signed the state budget for 2026 into law despite expressing strong reservations about the government\u2019s management of the economy.\n\nHe called it a \u201cbudget of chaos\u201d, but also acknowledged that, if he had taken the unprecedented decision not to sign the budget, it would have caused even greater uncertainty.\n\nAt the same time as signing the bill, Nawrocki also referred it to the Constitutional Tribunal (TK) for assessment. However, any decision the TK makes will be ignored by the government, which regards the tribunal as illegitimate.\n\nUnlike other bills, the budget act cannot be vetoed by the president. When it was sent to Nawrocki by parliament last Tuesday, the president had one week to decide between three options.\n\nHe could have simply signed the bill into law \u2013 always an unlikely choice for an opposition-aligned president who has regularly clashed with the government.\n\nThe second option was to sign it into law while also sending it to the TK for assessment, as was\u00a0[done by Nawrocki\u2019s predecessor]( Andrzej Duda, also an opposition ally, in each of the last two years.\n\nFinally, he could have refused to sign the budget and at the same time sent it to the TK. No president has ever taken that option, and doing so would have created weeks, and possibly months, of fiscal and legal uncertainty.\n\nLast week, Nawrocki said that he still did \u201cnot know what I will do\u201d and remained \u201copen to every possibility\u201d. However, on Tuesday evening, the president announced that he had opted for option number two.\n\nIt means that the TK has up to two months to assess the budget and issue a ruling on its constitutionality. In the meantime, the budget goes into force as normal.\n\nGiven that the TK is stacked with opposition-aligned judges, it is likely to find fault with the budget. But it will almost certainly be ignored (as it was\u00a0[last year]( by the government, which\u00a0[does not recognise the TK](\u00a0because it contains judges unlawfully appointed by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government.\n\nIn a recorded speech, the president declared that the budget is \u201cevidence of a deep crisis of credibility in the current government\u201d and \u201cdemonstrates a helpless capitulation to the challenges facing Poland\u201d.\n\nIn particular, Nawrocki criticised its impact on the level of debt, noting that it is the second year in a row in which the deficit is equivalent to almost a third of total spending.\n\n\u201cThis means that every third zloty spent comes from debt. It is financed on credit\u2026sinking the country into debt for decades.\u201d\n\nPoland has faced questions over its public finances in recent years. In 2024, the European Union\u00a0[placed Poland under its excessive deficit procedure]( requiring it to take steps to bring the deficit, which stood at 6.5% of GDP that year, to below the EU target of 3%.\n\nThe deficit in fact rose to an estimated 6.8% of GDP in 2025 but is now forecast to decline to 6.3% in 2026 and 6.1% in 2027,\u00a0[according](\u00a0to the European Commission.\n\nIn the second quarter of last year, Poland\u2019s public debt rose at the\u00a0[second-fastest annual rate in the EU.](\u00a0In the autumn, two of the big three credit ratings agencies \u2013 Fitch and Moody\u2019s \u2013\u00a0[shifted their outlook for Poland to negative]( citing concern over \u201cdeteriorating public finances\u201d and growing \u201cpolitical polarisation\u201d.\n\nHowever, despite his concerns over the budget, Nawrocki said that refusing to sign it into law \u201cwould not solve any of the problems we face\u201d but would \u201cpose a risk to the stability and predictability of state affairs\u201d.\n\nFinance minister Andrzej Doma\u0144ski has, by contrast, called the\u00a0[government\u2019s spending plans](\u00a0\u201ca budget for an ambitious and secure Poland\u201d, with a focus on \u201cinvestments in innovation, digitisation and the competitiveness of our economy\u201d.\n\nIn response to Nawrocki\u2019s decision, Doma\u0144ski issued a brief statement: \u201cThe president has signed the budget. A budget of investments and record-high defence spending. The rest, including referring the bill to the Constitutional Tribunal, is political theatre with no real consequences. We continue working.\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s defence spending, which was already at the\u00a0[highest relative level in NATO]( will now rise further to just over 200 billion zloty (\u20ac47.4 billion),\u00a0the equivalent of 4.8% of GDP, this year.
