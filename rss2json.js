My goal is to analyze the contents of these PDFs and ultimately output a number of values (which is irrelevant to my question, but just to provide some more context).\n\nThe plan I came up with so far:\n\n1. Extract all text from the PDF, remove all clutter and irrelevant characters.\n2. Summarize everything in chunks by an LLM\n   1. Note: I really just want to know the general sentiment of the text. E.g. a lengthy multi-paragraph text containing the opinion on topic X should simply be summarized in 1 sentence. I don\u2019t think I require the extra context that I lose by summarizing it, if that makes sense.\n3. Put back together the summaries (\n4. Analyse the result from #3 through an LLM\n\nI say I want to use an LLM but if there\u2019s any better-fitting options that\u2019s fine too. Preferably accessible through Azure OpenAI since that's what I get to work with. I can do the data pre-processing from step 1 with Python or whatever tech fits best.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering whether my idea would work at all and I\u2019m definitely open for suggestions! I understand that the final result may be far from perfect and I might potentially lose some key information through the summarization steps.\n\nThank you!!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1f8oec3/analyzing_large_pdf_documents/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Father created a drug to save his son from a rare disease, now other families are desperate to get it", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/father-created-drug-save-his-son-from-rare-disease-now-other-families-desperate-get", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polio vaccination targets surpassed for Gaza children, WHO says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/polio-vaccination-targets-surpassed-for-gaza-children-who-says/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How long can Macron ignore French voters?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/how-long-can-macron-ignore-french-voters/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "During the summer of 2024, Russian-installed authorities illegally deported 40,000 Ukrainian children from occupied territories to so-called \"re-education camps\" across Russia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dagens.com/news/russia-deports-40-000-ukrainian-children-to-re-education-camps", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran summons Australian ambassador over post that \u2018promoted homosexuality\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/09/04/australia/iran-summons-ambassador-over-social-post-intl-hnk", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine\u2019s FM tenders resignation ahead of expected cabinet reshuffle as new wave of Russian missiles", "summary": "", "link": "https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-minister-kuleba-resigns-intl-hnk", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Elderly Romanian woman used amber nugget worth over $1 million as a doorstop for decades\n", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-03/elderly-romanian-woman-used-amber-nugget-worth-over-1-million-as-a-doorstop-for-decades.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More than 50 killed in Russian missile strike on Ukrainian military facility", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-missile-strike-ukraine-poltava-zelenskyy-rcna169288", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Introducing Baatchit (Mern Chat ): An Open-Source, Real-Time, End-to-End Encrypted Chat Application \ud83c\udf1f", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/RishiBakshii/mern-chat-end-to-end-encrypted", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World Bank halts paid advertising on X after CBS News finds its promoted ad under racist content", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/world-bank-advertising-elon-musk-x-racism-pro-nazi-accounts/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Leader of Afghanistan\u2019s resistance movement says he will defeat the Taliban \u2018no matter the odds\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/ahmad-massoud-afghanistan-resistance-interview/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenAI Japan shares vision for much more powerful \"GPT Next\" coming in 2024", "summary": "1/ OpenAI Japan announced a new AI model for 2024 called \"GPT Next.\" CEO Tadao Nagasaki says it could be 100 times more powerful than GPT-4.\r\n\r\n2/ Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott and an OpenAI researcher previously hinted at a much more capable OpenAI model coming in 2024.\r\n\r\n3/ Reports suggest OpenAI is developing two new AI systems: \"Strawberry,\" with improved math and coding skills, and \"Orion,\" a potential multimodal successor to GPT-4 that could become \"GPT Next.\" It's trained with data generated by Strawberry.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1f82221/openai_japan_shares_vision_for_much_more_powerful/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
