For example, if I have a table of city names and I receive the strings \"Jefferson City, MO\" or \"Jeff City\" or \"Jefferson City, Miss\" I want them all to match to \"Jefferson City, Missouri.\"\n\nI first tried solving this with fuzzy matching from the fuzzywuzzy library using Levenshtein\u00a0distance and that worked pretty well as a first quick attempt.\n\nNow that I have some more time I'm returning to the problem to use some more sophisticated techniques. I've been able to improve upon the fuzzy matching by using the SentenceTransformer library from HuggingFace to generate an embedding of the token. I also generate embeddings of all the tokens in the reference table. Then I use the faiss library to find the existing embedding that is closest to the new embedding. If you're interested I can share some python code in a comment.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Have you had success with a different approach or a similar approach but with some tweaks? For example, I just discovered the \"Splink\" library when doing some searching which seems promising but my input is mostly strings rather than tabular data.\n2. Do you think it's worth it to try to fine tune the sentence embeddings to fit my specific use case? If so, have you found any high quality tutorials covering how to get that working?\n3. Do you think it's worth it to introduce an element of attention to the embeddings? Continuing the example from above I might have \"Jefferson City\", \"St. Louis\", and \"Kansas City\" all in the same document and then if I get \"Springfield\" next it would be great to interpret that as \"Springfield, MO\" rather than a \"Springfield\" in another state. My understanding is that introducing attention can get me closer to that sort of logic -- has anyone had luck introducing that in a problem like this or have a high quality tutorial to link to?\n\nI appreciate your input thank you very much!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1chuo1d/what_do_you_think_is_the_state_of_the_art/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Field School", "summary": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m starting field school in a couple weeks and gathering all my stuff.

Now, reforms can be swept through with just the vote of three quarters of legislators.\n\nBukele, a populist strongman, has already made moves that critics say endanger the Central American nation\u2019s fragile democracy.\n\nIn addition to going after critics and locking up 1% of his country\u2019s population in his gang crackdown, the leader last year also approved reforms slashing the number of seats in Congress, effectively weighing upcoming elections in his party\u2019s favor.\n\nIn February, highly popular Bukele easily won a second term in his country\u2019s presidential elections, despite the country\u2019s constitution prohibiting re-election. His party also won a super majority in Congress, effectively allowing Bukele to rule as he may.\n\nThe constitutional reform would only further allow the leader to push through his policies, including potentially carrying out more reforms to stay in power.
