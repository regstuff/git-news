The report includes placeholders that need to be filled based on the extracted information.\n\nFor context, the report follows a structured template, including statements like:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\nI need to rewrite all of those statements and merge them in the form a final, complete report. The challenge is that the placeholders must be filled based on answers to a set of decision-tree-style questions. For example:\n\n1.1 Does the organization have a climate transition plan? (Yes/No)\n\n* If Yes \u2192 Go to question 1.2\n* If No \u2192 Skip to question 2\n\n1.2 Is the transition plan approved by administrative bodies? (Yes/No)\n\n* Regardless, proceed to 1.3\n\n1.3 Are the emission reduction targets aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C? (Yes/No)\n\n* Regardless, reference supporting evidence\n\nAnd so on, leading to more questions and open-ended responses like:\n\n* \"Explain how locked-in emissions impact the organization's ability to meet its emission reduction targets.\"\n* \"Describe the organization's strategies to manage locked-in emissions.\"\n\nThe extracted information from the bills and questionnaires will be used to answer these questions. However, my main issue is designing a method to take this extracted information and systematically map it to the placeholders in the report based on the decision tree.\n\nI have an idea in mind, but always like to have others' insights. Would appreciate your opinion on:\n\n1. Structuring the logic to take extracted data and answer the decision-tree questions reliably.\n2. Mapping answers to the corresponding sections of the report.\n3. Automating the process where possible (e.g., using rules, NLP, or other techniques).\n\nHas anyone worked on something similar? What approaches would you recommend for efficiently structuring and automating this process?\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1iebu89/p_project_document_information_extraction_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Largest single-burial assemblage of beads confirmed at ancient Montelirio grave site", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-01-largest-burial-assemblage-beads-ancient.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Native Android AI Code: Achieving 1.2% Battery Per Hour Usage for \"Wake Word\" AI Models \u2013 Lessons Learned", "summary": "", "link": "/r/androiddev/comments/1icarlj/native_android_ai_code_achieving_12_battery_per/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MyTimer v2.0: A Full-featured Timer for your Terminal (+ Support Clock/Date)", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/mytimer", "author": "None"}, {"title": "primatejs/primate: Web framework focused on flexibility and developer freedom", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/primatejs/primate", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ERP in development with Laravel and Livewire", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/oitcode/samarium", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Deepseek Chat Template", "summary": "Anyone happen to have a cheat sheet or custom formatter for the new Deepseek models?

For non astro nerds, that makes it about as bright as the full moon, all concentrated into a single point. It would have been easily visible in daytime and would have lit up the night sky for weeks. Interestingly, my googling has yielded no results as to how this may have been seen from earth (hence my own rough estimation of its apparent brightness, I haven't even seen guesstimates out there). While 10 thousand years ago is a long time (it exploded 11k years ago but is about 1k light years away), humanity was very much a thing back then. Writing only goes back 5k years, what's called proto-writing about 9k, just a thousand short of hitting the mark. But cave paintings have been around for 40k years. I'm certainly not an expert on all things anthropology, my own training is in cosmology, but I'm surprised at the complete lack of discussion or even theorizing around this point. It would have been a truly spectacular event with massive and generalized cultural impact. If you had gods then you definitely started thinking up more stories about them and how they blew up the sky one afternoon.\n\nSure, more northern observers missed the show. But it's not exactly on the ecliptic so at least some people saw it both night and day, more and more guaranteed for the more southernly observers. But past that I feel like I'd be widly speculating in trying to figure out more about what impact it must have had on humanity, however minor. I suppose I'm more curious about finding resources from actual archaeoastronomical researchers about this, but there seems to be little if not 0 interest in this, even though it was the first thing that hit me when I looked at the properties of the Vela supernova remnant. So I'm very open to actual research on this if any of you have seen it, or to hear the musings of actual archaeologists on the topic.\n\nI was half hoping that a quick google search would reveal that there was an explosion of drawings of an ultra bright star around 10k years ago, but alas I've found absolutely nothing on this.
