back\u2019: Iran\u2019s women on why they won\u2019t stop flouting dress code laws", "summary": "On the streets of Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, young women are increasingly flouting the compulsory hijab laws, posting videos online that show them walking the streets unveiled. Their defiance comes more than three years after the killing of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman taken into custody by the \u201cmorality police\u201d for allegedly breaching the dress code rules. Her death led to the largest wave of popular unrest for years in Iran and a crackdown by security services in response, with hundreds of protesters killed and thousands injured.\n\nUnder Iran\u2019s \u201chijab and chastity\u201d law, which came into force in 2024, women caught \u201cpromoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing\u201d face severe penalties, including fines of up to \u00a312,500, flogging, and prison sentences ranging from five to 15 years for repeat offenders.\n\nThe authorities have also encouraged members of the public to become \u201chijab monitors\u201d through a state-backed reporting platform that allows them to report women for alleged violations.\n\nIn December, the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said the hijab was crucial \u201cto preserve the dignity of women and to restrain very strong and [dangerous sexual urges]( heralding the start of a new push to enforce the dress code laws.\n\nWithin days, the security forces intensified their hijab enforcement. The organisers of a popular marathon race in Kish Island, off the southern coast of Iran, [were arrested and accused]( of \u201cviolating public decency\u201d for allowing women to run unveiled.\n\nBut speaking to the Guardian, women in [Iran]( say public opinion has shifted and even more women are open to flouting the dress code rules despite the increase in arrests and penalties.\n\n\u201cWe never needed Khamenei\u2019s permission, nor do we need it now. The scenes you are witnessing are because we do not care what he has to say,\u201d says Hoda\\*, a Tehran-based journalist.\n\nAlthough Hoda accepts that more women will be arrested, she says the Iranian authorities would avoid mass arrests because \u201clast time they did it, they looked like fools across the world\u201d.\n\nIn Tehran, Golnar\\*, a visual artist, believes young Iranians will not return to previous norms. She recently filmed a police officer warning teenagers who were playing music; the group ignored him. She says the regime, weakened by war and sanctions, \u201cneeds good PR\u201d and cannot risk viral images of hijab arrests.\n\n\u201cDo I have it in the back of my head that I will be at any time dragged into a van? Yes, I am not going to lie. But the plan is to push the boundaries collectively, so they can\u2019t break a few of us,\u201d says Golnar.\n\nElsewhere in Tehran, Shaghayegh\\*, 22, pushes boundaries through an all-women motorcycle club. Women cannot obtain bike licences in Iran, yet her group rides weekly. \u201cThey have become very lax and don\u2019t stop us any more,\u201d she says.\n\nShaghayegh says she no longer wears a headscarf off the bike. \u201cIf I wear a hijab now, I feel I\u2019m undoing all the sacrifices so many Iranians have made. There\u2019s no going back.\u201d\n\nWhile most viral videos come from Tehran, women in other provinces also report a shift in attitudes.\n\nLeyla\\*, a business owner in the central Iranian city of Shiraz, says she has never seen the city so energised. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s really hopeful to see. The fact that more and more women choose how they dress is exactly what makes them braver. These visuals are a proof of our bravery and not the reform that many pro-regime folks are pointing to.\u201d\n\nIn Iran\u2019s northern Kurdistan region, Zerin\\*, a student says \u201cmorality police\u201d presence is minimal but broader targeting continues. \u201cIn Kurdistan we are targeted by the authorities for our Kurdish identity and hijab isn\u2019t the only concern.\n\n\u201cI fear when they start enforcing hijab in Tehran, they will use that as an excuse to make mass arrests of our men and women simply over our identity, and make up national security and spy charges like they have been doing before and after Mahsa Amini\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nSkylar Thompson, deputy director of Human Rights Activists in Iran, says the authorities lack the capacity to enforce hijab consistently and are, perhaps, reluctant to confront women amid domestic and international pressures. \u201cThe political, security, and economic climate is fragile and even a small provocation could trigger new unrest.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/24/iran-women-flouting-dress-code-hijab-laws", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Arab League welcomes Sudanese gov\u2019t peace plan presented at UN", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/24/arab-league-welcomes-sudanese-govt-peace-plan-presented-at-un", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Australian State Passes \u2018Extraordinary\u2019 Gun and Protest Laws After Bondi Attack \u2022 While the new restrictions on firearms have broad support, new police powers to crack down on some protests were criticized as limits on civil liberties.", "summary": "The Australian state of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, on Wednesday passed new laws that further restrict gun ownership and empower the police to shut down protests, in response to [last week\u2019s terrorist attack]( on a Hanukkah celebration.\n\nThe state legislation comes just 10 days after the country\u2019s deadliest mass shooting in decades, which left 15 people dead at Bondi Beach in Sydney. It is the first of a slew of actions the country\u2019s leaders have pledged in the wake of the massacre to tighten gun laws, criminalize hate speech and crack down on groups spreading extremist ideology.\n\nThe slate of laws was passed at 3 a.m. after a lengthy debate. Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales, [acknowledged]( that they were \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d that would be controversial, but said they were proportionate and necessary steps to keep the public safe in light of the attack in Bondi.\n\n\u201cSydney and New South Wales have changed forever as a result of that terrorist activity last Sunday,\u201d he [said]( at a news conference following the passage.\n\nThe new laws afford broad powers to police to prohibit and disperse protests for up to 90 days after an incident has been declared terrorism.\n\nThose restrictions were met with concern from lawmakers, activists and some [religious leaders]( that an unfair association was being drawn between the actions of the two gunmen behind the mass shooting, and the largely peaceful protesters expressing concerns about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and criticizing Israel\u2019s conduct in the war.\n\nAmong the laws passed overnight were also measures to criminalize the display of flags of groups deemed terrorist organizations by Australia, including the Islamic State, Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nIn New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, the newly introduced gun restrictions will cap the number of firearms that can be owned by one individual to four, with exceptions for farmers and others in rural areas.\n\nThe state will also audit existing gun licenses and hold a gun buyback program along with the federal government, according to Mr. Minns.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read a copy of the full article here]( in case you can't access the original for whatever reason.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/world/australia/nsw-gun-protest-laws.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Europe's relentless semiconductor decline", "summary": "The ARM instruction set and one of the early leaders in GPUs (PowerVR), came from Europe.
