I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvement!\n\n*Edit: For transparency, I'm the creator of this project. I built it for my own needs and decided to open-source it to help others.*", "link": "https://github.com/dambrubaba/google-sheet-waitlist", "author": "None"}, {"title": "BNP men hand witness in Salauddin Quader\u2019s case to police", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/bnp-men-hand-witness-salauddin-quaders-case-police-3868681", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How Palestinian first responders ended up in a mass grave in Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/04/10/how-palestinian-first-responders-ended-up-mass-grave-gaza/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India Wants a US Trade Deal With an \u2018Urgency\u2019 Not Seen Before - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-11/india-wants-trade-deal-with-us-with-an-urgency-not-seen-before?srnd=phx-india-v2", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Free Manus Invite - opened from beta", "summary": "If you want to try a new tool that has been in closed beta.
