I know that there's the memory system that's built in and the ability to reference individual chat histories in your existing chat, but has anyone put together something for auto memory across chats?\n\nIf so, what does that entail? I'm assuming it's just a RAG on all user chats, right? So that would mean generating a vector for each chat and a focused retrieval. What happens if a user goes back to a chat and updates it, do you have to re-generate that vector?\n\nSide question: with the built in memory feature (and auto memory tool from community) does that just inject those memory as context into every chat? Or is it only using details found in memory when it's relevant? \n\nI guess I'm mostly trying to wrap my head around how a system like that can work \ud83d\ude02\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1ou8rkb/cross_chat_memory_in_owui/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tim Davie resigns as BBC director general after accusations of \u2018serious and systemic\u2019 bias in coverage", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/09/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to import a chat from an Openwebui instance to another?", "summary": "I found the \"export to JSON\" menu but I can't find the import counterpart.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1ou87vb/how_to_import_a_chat_from_an_openwebui_instance/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Algiz-Linux", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Michael-Sebero/Algiz-Linux", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canadian Archaeology?", "summary": "Hey Im currently in my history undergrad considering adding a combined degree in archaeology. As Ive been studying history, i took archy classes and found that im really interested in the field. I love studying history, but jobs arent great and I dont have many plans for what to do with it outside of academia. Im on track to graduate in a year but am able to add the archaeology degree for just an extra year. It wont take much more for me to complete my second degree if i choose to.\n\nMy question is to Canadian archaeologists or Canadians who graduated with a BA in archaeology: what was it like securing a job? how many of you work in CRM and how many of you work in other forms of archaeology?\nhow is the job/life balance? is there room for career progression? \n\nMy goal was to work with government in some way or another, how feasible is that? Im not 100% sure if i love field work yet and am wondering if there are career options outside of the field. I also live in Calgary Alberta and hope to stay here for a few years for the beginning of my career. what is the job market like out here in the west? \n\nAny information would be appreciated. I am pretty sure I will pursue the archaeology degree since its only an extra year of study, but I wanted to get input on whether people think its a \u201cworth it\u201d degree. \n\ntldr: Looking to talk to canadian archaeologists or anyone with a BA in archaeology about their job experience", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ouoe3j/canadian_archaeology/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
