He argued that the measures would have threatened free speech by allowing state officials to remove online content.\n\n\u201cAs president, I cannot sign a bill that effectively amounts to administrative censorship,\u201d said Nawrocki. \u201cA\u00a0situation in which a government official decides what is permitted on the Internet is reminiscent of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell\u2019s\u00a0*1984*.\u201d\n\nThe government, which has\u00a0[regularly clashed with Nawrocki]( says that the measures would have helped protect internet users from harmful and illegal content, as well as disinformation. The bill had also received backing from Polish media and human-rights groups.\n\nThe law would have granted two state bodies, the Office of Electronic Communications (UKE) and the National Broadcasting Council (KRRiT), powers to block online content deemed, for example, to contain criminal threats, child abuse, incitement to suicide or hate speech, or which violates intellectual property rights.\n\nRequests to block content could come from users, police, prosecutors, the border guard (for human trafficking cases) or the National Revenue Administration.\n\nAuthors would be notified and, if they filed an objection, courts would review the decision. Content would be blocked only after the deadline for filing an objection had passed. Users would also gain clear channels to appeal platform removals, file complaints with authorities and restore content removed without justification.\n\nNawrocki, however, argued that these safeguards are not strong enough. \u201cInstead of real judicial review, an absurd solution has been introduced: an objection to an official\u2019s decision, which citizens must file within 14 days,\u201d he wrote on the Chancellery website.\n\nThe president acknowledged that the internet \u201cposes many threats, especially to children\u201d, and requires \u201cprudent, effective and intelligent regulation\u201d. But the government\u2019s bill contains elements that are \u201cindefensible and simply harmful\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe proposed solutions create a system in which ordinary Poles will have to fight the bureaucracy to defend their right to express their opinions. This is unacceptable,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThe state is supposed to guarantee freedom, not restrict it.\u201d\n\nNawrocki\u2019s decision was criticised by digital affairs minister Krzysztof Gawkowski, who said it would undermine online safety. The veto was \u201cnot a defence of free speech\u201d but protection for \u201cpaedophiles and scammers\u201d, said Gawkowski.\n\nHe argued that the proposed law would have strengthened users\u2019 appeal rights, protected families from disinformation and hate, and shielded Poland from foreign propaganda.\n\nThe Polish Media Council, which represents press, radio, television and online media outlets, also criticised the veto, saying that it \u201cwill hinder the fight against online disinformation, especially at a time when almost every day brings new lies from across the eastern border\u201d \u2013 a reference to\u00a0[Russian disinformation](\n\nThe bill approved in November was already softened from its[\u00a0initial version]( which would have allowed content to be blocked without giving authors a chance to respond. That drew criticism from the right-wing opposition, with which Nawrocki is aligned, but also many human-rights groups.\n\nThe version ultimately adopted by parliament addressed these concerns, winning support from human-rights and technology experts.\n\nEarlier this week, the Panoptykon Foundation, an NGO defending freedoms against tech threats,\u00a0[published an appeal](\u00a0by 132 experts urging Nawrocki\u2019s wife, Marta Nawrocka, to support the law given her previous campaigning against online threats.\n\nPoland also now faces potential punishment from the EU for not implementing the Digital Services Act.

However, each school has its own statute, in which it can place restrictions on students\u2019 attire and appearance \u2013 for example, banning certain types of clothing, jewellery, or hairstyles and colours.\n\nThat is often a bone of contention for students and parents, with some criticising what they see as overly strict rules and excessive enforcement of them.\n\nIn November, the headteacher of a high school in Krak\u00f3w was suspended following an outcry after he sent a student to a local hairdresser to have his head shaven during classes as his hairstyle contravened school rules.\n\nThat incident prompted Katarzyna Matusik-Lipiec, an MP from the centrist Civic Coalition (KO), Poland\u2019s main ruling party, to ask the education ministry about the issue. She said that the principal in Krak\u00f3w had \u201csubjected \\[his student\\] to psychological and physical violence\u201d by forcing him to cut his hair.\n\nWhile schools can set dress codes, \u201cthis does not authorise interference with elements of a student\u2019s individual expression, such as hair colour or styling\u201d, wrote Matusik-Lipiec.\n\nIn response, Lubnauer confirmed that the ministry is working on regulations that would guarantee students more freedom to decide on their own appearance.\n\nHowever, she added that it would still be required for pupils to \u201cdress in accordance with generally accepted social norms\u201d and that clothing which \u201cincites hatred, is discriminatory, violates legal regulations, or poses a threat to safety\u2026is prohibited\u201d.\n\nIn a further statement, the education ministry added that the current lack of any central regulation regarding appearance has \u201cresulted in a chaotic situation on a nationwide scale\u201d. It noted that many individual school dress codes have been found to he inconsistent with the law and overturned.\n\nThe new measures being worked on by the ministry will provide \u201cclear rules\u201d that will both respect the \u201cuniversal right of every citizen to shape one\u2019s appearance\u201d while still giving schools the right to intervene in certain cases.\n\nIt added that the recent situation in Krak\u00f3w reinforces the importance of having such regulations in place. The measures will be part of a broader bill the ministry is working on to clarify the rights and responsibilities of school students.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/09/poland-plans-greater-support-for-female-athletes-after-childbirth-and-protection-for-referees/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Brazil will cease the Argentine embassy\u2019s representation in Venezuela", "summary": "Reason:\n\n(..) There is also a message from Brazil to the government of Javier Milei.
