Would love to hear about your experiences or tool stacks that worked well for you.\n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1pc5whf/what_do_you_use_for_realtime_voiceemotion/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli settlers attack and rob Italian and Canadian volunteers in West Bank", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/01/italian-canadian-volunteers-beaten-robbed-israeli-settlers-west-bank?CMP=oth_b-aplnews_d-1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin warns Europe: if you want war, then Russia will defeat you", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-that-if-europe-wants-war-then-russia-is-ready-2025-12-02/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "European Central Bank refuses to provide backstop for $163 billion Ukraine loan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/ecb-refuses-provide-backstop-163-billion-ukraine-loan-ft-reports-2025-12-02/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gaza: study reveals unprecedented losses of life and life expectancy - Life expectancy in Gaza has fallen in 2024 to less than half of the level that would be expected without the war.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.mpg.de/25778228/1125-defo-gaza-study-reveals-unprecedented-losses-of-life-and-life-expectancy-154642-x?c=2249", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Outdoor Concerts? Uncovered Hair? Shimmying in Public? Is This Iran?", "summary": "###Young people across Iran have been leading a dramatic change in social mores in recent months. \u201cWe have a fearless young generation that is breaking taboos.\u201d\n\nThousands of young men and women, hair uncovered and dressed in jeans and short-sleeve tops, [jumped up and down, dancing and singing a]( a packed outdoor pop concert.\n\nIt is a stark contrast to just five years ago, when women could be beaten and dragged into police vans for showing a few strands of hair, security forces raided homes to break up house parties, and dancing was banned in public.\n\n\u201cThe society is changing at a very fast speed, almost like a shedding of skin. Aside from the openings we see in social space, we have a fearless young generation that is breaking taboos,\u201d Donya Amiri, a 33-year-old fashion critic and designer in Tehran, said in an interview. \u201cThe young generation wants its basic freedoms, and it\u2019s getting them through sheer perseverance.\u201d\n\nScores of [videos shared on social media]( and interviews conducted with more than two dozen Iranians \u2014 among them artists, designers, musicians, entrepreneurs, university students, as well as sociologists and political analysts \u2014 depict a country in the throes of grassroots change.\n\nPolitical dissent is still not tolerated, executions and death sentences are frequent, and security agents in early November arrested at least four scholars, economists and writers who had been critical of the system. But the government of President Masoud Pezeshkian, a cardiac surgeon who campaigned on granting more social freedoms, seems unwilling or unable to confront the tide of change and is perhaps wary of crackdowns backfiring and inciting unrest.\n\nThe government is already dealing with crisis upon crisis, including a dire economy, recovery from war with Israel, and [an acute shortage of water]( and energy resources. Dancing lifts the gloom.\n\nIt is grassroots change from a new generation of Iranians who, connected to the outside world through social media and less fearful of arrest, are testing boundaries and reclaiming public spaces from the Islamic government, long known for its stifling restrictions on mixed gender gatherings, dancing, singing, alcohol and Western-style events.\n\nFatemeh Hassani, a sociologist who studies social developments, said in an interview from Tehran that the boundaries of public and private life are increasingly blurred as young people refuse to live a double life.\n\nThe government itself has jumped on the bandwagon of the trend, if a little tentatively.\n\nIn September, it organized a series of free outdoor music events across the country called happiness concerts, inviting top singers and bands to perform for the public to cement the nationalism forged as the country responded to the 12-day war with Israel in June. The move was a first of its kind: Iran\u2019s government typically holds its celebratory events at mosques with public prayer services, not pop concerts. [The concerts were a huge hit]( with more than one million people attending.\n\nThe departure from Islamic rules has irked conservatives who have called for the judiciary and security forces to act. Iranian news media reported last week that the Ministry of Intelligence had provided the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with a confidential report on the departure from Islamic social rules and the decline in women wearing the hijab, and that Mr. Khamenei had ordered the government to bring the youth and women back in line.\n\nAnalysts say that the joy and fun on display across Iran does not mean that the young generation is indifferent to the economic problems afflicting the country or the sporadic attempts by the Islamic regime to crack down. Some of them describe the celebrations as a form of resilience and defiance, similar to [the movement led by women]( who collectively abandoned wearing the mandatory hijab following [nationwide protests in 2022]( after a young woman, [Mahsa Amini]( died in the custody of the morality police.\n\n\u201cIranian society has been able to create some cracks in the power structure by these forms of resistance and force the regime to give in to some of the events,\u201d said Mojtaba Najafi, a political analyst based in France, who wrote a doctoral thesis on political social movements in Iran.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read a copy of the rest of the article here]( in case you cannot access the original.\n\n-----\n\n##See also:\n\n* [The women throwing off their hijabs in Tehran \u2022 Social media videos of women riding motorbike and dancing in the streets in the Islamic Republic have gone viral.

They include documents relating to protections granted by a series of popes, the oldest of which was issued by\u00a0Pope Innocent III to the Teutonic Order in 1215.\n\nOthers are signed by Polish kings, including a 1349 document in which Casimir III the Great marked the border with the Teutonic Order. Another, from 1422, is a copy of the Treaty of Melno, which ended a war the Teutonic Knights had fought against Poland and Lithuania.\n\nUntil the 18th century, the documents were stored in Wawel Castle in Krak\u00f3w, the seat of Polish kings and the country\u2019s former capital. Subsequently, they were transferred to Warsaw, where by the 20th century they were held in the Central Archives of Historical Records (AGAD).\n\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939, the collection became subject to the mass looting of valuable Polish historical and cultural collections carried out by the occupiers.\n\nThe parchments were formally handed over to Nazi Germany in December 1940 and transferred to\u00a0the Prussian State Archives in K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad in Russia) in January 1941. Later, they were moved to the Prussian Secret State Archives in Berlin.\n\nPoland first made efforts to secure their return in 1948, three years after the end of the war. Those were unsuccessful, as were further attempts in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nFinally, in 2022, Poland submitted a comprehensive restitution request for the first time, including documentation relating to the looting. Last year, the Polish government\u00a0[renewed its push](\u00a0for the documents to be returned.\n\nFinally, today, amid bilateral talks in Berlin between the Polish and German governments, culture minister\u00a0Marta Cienkowska announced that the parchments would be returned, calling it \u201ca historic day\u201d.\n\nShe also revealed that the head of a 14th-century sculpture of Saint James the Elder, which was stolen from Malbork Castle in Poland in 1957 and purchased for the collection of the Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg, will be handed back to Poland.\n\nSpeaking to the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily, Cienkowska called today\u2019s restitution decision \u201cthe most important since 1989\u201d.\n\nShe said that it was the current government\u2019s move to \u201crepair relations with our neighbours\u201d, which were often strained under the former Law and Justice (PiS) administration, \u201cthat has finally allowed us not only to return to dialogue but also to shift to an offensive on restitution\u201d.\n\nThe brutal Nazi-German occupation of Poland from 1939 to 1945 resulted in the deaths of millions of Polish citizens, the destruction of Polish cities, and also the looting and destruction of hundreds of thousands of artistic, historical and scientific items held in Polish collections.\n\nMany of them remain unaccounted for, with the culture ministry\u2019s\u00a0[public database](\u00a0of works it has identified as missing still containing around 70,000 items.\n\nWhen such objects are identified \u2013 for example, in the collections of museums, archives and galleries, or when they come up for sale at auction \u2013 the Polish government seeks their return.\n\nHowever, Poland has often expressed frustration at the difficulty of restituting items from Germany.

The digital affairs ministry says it will soon complete an assessment of how this can be done, but political hurdles remain.\n\nOn 25 November, the CJEU\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0on a case brought by two Polish men who had married in Germany but found their efforts to have their union recognised in Poland rejected by the registry office and courts because Poland\u2019s constitution refers to marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\nThe CJEU deemed that this infringed the freedom to move and reside within the EU as well as the right to respect for private and family life. It ordered Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe government has\u00a0[said that it will comply](\u00a0with the ruling, but needs time to work on implementation.\n\nHowever, on Friday, the mayor of \u015awidnica, a city of 55,000 in southwestern Poland, announced that they want to begin transcribing marriage certificates of same-sex couples into the Polish registry even before the government acts.\n\n\u201cSwidnica is a beautiful, open city that rescues people from various oppressions and solves various problems,\u201d Beata Moskal-S\u0142aniewska told broadcaster Tok FM. This year, her city held its first ever Diversity Day, which included local LGBT+ groups.\n\n\u201cFor same-sex couples, a marriage transcription \\[into the Polish registry\\] is not just a formality, but also a sense of security, the fulfilment of dreams and recognition of their relationship in a fully civilised manner,\u201d she added.\n\nThe mayor admitted, though, that \u201cthere is just one problem\u201d. When entering the names of couples into the digital registry, their PESELs \u2013 Polish identification numbers \u2013 are required. But those numbers identify a person as male or female.\n\n\u201cIf we enter a PESEL number in the \u2018female\u2019 field that the system recognises as male, it simply won\u2019t let the entry through,\u201d\u00a0Moskal-S\u0142aniewska\u00a0told news website OKO.press. And, currently, marriages can only be entered into the system if they are between a man and a woman.\n\nThe mayor said that she would meet with digital affairs minister Krzysztof Gawkowski in an attempt to resolve the issue. Both politicians hail from The Left (Lewica), which is part of Poland\u2019s ruling coalition.\n\nAsked by Tok FM about the issue on Friday, deputy digital affairs minister Dariusz Standerski said that they were already \u201ccarrying out analyses on how to implement this judgment in accordance with the CJEU\u2019s line\u201d and \u201cwill have the results in the coming days\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of a week, two weeks at most,\u201d he added. \u201cWe certainly won\u2019t delay it. Because the case is important\u2026 And we pay attention to what the EU courts say and abide by those rulings.\u201d\n\nHowever, Standerski also noted that the state IT systems \u201coperate within the boundaries and on the basis of the law\u201d. So, \u201cto change something in the system, you first need to change something in the law\u201d. He said that any solution would have to be coordinated with the interior and foreign ministries.\n\nSome have argued that the CJEU\u2019s ruling will be difficult to implement because Poland\u2019s constitution defines marriage as being between a man and a woman. Others, however, say that it does not preclude the recognition of same-sex marriages.\n\nArticle 18 of the constitution states: \u201cMarriage, being a union of a man and a woman, as well as the family, motherhood and parenthood, shall be placed under the protection and care of the Republic of Poland\u201d.\n\nThe issue is highly politically charged, with many in Poland opposed both to the recognition of same-sex marriages and the idea that this can be imposed on the country by the EU.\n\nWhile The Left is a strong supporter of LGBT+ rights, including recognising same-sex relationships, more conservative elements of the ruling coalition, especially the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), are likely to be less enthusiastic about complying with the CJEU\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine trying to create regulations that would implement a judgement that doesn\u2019t fully respect the provisions of the constitution,\u201d said energy minister Mi\u0142osz Motyka, a member of PSL, quoted by the Interia news website.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk, leader of the centrist Civic Coalition (KO) party, has so far been non-committal on how his government will respond to the CJEU ruling.\n\nAt a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he said that \u201cwe will, of course, respect the verdicts and judgements of European courts\u201d. But he added that \u201cthe EU cannot impose anything on us on this issue\u201d and \u201cwherever matters must be decided by the nation state and national law, we will adhere to this principle\u201d.\n\nThe issue is also complicated by the fact that any legislative change must be approved by President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party and is ardently opposed to the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nToday, PiS deputy leader and former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki condemned the CJEU ruling. \u201cPoland cannot be a puppet in the hands of CJEU judges,\u201d he declared, quoted by the\u00a0*Do Rzeczy*\u00a0weekly.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely do not consent to Polish law being changed in any way as a result of this CJEU ruling,\u201d Morawiecki continued. \u201cLet us defend Polish families, defend Polish children, defend Polish traditions against any external interference. Sovereignty is supreme in Polish law. I would die for sovereignty.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is also possible that the government could find non-legislative ways to implement the ruling, thereby avoiding the need for the issue to go through parliament and meet an almost-certain veto from Nawrocki.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/01/polish-city-seeks-to-begin-recognising-foreign-same-sex-marriages-following-eu-ruling/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why Iran is making surprising overtures to America", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/11/27/why-iran-is-making-surprising-overtures-to-america", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cameroon Opposition leader Tchiroma Bakary flees to Gambia after contested election", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cameroon-opposition-leader-tchiroma-bakary-flees-to-gambia-after-contested-election/article70317304.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Newry, Mourne and Down: Investigation into threats made to elected representatives", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8jevd5dljo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane dies in detention", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/12/cameroonian-opposition-figure-anicet-ekane-dies-in-detention/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UN envoy Albanese accused of justifying violence against journalists", "summary": "", "link": "https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/12/in-italy-un-envoy-albanese-accused-of-justifying-violence-against-journalists/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
