What we see in ChatGPT, Claude, etc.\n10. **Tools** \\- External services or utilities that an AI agent can use to carry out specific tasks it can't handle on its own. Like web search, API calls, or querying databases.\n11. **Function Calling** \\- Allows AI agents to dynamically call external functions based on the requirements of a specific task.\n12. **Structured Outputs** \\- A method where AI agents or models are required to return responses in a specific format, like JSON or XML, so their outputs can be reliably used by other systems, tools or can be just copy/pasted elsewhere.\n13. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** \\- A technique where model pulls in external data to enrich its response and improve accuracy or get a domain expertise.\n14. **Agentic RAG** \\- An advanced RAG setup where the AI agent(s) chooses on its own when to search for external information and how to use it.\n15. **Workflows** \\- Predefined logic or code paths that guide how AI system, models and tools interact to complete tasks.\n16. **Routing** \\- A strategy where an AI system sends parts of a task to the most suitable agent or model based on what's needed.\n17. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** \\- A protocol that allows AI agents to connect with external tools and data sources using a defined standard, like how USB-C lets devices plug into any compatible port.\n18. **Reasoning** \\- AI models that evaluate situations, pick tools, and plan multi-step actions based on context.\n19. **HITL (Human-In-The-Loop)** \\- A design where humans stay involved in decision-making to guide the AI's choices.\n20. **Reinforcement Learning** \\- Method of training where AI learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties.\n21. **RLHF** **(Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** \\- Uses human feedback to shape the model's behavior through rewards and punishments.\n22. **Continual Pretraining** \\- A training method where AI model improves by learning from large sets of new, unlabeled data.\n23. **Supervised Fine-Tuning** \\- Training AI model with labeled data to specialize in specific tasks and improve performance.\n24. **Distillation** \\- Compressing a large AI's knowledge into a smaller model by teaching it to mimic predictions.\n25. **MoE (Mixture of Experts)** \\- A neural network model setup that directs tasks to the most suitable sub-models for better speed and accuracy.\n26. **Alignment** \\- The final training phase to align model's actions with human ethics and safety requirements. QA for values and safety.\n27. **Post-Training** \\- Further training of a model after its initial build to improve alignment or performance. Pretty same what's **Alignment.**\n28. **Design Patterns** \\- Reusable blueprints or strategies for designing effective AI agents.\n29. **Procedural Memory** \\- AI's ability to remember how to perform repeated tasks, like following a specific process or workflow it learned earlier.\n30. **Cognitive Architecture** \\- The overall structure that manages how an AI system processes input, decides what to do, and generates output.\n31. **CoT (Chain of Thought)** \\- A reasoning strategy where an AI agent/model explains its thinking step-by-step, making it easier to understand and improving performance.\n32. **Test-Time Scaling** \\- A technique that lets an AI agent adjust how deeply it thinks at runtime, depending on how complex the task is.\n33. **ReAct** \\- An approach where an AI agent combines reasoning and acting. First thinking through a problem, then deciding what to do.\n34. **Reflection** \\- A method where an AI agent looks back at its previous choices to improve how it handles similar tasks in the future.\n35. **Self-Healing** \\- When an AI agent identifies its own errors and fixes them automatically. No human involvement or help needed.\n36. **LLM Judge** \\- A dedicated model that evaluates the responses of other models or agents to ensure quality and correctness. Think like a QA agents.\n37. **Hybrid Models** \\- Models that blend fast and deep thinking. Adapting their reasoning depth depending on how hard the problem is.\n38. **Chaining** \\- A method where an AI agent completes a task by breaking it into ordered steps and handling them one at a time.\n39. **Orchestrator** \\- A coordinator that oversees multiple AI agents, assigning tasks and deciding who does what and when. Think about it as a manager of agents.\n40. **Overthinking** \\- When an AI agent spends too much time or uses excessive tokens to solve a task often fixed by limiting how deeply it reasons.\n\nThis should be valuable!

What eras &amp; areas do you normally expect to see textiles preserved in reasonable condition given their age &amp; situation? Do you see embellishment, such as embroidery or beading, as potentially playing any role in making fabrics more or less durable?\n\nFor instance, obviously regional climate plays a factor, but I'm more concerned with what humans do that could have made clothing and household goods more or less durable. \n\nI would naturally expect metals (like armour, chain mail, or gold threads) to be most durable, if generally least wearable/affordable for daily use, and I'd also generally expect leather and fur to biodegrade over time (or be eaten by animals, depending on how they were tanned.) Of course, I would also anticipate (again, depending on how they were tanned/treated, and where they were) that leather goods could also be among the more durable pieces. It all depends, as we know.\n\nBut beyond that, all I know is that we do have some linen and silk garments dating back hundreds and thousands of years, and while I know some were preserved thanks to, say, Egyptian royal tombs + the Egyptian climate, I'm not sure if some of the others that have survived in areas with different climates are mainly flukes (preserved due to unusual conditions) or what.
