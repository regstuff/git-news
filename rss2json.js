That would be hard for a human as well. It had input from other LLMs and 35 tools that were able to pick up some unreliable info (ofter incorrect or even hallucinated) from the audio and that is what made this challenge the most exiting and why I basically worked non-stop for the 4 weeks. A normal AI agent can be pretty sure that when it reads a file or gets some other tool input that the information is correct. It might be irrelevant for the task, but mostly LLMs trust input (which is a problem in the real word with input from web search, malicious input, another agent's opinion etc).

Andrzej \u015aliwka, a lawmaker from the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, told Republika that it showed Kosiniak-Kamysz \u201chas no idea what he is doing\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen the entire world, with the USA at the front, is moving away from \u2018woke\u2019 culture\u2026Kosiniak-Kamysz is introducing such inventions,\u201d said \u015aliwka. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for him to come up with the idea of \u200b\u200bbiodegradable missiles or electric tanks.\u201d\n\nMariusz B\u0142aszczak, who served as defence minister in the former PiS government and is now head of the party\u2019s parliamentary caucus, also commented on the issue at a press conference.\n\n\u201cToday we heard that \\[the concept of\\] gender will be introduced in the military,\u201d he said, quoted by the Interia news service. \u201cWe cannot give in to such blackmail by such irrational people, who are trying to push the United States out of Europe.\u201d\n\nWhen PiS was in power before 2015 and 2023, it\u00a0[led a campaign](\u00a0against what it called \u201cgender ideology\u201d, which is portrayed as a dangerous idea, imported from the West and propagated by left-wing groups, that undermines traditional Polish values and even threatens the existence of the Polish state.\n\nIn December 2023, a new, more liberal ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk took power. It\u00a0[promised to strengthen LGBT+ rights]( but has so far introduced no new legislation to that effect.\n\nNevertheless, PiS has criticised the Tusk administration for being more LGBT-friendly as well as for\u00a0[harming Poland\u2019s relations with the United States](\u00a0under President Donald Trump.\n\nWhen initially contacted by Blask, the defence ministry\u2019s spokesman, Janusz Sejmej, said that he was unaware of the course in question and that \u201cthis is the first time in my two-year career \\[at the ministry\\] that I\u2019ve encountered information that gender is included in training\u201d.\n\nHowever, later on Monday, the ministry announced that it had cancelled that element of training. No details of what the course would have involved have been released.\n\nThe head of the ministry, Kosiniak-Kamysz, is the leader of one of Tusk\u2019s junior coalition partners, the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), which is the most conservative element of the government and has generally opposed moves to strengthen LGBT+ rights.\n\n[**Daniel Tilles**](\n\nDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0*Notes from Poland*.

In January this year, the European Commission approved Warsaw\u2019s formal request for the funds.\n\nThe final step was approval from the Council of the European Union, made up of representatives of national governments. Today, a meeting of finance ministers issued that approval for eight member states, including Poland, after also approving eight others last week.\n\nThe decisions mean that SAFE funds have now been made available to Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Croatia, Portugal and Romania. Three other countries, the Czech Republic, France and Hungary, are still awaiting approval.\n\n\u201cThese implementing decisions will pave the way for affordable, long-term loans to be released by the commission under the SAFE instrument, demonstrating that the EU is delivering when it comes to defence,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Cypriot presidency of the Council of the European Union.\n\nThe decision was also welcomed by the Polish government\u2019s spokesman, Adam Sz\u0142apka, who wrote on social media that \u201cthe Polish arms industry will benefit greatly from the SAFE programme\u201d. The government claims that around 80% of SAFE money will be spent domestically.\n\nPoland\u2019s application for the funds includes a 300-page dossier outlining 139 projects that will be financed from SAFE. The list remains classified for security reasons, though the Polish government has said it will try to release further information to the public as soon as possible.\n\nOne particular project that is known to be among those being funded by SAFE is the development, in cooperation with Norwegian partners, of a\u00a0[new anti-drone system](\u00a0to protect Poland\u2019s eastern borders.\n\nHowever, the lack of transparency on where and how the money will be spent has prompted criticism from the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, which also argues that the EU will have the right to arbitrarily block funds if it wishes.\n\nPiS has also expressed concern that the fact that the majority of the SAFE funds must be spent within Europe could damage Poland\u2019s relations with the United States, its most important security partner and the source of much of its military hardware (as well as of\u00a0[loans to pay for it](\n\nLast week, the government\u2019s majority in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament,\u00a0[approved a bill](\u00a0that would set up a mechanism for Poland\u2019s National Development Bank (BGK) to receive the SAFE funds. PiS and the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), another opposition group, voted against it.\n\nThe bill still needs to pass through the Senate, where the government has pledged to add some amendments in response to opposition concerns. But on Monday, PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski appealed to President Nawrocki to veto the legislation once it reaches his desk.\n\nAt a press conference, he said the SAFE was created \u201cto push Europe, but especially Poland, away from the United States\u201d and to bring \u201cPoland under German rule\u201d.\n\nNawrocki himself has also raised similar doubts about SAFE, which was one of the main issues on the agenda of a\u00a0[National Security Council meeting](\u00a0he called with the government and parliamentary leaders last week.\n\nThe president has regularly clashed with the government, including vetoing an unprecedented number of its bills. However, on\u00a0national security issues, the two sides have generally\u00a0[sought to present](\u00a0a more united front](\n\nToday, Prime Minister Donald Tusk reiterated the importance of SAFE and appealed to PiS and Nawrocki to support the programme.\n\nHe said the EU-backed loans are on \u201cvery favourable terms\u201d, with interest rates almost half of those taken by the former PiS government from South Korea to purchase large amounts of\u00a0[Korean military equipment](\n\n\u201cI honestly cannot understand the motivations of those who are currently deciding to try to block this money,\u201d said Tusk. \u201cEven\u00a0if they veto it, we will find ways to save at least some of these funds, but it will take time, and it will also cost some unnecessary\u00a0money and stress.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the government\u2019s plenipotentiary for SAFE funds, Magdalena Sobkowiak-Czarnecka, likewise told news website [Money.pl]( that, even if Nawrocki vetoes the SAFE bill, the government can still sign an agreement with the European Commission to receive the funds.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/17/eu-approves-e44-billion-in-safe-defence-loans-for-poland/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
