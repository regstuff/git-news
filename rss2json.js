tiktok, instagram, youtube shorts. same content, same timing, everything identical.\n\nresults were wildly inconsistent. like same video getting 200k views on tiktok and 400 views on instagram. made no sense until i realized each platform has completely different preferences for ai content.\n\n# the platform breakdown\n\n**TikTok preferences:**\n\n* 15-30 seconds maximum (anything longer tanks)\n* high energy, obvious ai aesthetic actually works here\n* 3-second hook is critical - if they don\u2019t stop scrolling immediately you\u2019re dead\n* embracing the \u201cai weirdness\u201d gets more engagement than trying to hide it\n\n**Instagram preferences:**\n\n* smooth transitions are mandatory - choppy edits destroy engagement\n* aesthetic perfection matters way more than on other platforms\n* story-driven content performs better than random clips\n* needs to be visually distinctive (positively or negatively)\n\n**YouTube Shorts preferences:**\n\n* 30-60 seconds works better than shorter content\n* educational framing performs incredibly well\n* longer hooks (5-8 seconds vs 3 on tiktok)\n* lower visual quality is acceptable if content value is high\n\n# the mistake everyone makes\n\ntrying to create one \u201cperfect\u201d video and reformatting it for all platforms. this doesn\u2019t work because each platform rewards completely different things.\n\n**better approach:** create platform-specific versions from the start.\n\nsame core concept, but optimized for each platform\u2019s algorithm and audience expectations.\n\n# real example from my content:\n\n**core concept:** ai-generated cooking tutorial\n\n**tiktok version:** fast cuts, upbeat music, 20 seconds, emphasizes the \u201cimpossible\u201d ai cooking\n\n**instagram version:** smooth transitions, aesthetic plating shots, 45 seconds, focuses on visual beauty **youtube version:** 55 seconds, educational voice-over explaining the ai process, includes tips\n\nsame base footage, completely different editing and presentation. performance difference was dramatic.\n\n# platform-specific generation strategies\n\n**for tiktok:** generate high-energy, slightly absurd content. \u201cchaotic\u201d prompts often work better\n\n    frantic chef juggling ingredients, kitchen chaos, handheld shaky cam\n    \n\n**for instagram:** focus on aesthetic perfection and smooth motion\n\n    elegant chef plating dish, smooth dolly movement, golden hour lighting\n    \n\n**for youtube:** educational angles work incredibly well\n\n    chef demonstrating technique, clear instructional movement, professional lighting\n    \n\n# the cost optimization angle\n\ncreating platform-specific content requires more generations which gets expensive fast with google\u2019s pricing. i\u2019ve been using [veo3gen.app]( which offers the same veo3 model for way cheaper, makes creating multiple platform versions actually viable.\n\n# advanced platform tactics\n\n**tiktok algorithm hacks:**\n\n* post at 6am, 10am, 7pm EST for best reach\n* use trending audio even if it doesn\u2019t match perfectly\n* reply to every comment in first hour\n\n**instagram algorithm preferences:**\n\n* post when your audience is most active (check insights)\n* use 3-5 relevant hashtags max, avoid spam hashtags\n* stories boost main feed performance\n\n**youtube shorts optimization:**\n\n* custom thumbnails even for shorts help significantly\n* first 15 seconds determine if youtube promotes it further\n* longer watch time percentage matters more than absolute time\n\n# content multiplication strategy\n\none good ai generation becomes:\n\n* tiktok 15-second version\n* instagram 30-second aesthetic version\n* youtube 45-second educational version\n* potential series content across all platforms\n\ninstead of one piece of content, you get 3-4 pieces optimized for each platform\u2019s strengths.\n\n# the bigger insight about ai content\n\nplatforms are still figuring out how to handle ai-generated content. early creators who understand platform-specific optimization are getting massive advantages before the market becomes saturated.\n\n**tiktok** is most accepting of obvious ai content\n\n**instagram** requires higher production value **youtube** rewards educational ai content most heavily\n\n# tracking and optimization\n\nkeep spreadsheets tracking performance by platform:\n\n* content type\n* generation prompt used\n* platform-specific optimization\n* engagement metrics\n* what worked vs what didn\u2019t\n\nafter a few months you\u2019ll see clear patterns for what each platform rewards.\n\nthe creators making real money aren\u2019t just creating good ai content - they\u2019re creating platform-optimized ai content and distributing strategically.\n\nthis approach takes more work upfront but the performance difference is massive. went from inconsistent results to predictable growth across all platforms.\n\nwhat platform-specific patterns have you noticed with ai content? curious if others are seeing similar differences \ud83d\udc4d\u2764", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mwedq1/why_your_ai_videos_perform_differently_on_each/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
