At first, I honestly thought GPT couldn't understand me or offer useful help, it gave me such nonsense answers. Then I realized the real issue was that I didn't know how to write good prompts. Without clear prompts, GPT couldn\u2019t know what I was aiming for.\n\nThings changed after I found this guide from OpenAI, it helped me get more relevant results from GPT. Here are some tips from the guide that I think other marketers could apply immediately:\n\n* **Campaign copy testing:**\u00a0Break down your request into smaller parts (headline ideas \u2192 body copy \u2192 CTAs), then quickly A/B test each segment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Personally, I always start by having GPT write the body copy first, then refine it until it's solid. Next, I move on to the headline, and finally, the CTA. I never ask GPT to tackle all three at once. Doing it step-by-step makes editing much simpler and helps GPT produce smarter results.\n\n* **Brand tone consistency:**\u00a0Always save a \u201creference paragraph\u201d from previous successful campaigns, then include it whenever you brief ChatGPT.\n* **Rapid ideation:**\u00a0Upload your focus-group notes and ask GPT for key insights and creative angles before starting your actual brainstorming. The document-upload trick is seriously a game-changer.\n\n# The key takeaway is: write clearly.\n\nHere are 3 examples demonstrating why a clear prompt matters so much:\n\n* **Okay prompt:**\u00a0\"Create an agenda for next week\u2019s staff meeting.\"\n* **Good prompt:**\u00a0\"Create an agenda for our weekly school staff meeting that includes updates on attendance trends, upcoming events, and reminders about progress reports.\"\n* **Great prompt:**\u00a0\"Prepare a structured agenda for our weekly K\u20138 staff meeting. Include 10 minutes for reviewing attendance and behavior trends, 15 minutes for planning next month\u2019s family engagement night, 10 minutes to review progress report timelines, and 5 minutes for open staff questions. Format it to support efficient discussion and clear action items.\"\n\nSee the difference? Clear prompts consistently deliver better results, just like how receiving specific instructions from your boss helps you understand exactly what you need to do.\n\nThis guide includes lots more practical tips, the ones I mentioned here are just the start.
