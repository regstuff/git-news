Overlay effect: explicit scoping, fewer off-target paraphrases.\n* **No.3 Long reasoning chains** Symptoms: chain grows verbose and loses the thread.

Overlay effect: self-check and bridge steps before commitment.\n* **No.5 Semantic \u2260 embedding** Symptoms: retrieval looks ok but semantics drift in generation.
