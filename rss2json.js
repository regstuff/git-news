The first report, on how public media were used by PiS to \u201crepress and defame\u201d civil society groups and activists, was\u00a0[published in September](\n\nThe other three reports, which are yet to be published, relate to \u201clegal harassment\u201d of activists, \u201cpolice actions against protesters\u201d, and \u201cthe actions of agencies other than the police, including citizen surveillance\u201d.\n\nOne of the members of the commission is Klementyna Suchanow, who is a founder and leader of\u00a0[All-Poland Women\u2019s Strike](\u00a0(Og\u00f3lnopolski Strajk Kobiet), which led\u00a0[mass protests](\u00a0against the tightening of Poland\u2019s abortion law. They were the largest demonstrations in Poland\u2019s post-communist history.\u00a0\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, journalist Grzegorz Rzeczkowski revealed that Suchanow had been denied security clearance \u201cdue to the Internal Security Agency\u2019s (ABW) concerns\u201d about her. That means that she \u201ccannot continue her work\u201d on the commission, he added.\n\nRados\u0142aw Gruca, the journalist presenting the programme on which Rzeczkowski was appearing, said that, \u201cas a result, no one will investigate the surveillance of Women\u2019s Strike, and in my opinion that\u2019s what they were afraid of\u201d.\n\nSuchanow, who was appearing on the same show, confirmed that she was seeking to appeal the decision. In a subsequent social media post, she appealed to Tusk to take action over the issue.\n\nThe activist said that she had been denied security clearance due to an incident during the abortion protests when she had thrown paint towards police outside the constitutional court, for which she was charged with assaulting an officer.\n\nThe spokesman for Poland\u2019s security services, Jacek Dobrzy\u0144ski, however, defended the ABW\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe reasons for denying access to classified information are absolutely formal and known to the interested party,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe ABW has no possibility in such a situation to issue a \\[security clearance\\] certificate to anyone.\u201d\n\nHe also added that the decision regarding Suchanow creates \u201cno obstacles to investigating the surveillance of Women\u2019s Strike \u2013 this commission was established, among other things, for that purpose\u201d.\n\nPiS spokesman Rafa\u0142 Bochenek told conservative broadcaster Republika that the very fact someone like Suchanow was appointed by Tusk to the commission is concerning.\n\n\u201cI have the impression that we are governed by very shady people who have repeatedly disturbed public order and have displayed various acts of aggression in public space towards officers,\u201d said Bochenek.\n\n\u201cThe current government allows these individuals to function in public life. This type of behaviour is rewarded\u2026These people have a huge influence on those in power today,\u201d he added, calling them \u201cTusk\u2019s soldiers\n\nWhen PiS was in power, it regularly criticised the leaders of Women\u2019s Strike,\u00a0[accusing them](\u00a0of engaging in and encouraging illegal behaviour and threatening public health during the pandemic.

DARUI SALAAM\n\nDATE 2009\n\nSTATES\n\nNasarawa, Kogi, FCT and Niger\n\nREASON\n\nBoko Haram's violent uprising in 2009 was crushed by Nigerian security forces and Mohammed Yusuf was killed, the group fragmented. While Abubakar Shekau reorganized Boko Haram into a full-blown insurgency in Borno State, some of the less radical members and clerics broke away, rejecting Shekau's violent methods. This splinter group relocated mainly to Nasarawa and Niger States, adopting the name Darul Salam (Arabic for \"House of Peace\").\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nOperations spread across Nasarawa, Niger (Shiroro), Kogi, FCT (Abuja outskirts), and with links to Kaduna (Northwest).\n\n2. ANSARU\n\n(JAMA'ATU ANSARUL MUSLIMINA FI BILADIS SUDAN)\n\nDATE 2012\n\nSTATES\n\nBorno, Kano, Kaduna, Kebbi, Katsina and Bauchi\n\nREASON\n\nThe group split from Boko Haram around January 2012, following deep ideological and strategic disagreements with Abubakar Shekau's leadership especially they opposed Shekau's brutality and his focus on killing Muslims rather than government or Western targets.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nPrimarily active in the Northwest, particularly in Kaduna State (e.g., Birnin-Gwari LGA) and the Katsina State and Kebbi State areas bordering Niger (Benin-Niger-Nigeria triborder area).\n\n3. ALIYU NGULDE FACTION\n\nDATE 2014\n\nSTATES Borno\n\nREASON\n\nBetween late 2014 and mid-2015, as Boko Haram intensified its attacks and pledged allegiance to ISIS (becoming ISWAP in 2015), several Buduma commanders rejected Shekau's authority and broke away. These defectors formed what came to be known as the Buduma or Lake Chad Faction, operating autonomously across the islands and marshes of Lake Chad.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nGwoza Hills along the Nigeria-Cameroon border, near the Mandara Mountains.\n\n4. WILAYAT GHARB IFRIQIYYA (ISWAP)\n\nDATE 2016\n\nSTATES\n\nBorno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe and Bauchi\n\nREASON\n\nIn August 2016, ISIS publicly removed Abubakar Shekau as the leader of its West African branch and appointed Abu Musab al-Barnawi (the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf) as the new leader of ISWAP (Wilayat Gharb Ifriqiyya). Shekau rejected ISIS's decision, leading to a violent split between his loyalists (who retained the Boko Haram/JAS name) and ISWAP loyalists (who followed al-Barnawi under ISIS's command).\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nConcentrated in the Lake Chad Basin, Sambisa Forest, Alagarno, and the Timbuktu Triangle (border of Borno/Yobe). They reportedly have \"total control\" over some Local Government Areas (LGAS) like Marte, as well as bases around Damboa, Dikwa, Rann, New Marte, and near the Cameroon border (e.g., Wulgo)\n\n5. MAHMUDA\n\nDATE 2018\n\nSTATES Kwara\n\nREASON\n\nIt emerged around 2018-2019, following internal power struggles within ISWAP between loyalists of Abu Musab al-Barnawi and hardline commanders aligned with Shekau's JAS faction.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nThe leader, Mallam Mahmuda, reportedly leads a cell in and around the Kainji National Park (Niger/Kwara border). A group identified as 'Mahmuda' was specifically mentioned in a recent (April 2025) attack on Duruma village in Karonji, Baruten LGA, Kwara State.\n\n6. BAKURA DORO FACTION\n\nDATE 2021\n\nSTATES\n\nNasarawa, Kogi, FCT and Niger\n\nREASON\n\nFollowing Shekau's death, Bakura Doro, also known as Bakura Sahalaba, a senior Boko Haram commander, refused to join ISWAP and instead established his own splinter faction. This group became known as the Bakura Faction or Bakura Group, composed mainly of loyalists from the Lake Chad Basin and remnants of Shekau's fighters.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nBarwa territory along the tri-border area of Nigeria, Niger, and Chad.\n\n7. WULOWULO\n\nDATE 2025\n\nSTATES\n\nKwara and Nasarawa\n\nREASON\n\nTo extend the reach of Boko Haram beyond the North East.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Sule mentioned increasing insecurity, including killings in Kokona Local Government Area (specifically Ndama village) and abductions in Lafia and Karu Local Government Areas.\n\n\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_\n\n  \nBoko Haram's fragmentation is a complex legacy of ideological rifts and leadership struggles, producing numerous splinter factions like ISWAP and Ansaru. The recent emergence of the 'Wulowulo' faction in Nasarawa and Kwara states, as cited by Governor Abdullahi Sule, exemplifies this persistent evolution. This spread into Nigeria's Northcentral region underscores the group's adaptive nature and marks a significant geographical expansion of the security threat beyond its traditional strongholds in the Northeast.\n\nSources: SBM Violence Tracker, Media reports", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2025/10/boko-haram-as-a-hydra/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK to scrap jury trials except for serious crimes", "summary": "", "link": "https://parliamentnews.co.uk/justice-secretary-wants-jury-trials-scrapped-except-in-most-serious-cases", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
