Political leaders fear more violence could derail attempts to restore democracy.\n\nThe death on Thursday of a politically prominent student leader attacked in Bangladesh ignited a wave of unrest in Dhaka, the capital, with mobs setting newspaper offices ablaze in a nation with a shaky hold on democracy.\n\nSharif Osman bin Hadi, 32, died at a hospital in Singapore, where he had been flown for medical care. He had lain in critical condition for a week since being shot in the head on Dec. 12. As a student leader, Mr. Hadi had become an outspoken critic of the authoritarian rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose government collapsed in August 2024 after a monthslong standoff with a youth-led movement.\n\nAccording to the U.N.\u2019s fact-finding report, at least 1,400 protesters were killed last year by the security forces and members of Ms. Hasina\u2019s Awami League party.\n\nAfter Mr. Hadi\u2019s death, protesters poured into the streets of Dhaka late Thursday night, demanding justice. Arsonists targeted not only newspapers but also the homes of several politicians in different cities.\n\nMs. Hasina, who ruled Bangladesh with an iron grip for 15 years, [fled to New Delhi]( last August and has been sheltered by the Indian government ever since. An interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has been running Bangladesh while factions scramble for position. An election, which Ms. Hasina\u2019s Awami League is barred from running in, is to be held on Feb. 12.\n\nMr. Hadi intended to run for Parliament as an independent candidate. He founded a cultural institution after Ms. Hasina\u2019s downfall and led an innovative campaign of handing out leaflets at mosques after morning prayers. He appeared on talk shows criticizing both the Awami League and what he regarded to be India\u2019s malign influence on his country.\n\nHe had spoken about the risks that came with his politics. \u201cWe only want that if someone shoots us dead, they are caught and brought to justice,\u201d he [told an interviewer]( recently.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read a copy of the full article here,]( in case you cannot access the original page.\n\n-----\n\n##See also:\n\n* [Presses fall silent after mobs torch offices of Bangladesh's top newspapers]( (Reuters)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/19/world/asia/bangladesh-riots-student-killing.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Make Korea great again: The right-wing group wooing disenchanted youth", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y27ekr26xo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spread of famine in Gaza Strip averted but Palestinians there still face starvation, experts say", "summary": "The spread of [famine]( has been averted in the Gaza Strip, but the situation remains critical with the entire [Palestinian territory]( still facing starvation, the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises said Friday.\n\nThe new report by The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes months after the group said famine was occurring in Gaza City and likely to spread across the territory without a [ceasefire and an end to humanitarian aid restrictions](\n\nThere were \u201cnotable improvements\u201d in food security and nutrition following an October ceasefire in the [Israel-Hamas war]( and no famine has been detected, the report said.

They are followed by two left-wing groups, The Left (Lewica) and Together (Razem), on 5% and 3.3% respectively, then the centre-right Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL) and centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050), each on 1.7%.\n\nHowever, when looking at the average results of recent polls, KPP is fourth on around 7%, well below Confederation, which is on around 13%, but marginally above The Left.\n\nAt the start of 2025, when he announced a surprise presidential run, Braun\u2019s polling numbers stood below 1%. However, after a campaign characterised by anti-Jewish, anti-Ukrainian and anti-LGBT rhetoric, Braun\u00a0[finished fourth](\u00a0in the presidential election, with 6.3% of the vote.\n\nHis KPP party, which blends Catholic ultraconservatism, economic libertarianism, monarchism and anti-EU sentiment, has now built on that success.\n\nBraun, who is a member of the European Parliament, and KPP were until this year part of the broader Confederation, which was formed in 2018 by a collection of far-right movements in order to stand jointly in elections.\n\nHowever, Braun and his party were ejected from the alliance in January this year after he announced his presidential candidacy despite Confederation having picked another of its leaders, S\u0142awomir Mentzen, as its official candidate.\n\nBraun has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories. Last month, he\u00a0[said](\u00a0that the Polish government is \u201cimplementing directives presented\u2026by various Jewish organisations\u201d. Earlier this year, he\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that the gas chambers at Auschwitz were \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nIn 2019, Braun claimed that \u201cJew-Masons\u201d are using \u201csodomites\u201d as part of their attempts to bring about \u201cworld revolution\u201d. He called for homosexuality to be criminalised and \u201csodomites sent to prison\u201d.\n\nLast week, Braun went on trial in Warsaw accused of crimes relating to four incidents, most infamously an\u00a0[attack](\u00a0on a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah in parliament in December 2023. He claimed in court that he is being prosecuted because he \u201cdared to defend myself against Jewish supremacy\u201d.\n\nBraun and his party have also campaigned against what they call the \u201cUkrainisation\u201d of Poland, suggesting that the large number of Ukrainian refugees and immigrants is a threat to Polish identity and sovereignty.\n\nHe has long been accused of having sympathies towards and links to Russia. In September, after Russian drones violated Polish airspace, Braun\u00a0[claimed](\u00a0that the incident was faked as part of a conspiracy, involving Poland\u2019s own government, to drag the country into the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn November, Braun and fellow KPP politicians wrote to Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov calling for a \u201cde-escalation\u00a0and\u00a0normalisation in\u00a0Polish-Russian\u00a0relations\u201d.\n\nBraun is separately subject to investigations by prosecutors for a number of other alleged crimes, many relating to various anti-Jewish, anti-LGBT and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric and actions carried out during his presidential campaign this year.\n\nLast month, the European Parliament\u00a0[stripped Braun of immunity](\u00a0to face charges for six alleged crimes, including inciting religious hatred against Jews, assaulting a doctor involved in carrying out a late-term abortion, and\u00a0[vandalising](\u00a0an LGBT+ exhibition.\n\nThere are also two further requests to lift Braun\u2019s immunity still pending.

It will be transferred to a museum.\n\nDuring a press conference in front of workers taking the table apart, Nawrocki declared that his decision marked the \u201cend of post-communism in Poland\u201d.\n\nThat refers to a term used by many on the Polish right to refer to the idea that Poland did not really regain its freedom in 1989, and instead continued to be ruled by a \u201cpost-communist elite\u201d made up of figures from the former regime and traitors from the democratic opposition.\n\nThe so-called Round Table Talks took place in Poland from February to April 1989 between representatives of the communist authorities and members of the democratic opposition, including the\u00a0[Solidarity trade union](\u00a0that had led opposition to the regime.\n\nThe talks led to partially free elections in June that year, which in turn helped pave the way for the downfall of the communist regime. Events in Poland also added momentum to the downfall of communism in other countries around the Soviet Bloc.\n\nThe Round Table Talks involved many figures who went on to hold prominent positions in post-communist Poland, including two presidents, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the leader of Solidarity, and Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, who had been on the communist side of the table.\n\nThe fact that some former communists continued to hold important positions in politics, business, the security services, the media and the judiciary has been used by some, in particular the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, to\u00a0[argue](\u00a0that the events of 1989 actually represented a betrayal.\n\nThey argue that the agreements reached at that time saw an elite made up of both former communists and some elements of the democratic opposition retain real power in Poland.\n\nSpeaking today, Nawrocki, who is aligned with PiS, echoed this sentiment. Celebrations that communism had ended in 1989 turned out to be \u201cpremature\u201d, said the president. \u201cBecause, as we know, communist elites and security service officers after 1989 \\[continued to\\] play an important role.\u201d\n\nHe accused some of the opposition figures who sat at the round table of having a form of \u201cStockholm syndrome in which all the crimes of the communist system were forgiven and those who murdered Poles were still supported in a symbolic and political sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday, a free, independent, sovereign and ambitious Poland can do much more than idealise the round table,\u201d continued the president. \u201cWe cannot infect future generations of Poles with the backwardness of the communist system.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, in the 21st century, young Poles \u2013 those born in the 1990s and 2000s, but also my generation \u2013 do not have to make deals with former dictators, communists or post-communists,\u201d added Nawrocki, who was born in 1983.\n\nThe removal of the round table means that \u201cI can proudly say that post-communism has today ended in Poland\u201d, declared Nawrocki. \u201cLong live a free Poland.\u201d\n\nThe president, an academic historian who previously led the state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), acknowledged that discussion of the significance of the Round Table Talks is still ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe Round Table Talks cannot be forgotten because they are and will remain an important part of the historical discussion,\u201d he declared. \u201cBut neither can they be romanticised by paying tribute to them at the presidential palace.\u201d\n\nInstead, the table will be moved to the recently opened Polish History Museum in Warsaw, where it will be part of the main exhibition, due to open in 2027.\n\nSpeaking later to news website Onet, the museum\u2019s spokesman, Micha\u0142 Przeperski, said that the idea of removing the round table from the presidential palace dated back to the time of Nawrocki\u2019s predecessor, Andrzej Duda, who was also aligned with PiS.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s decision was, however, mocked by a member of the government, which has regularly been in conflict with the president.\n\nInterior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski sarcastically suggested that perhaps having the round table in his palace had \u201cstung the eyes\u201d of Nawrocki because it is \u201ca symbol for the entire world of a peaceful, bloodless and exemplary transition from dictatorship to democracy\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s current ruling coalition is accused by PiS of being part of the \u201cpost-communist elites\u201d that have ruled Poland since 1989. However, the government argues that it was PiS, during its time in power from 2015 to 2023, that undermined Polish democracy.\n\n*This article has been updated to include comments from the Polish History Museum\u2019s spokesman.*", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/18/president-removes-round-table-at-which-end-of-communism-in-poland-was-negotiated-from-his-palace/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Saudi-backed forces gather on Yemen border as separatists face pressure to pull back", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/saudi-backed-forces-yemen-border-separatists-stc", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Belgian politicians and finance bosses targeted by Russian intelligence over seized assets", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/belgian-politicians-finance-bosses-targeted-russian-intelligence-seized-assets", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin\u2019s annual \u2018circus\u2019: 5 top takeaways", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-puttin-russia-kremlin-5-takeaways-from-qa-show/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
