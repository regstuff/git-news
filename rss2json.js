MSc Computational Linguistics \u2013 University of Stuttgart, Germany\n2. MS in Statistics \u2013 NC State, USA\n\nMy goals:\n\n* Become employable in a tough tech market, with real industry-ready skills\n* Settle and work in the EU long-term\n* Work in machine learning / NLP / AI, ideally not just theory\n\nI currently have a B.A. in Linguistics and prior coursework in statistics and coding. If I do school in the U.S., I would eventually try to move to E.U., whether under a work visa or to do a second Masters.\n\nMSc CompSci tuition would be\u00a0**\u20ac**6,000 total, MS Stat would be $15,000 total (though I have an rollover Bachelor's full-ride scholarship from the university that could potentially cover most of the costs).\n\nPosted earlier from another sub, but I gotta make an urgent decision so I'm kinda desperate for input/opinions from anyone.

I am working on trying to automate upload of notes I have in Obsidian to OpenWebUI to assist in sort of an \"assistance/summarizer\" for my notes.\n\nI've been able to successfully upload all of my notes, which have various titles, content, usefulness, which is certainly mixed from a usefulness perspective.\n\nI keep running into issues when using the entire Knowledge Base of notes as Knowledge on a Workspace Model.\n\nTo test:\n\n* I created a Knowledge Base of exactly 1 markdown file that had content about something specific\n* I created a Workspace Model that references that Knowledge Base\n* I can prompt it and it retrieves what I would (mostly) expect\n\nWhere I encounter the problem:\n\n* I have a knowledge base of \\~600-700 markdown files ranging in sizes from couple of bytes to a couple hundred K in size\n* My workspace model references that knowledge base\n* I can prompt it, but it doesn't seem to \"find\" the appropriate/related Docs to reference, and usually says it can't find anything about that topic (a specific acronym that is only in a few docs for example)\n* It usually shows a handful of referenced Knowledge Docs, but none are the \"right\" ones\n\nI'll be honest, I don't fully understand how/what is sent to what model when (embedding model vs Model referenced in Workspace). I'm running ollama and have a few models I've used, sticking around the 4/8B parameter. I'm not 100% of what context limits I have with my local stuff, so I suppose that could also be an issue.\n\nIs this a Chunk config issue possibly?\n\nAn embedding model/prompt issue? I've tried a few different RAG template prompts, but doesn't seem to greatly change my outcome.\n\nConfig/ranking issue?\n\nAttaching my current config if there's anything in there specifically in there that I have \"wrong\" or that could be tweaked.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nEdit:  \nIt should be worth mentioning I've gone through the following \"guides\" or helpers as well, which are useful, but not quite solving my problem I seem to be encountering:\n\n*  [ \n* [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1mdidze/need_some_guidance_on_obsidian_markdown_files_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gift Nifty plunges over 170 points after Trump announces 25% tariff on India", "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Indian goods if re-elected, citing concerns over unfair trade practices.
