Instead of specifying apps or keywords to match, you briefly write down your task, what you need for it and what usually distracts you. Then, tab and program titles are continously evaluated for how distracting they are in regard to this description - completely offline on your device, nobody is monitoring you. The extension is designed to be neurodiversity-friendly, particularly in regards to ADHD, autism and demand avoidance. If you get distracted, one of 3 interventions will be triggered automatically:\n\n* a chatbot to help you get back on track\n* all distracting tabs are automatically identified and you\u2019ll be offered to close or save them for later\n* Firefox only: nudging you by coloring the toolbar depending on your distraction level\n\nAdditionally, you can check out your score history in a dashboard. Here are some potential use cases for this approach:\n\n* you need to browse some distracting website for a task, but also procrastinate there\n* you find yourself overwhelmed with dozens of tabs open and want to sort out all the distracting ones with one click\n* you are stuck in a hole of executive dysfunction or inertia and need a push to get out of it\n* you\u2019ve been using nudging tools but got annoyed about staring at a green screen for 10 seconds when you just need to take a quick look somewhere\n* you\u2019ve tried other blocking tools but found yourself sabotaging them out of frustration about rules being incompatible with reality\n\nI\u2019m looking for volunteers to test this extension. If you complete the full study (12 days for Firefox / 9 days for other browsers), **you\u2019ll be eligible to participate in a raffle in which two winners will receive 20\u20ac each**. All you have to do is occasionally interacting with short self report prompts and the interventions. Every 3 days, the type of intervention that is triggered (of the ones listed above) changes, finished by a baseline period.

This initiative, stemming from a collaboration between Cambodia and India, aims to reestablish the tiger population in the Cardamom Mountains, an area where these apex predators were declared extinct in 2016. While this represents a conservation milestone, it also highlights the intertwined motivations of ecological preservation and economic gain.\n\nCambodia's tiger population, once [one of the highest in Asia]( was devastated by decades of war, poaching, and habitat loss. The last sighting was recorded by a camera trap in 2007, leading to the species being declared extinct in the wild in Cambodia by 2016. In contrast, India has seen significant success in tiger conservation, credited to [Project Tiger]( which began in 1973. This initiative has not only stabilised but also increased tiger numbers through stringent protection measures and community engagement.\n\nIndia's contribution to Cambodia extends beyond merely supplying the tigers. It involves a comprehensive transfer of conservation management expertise and ongoing support. This includes training Cambodian forest rangers and implementing state-of-the-art monitoring systems to ensure the tigers' protection. According to the report, this project will be managed by the Cambodian Ministry of Environment, the Indian Ministry of Forest and Climate Change, and the Wildlife Alliance. The true measure of success will be seen in how these practices are maintained and adapted to the local context over the long term, ensuring the tigers thrive in their new habitat.\n\n[Suwanna Gauntlett, founder and chief executive officer of Wildlife Alliance, presents details of her organisation\u2019s work in the Cardamoms, at a May 23 press conference held to announce the impending return of tigers to the mountain range. Hong Raksmey \\(Source: Phnom Penh Post\\)](\n\nDevyani Khobragade, Indian ambassador to Cambodia, emphasised the global significance of the tiger reintroduction programme.\u00a0\n\n&gt;\u201cThis programme is crucial for restoring biodiversity in not just Cambodia, but also for contributing to global biodiversity,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt is also a moral duty for all of us present here today,\u201d she added.\n\n&gt;\"By working together and adhering to global best practices, we can ensure the long-term conservation of endangered species and the preservation of ecosystems for future generations,\" said Khobragade.\n\n&gt;\"There will be long-term monitoring of the tiger population integrating into the Cardamom Mountains\u2019 sanctuary,\" Khobragade said, noting that the first four tigers are expected to arrive in Cambodia this November or December.\n\nWhile the ecological benefits of tiger reintroduction are clear, the economic motivations are equally significant. The Cambodian government views this project as a potential boon for the ecotourism industry, which could generate substantial revenue. However, there have been [concerns raised by conservationists]( in the past that the financial perspective might overshadow the primary goal of ecological conservation.  The challenge lies in balancing these interests, ensuring that the economic benefits contribute to, rather than detract from, the tigers' long-term survival and the health of the ecosystem.\n\nFor the reintroduction project to be successful, India must seek support of other partners who are deeply invested in environmental protection efforts through various initiatives in Cambodia such as USAID. By aligning with these initiatives, India can ensure that Cambodia enhances its conservation capabilities and tourism appeal, creating a model for conservation-driven economic development.\n\nIn my view, the presence of Indian ecology and wildlife researchers will be crucial in the initial years following the tigers' reintroduction. These experts from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (erroneously referred to as \"National Technical Conservation Authority\u201d in the Post article) and Wildlife Institute of India will need to work closely with local conservation teams to monitor the tigers' adaptation to their new environment and the ongoing ecological impact. Such a collaborative research effort should focus on adaptive management strategies that address emerging challenges and ensure the sustainability of the tiger population.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe return of the tiger to the Cardamom Mountains is a watershed moment,\u00a0a daring gamble with the potential to redefine Cambodia's conservation legacy and ignite its economy.\u00a0This ambitious project,\u00a0supported by the former Prime Minister and current Senate President Hun Sen,\u00a0is a gamble he's personally invested in.\u00a0The successful reintegration of this apex predator into Cambodia's delicate ecosystem could be a resounding triumph,\u00a0silencing past doubts and cementing a powerful narrative of environmental stewardship.\n\nMoreover,\u00a0the tiger isn't just an animal for Cambodians; it's a potent symbol deeply woven into their folklore,\u00a0a guardian spirit that resonates with the nation's collective psyche.\u00a0Installing the foundations for a thriving tiger population could be interpreted as a bold opening move in India's bid to forge a stronger alliance between the two countries.\u00a0Yet, the success of this endeavour hinges on continuous international collaboration, effective management practices, and a commitment to maintaining the delicate balance between ecological health and economic benefits. As Cambodia and India embark on this ambitious journey, the global conservation community remains watchful, hopeful that this initiative will serve as a beacon of successful biodiversity restoration.\n\nUPDATE: [PTI is reporting that a final decision on this has yet to be made.](\n\nFurther reading:\n\n* Phnom Penh Post: [Tigers set for return to Kingdom\u2019s forests in biodiversity coup]( (24 May 2024)\n* Phnom Penh Post: [Cambodia's Tiger Population Second-Highest in the World]( (13 April 1999)\n* LiveMint: [Should India be Sharing its Tigers with Cambodia?]( (15 April 2016)\n* Mongabay: [Is Cambodia\u2019s plan to reintroduce tigers doomed to fail?]( (1 November 2017)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1czk8cg/tigers_as_ambassadors_strengthening_indiacambodia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ancient Maya Beekeeping Site Discovered in Mexico", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.archaeology.org/news/12414-240523-maya-beekeeping-panuchos", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why isn't India proposing a joint South Asian/Indian Ocean weather centre?", "summary": "India should take the lead on proposing a BIMSTEC weather centre that has associate partners (Iran, Afghanistan, UAE, Australia, Reunion, Maldives, Mauritius, Somalia, Ethiopia) to set up a transnational weather and climate centre to pool resources and technology. The intended outcome of this would be to get more accurate predictions across South Asia and the broader Indian Ocean ring region as the waters in the area continue to warm out of control, and the air over Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean disproportionately warms as a result.   \n    \nHaving a unified weather and climate service, I think, will add to a lot of accurate and nuanced medium and long term predictions for agriculture and fisheries in the area. The existing federated system serves it's purpose for immediate use, but for 3-8 month outlooks in something as cascading as weather, we should take the initiative and pool resources to create a novel solution for the region.  \n   \nThis can help substantially in soft power projection as well.
