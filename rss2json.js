I recently started my first job and don\u2019t have much free time to read my favorite books, so I purchased Speechify to listen while I chores.\n\nThe issue I\u2019m facing is that I can\u2019t seem to get any reading apps to work properly with Hindi PDFs. I\u2019ve tried Speechify, Natural Reader, and Microsoft Edge\u2019s read-aloud feature, but each platform produces garbled audio, regardless of the language setting. I attempted to copy the Hindi text into MS Word, but it still comes out as gibberish. I suspect this is why no platform can read it correctly.\n\nI tried using Hindi OCR it worked, but it only works on individual pages and using an OCR website for 100 or 200 times for a single PDF would take too long. I tried hindi ocr in pdf 24tools website but still the same gibberish.\n\nCan you help me figure this out, please?\n\n\\[example of text i get after copying it to ms word- \u0918\u0902\u091f\u093e\u0918\u0930 \u0915 \u092e\u0928\u0941\u00d6\u092f \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0939\u01ad \u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0925\u093e\u0964 \u0909\u0938\u0928\u0947\u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947\u092a\u0948\u0930\u01c2 \u0938\u0947\u0909\u092a\u091c\u093e\u090a \u092d\u0942\u0232\u092e \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0902\u00c9\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0915\u0947 \u0935\u0939 \u092a\u0917\u0921\u00c5\u0921\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u091f\u025f \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u0939\u093e\u0901\u092a\u0930 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u093e \u092a\u0193\u0901\u091a\u0928\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0193\u0906\u0964 \u01a0\u0938\u0930\u0947, \u0924\u0940\u0938\u0930\u0947\u0914\u0930 \u091a\u094c\u0925\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u00d7\u0924\u0935 \u092e\u01b6\u0909\u0938 \u092a\u0917\u0921\u00c5\u0921\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u091a\u094c\u095c\u093e \u0231\u0915\u092f\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0935\u0937\u01c4 \u0924\u0915 \u092f\u01c2 \u0939\u0940 \u0932\u0917\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0930 (\u0906\u0924)\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u0928\u0947\u0938\u0947\u0935\u0939 \u092a\u0917\u0921\u00c5\u0921\u0940 \u091a\u094c\u095c\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092e\u093e\u0917\u00b5\u092c\u0928 \u0917\u0908\u0964 \u0909\u0938 \u092a\u0930 \u092a\u00c6\u0925\u0930 \u092f\u093e\\]", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fkmhtv/cant_figure_how_to_use_hindi_pdfs_in_any_read/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Build a realtime AI Avatar for Coaching and training Simulations", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/CerebriumAI/examples/tree/master/28-sales-trainer", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Peltola bill would lift ban on bringing puppies through Canada", "summary": "", "link": "https://alaskapublic.org/2024/09/19/peltola-bill-would-lift-ban-on-bringing-puppies-through-canada/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli soldiers pushed three apparently lifeless bodies from roofs during a West Bank raid", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-soldiers-qabatiya-west-bank-ae65d70f7da5db4603ba1b7c77f2ccd3", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
