I have realized (by reading academic articles about the subject) that I really like NLP and I'd like to pursue a career in this field. I'm also learning how to program and I find this enjoyable too so far.\nAt the moment I need to choose what to do with my studies. The options I can think about are either to get in a master's degree for computational linguistics or to complete a second bachelor in computer science (where I live uni is pretty cheap so I can afford this).\nMy worries are that the mater in computational linguistics has a program that is far too theoretical (I've done some research and almost all students that graduate from this master get into PhD programs) and therefore wouldn't give me any actual technical and practical skills that will be useful to find a job. That's why I'm considering to start a bachelor in computer science instead.
