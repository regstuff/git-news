Check out the GitHub repo with the minimal reproducible example to test it yourself.\n\n  \nNow a longer version.\n\nSome background: I'm developing an STT-based language-learning app, Natulang, and I'm using multiple real-time STT engines - Siri, AWS Transcribe, Deepgram, and\u00a0[Fireworks.ai](\u00a0AST. I tried many more (VOSK, Google Assistant, Picovoice, AssemblyAI, and others), but they are either not good enough for production or aren't good for my use case.\n\nAt the beginning, Fireworks was the best among cloud engines (Siri is on-device, so it's hard to match its performance) - fast, precise (with a prompt), and reliable.\n\nBut starting from November 12, I started to receive complaints from my users about Fireworks not responding sporadically and not providing any transcriptions.\n\nAfter contacting support, they confirmed an unusual pattern of open vs. active connections that started abruptly on November 12. They assumed \"changes on my side\" as a cause.\n\nSince my app is mobile (gradual releases) and I didn't do any releases on the 12th, the pattern was a clear indication of an error on their side.\n\nOn November 20, I provided them with a minimal reproducible example that reproduced the error in isolation. They confirmed the issue after running my code only after 4 days (on the 24th) and after 3 daily emails that went unanswered.\n\nSince then, I've been writing to their support every few days. They haven't fixed the issue. They provided a workaround - checking whether the service is unresponsive and reconnecting - but, as you might guess, it's far from an acceptable solution for a real-time application.\n\nSo in short, they could be a great service: fast, cheap, and precise. But until they fix both their service, their processes, and their support, stay away.\n\nThe issue should've been detected and fixed in hours, or maybe in a day, with a rollback. But they didn't detect it themselves, didn't investigate it themselves (they confirmed that the issue is on their side only after having my code), and haven't fixed it for a month (and I'm still waiting).
