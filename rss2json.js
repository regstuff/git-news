What hidden assumptions am I making? What evidence might contradict this?\"\n\nThis has saved me from multiple bad decisions by revealing beliefs I had accepted without evidence.\n\n# The Devil's Advocate\n\nWhen you're in love with your own idea:\n\n    \"I'm planning to [your idea]. If you were trying to convince me this is a terrible idea, what would be your most compelling arguments?\"\n\nThis one hurt my feelings but saved me from launching a business that had a fatal flaw I was blind to.\n\n# The Ripple Effect Analyzer\n\nBefore making a big change:\n\n    \"I'm thinking about [potential decision]. Beyond the obvious first-order effects, what might be the unexpected second and third-order consequences?\"\n\nThis revealed long-term implications of a career move I hadn't considered.\n\n# The Blind Spot Illuminator\n\nWhen facing a persistent problem:\n\n    \"I keep experiencing [problem] despite [your solution attempts]. What factors might I be overlooking?\"\n\nUsed this with my team's productivity issues and discovered an organizational factor I was completely missing.\n\n# The Status Quo Challenger\n\nWhen \"that's how we've always done it\" isn't working:\n\n    \"We've always [current approach], but it's not working well. Why might this traditional approach be failing, and what radical alternatives exist?\"\n\nThis helped me redesign a process that had been frustrating everyone for years.\n\nThese are just 5 of the 13 prompts I've developed.

I have an interest in math, theoretical linguistics, and technology, and I feel doing something that exercises all of them would be really interesting for me personally. It is a field with a lot of applications in very different places, some requiring more math than linguistics, some requiring more linguistics than math, etc. What applications would be best if I wanted to work out my math and theoretical linguistics muscles?\n\nAnother question: I'm multilingual (Arabic and English natively, German at B2 and French at C1). In what ways could it be an asset when working with language technology?\n\nThanks\n\nMM27", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jmoeom/question_about_clnlp_applications/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gaza enters longest stretch without aid as Israel continues airstrikes", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna198696", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pikachu Becomes Viral Symbol of Resistance During Anti-Erdo\u011fan Protest In Turkey", "summary": "", "link": "https://animehunch.com/pikachu-becomes-viral-symbol-of-resistance-during-anti-erdogan-protest-in-turkey/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
