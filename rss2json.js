I have crps, i am currently on the way to remission. My condition is and will continue to get better, but we have no clue what the rest of my life will be like let alone a year from now. My current big goal is regaining the ability to walk and stand for 3 hours. Currently 30 minutes is the max i can do. So, my dream of being an archeologist is out of the question right now. But im thinking about the future.\n\nIf im right, i think I'll always need the wheelchair, but i also think one day I'll reach my 3 hour goal. Im currently trying to get an electric scooter attachment for my manual chair so i can go on hiking trails again, it makes your chair kind of like an off road scooter, goes for 15 miles each charge, its for getting people like me in the outdoors.\n\nNow this job, i don't think I'll ever realistically be able to dig for hours, walk for hours, intense physical labor ect. the disease is in my elbows, wrists, and knees. However, i can draw, i could maybe sift through buckets of dirt in my chair. I could one day maybe sit at a desk, do lab work, be on a computer. My dream is to be digging in the dirt, or be in the feild in any way. Maybe my scooter could get me there, maybe i could draw the site. I don't know. If i ever work again, which is a big if, it would have to be part time, I'd need to be able to stop as soon as my body tells me too, no matter what im doing. I'd need so many accommodations like flexible hours, maybe it would make more sense to volunteer? Maybe work at a museum? I don't know.\n\nWhat can i do in this job, realisticly, with these limitations? My disease is one of the most unpredictable ones out there, its progessive, I'll have it forever, but remission is possible and im one of the few lucky ones who's actually probably going to get that. If i heal enough to have the life i want, i want to do myself the justice of trying, living to the fullest, but my body's health comes first before everything. I've suffered too much to ever sacrifice my health again. This is all hypothetical, i may never even get this chance, but for the past 5 years my plan for the future was \"live to see the next day\" and now i don't have to fight tooth and nail anymore, so now im thinking about whats next, after this possible recovery happens.\n\nIf someone like me wanted to do even a fraction of what you do, is it possible? Realistic? Could it be part time? Please be honest even if it's not what i want to hear.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1i2ho26/im_physically_disabled_and_want_to_be_an/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Netanyahu says \u2018last minute crisis\u2019 with Hamas holding up approval of Gaza truce and hostage deal", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-01-16-2024-dc0ef64dd52db395c5a54328518e8efd?user_email=10b737622ff53ee407c7b76e81140855cc9e6e5c7fe21117a5b5bbf126443d96&amp;utm_medium=Morning_Wire&amp;utm_source=Sailthru_AP&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Wire_16%20Jan_2025&amp;utm_term=Morning%20Wire%20Subscribers", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The 'world's largest' vacuum to suck climate pollution out of the air just opened.

It can't give Bangaladesh anything. It hasn't even apologized for its crimes. But, still government in Dhaka is so keen on deepening ties with Islamabad. Why is it so? If Bangladesh want tech, investments, factories, manufacturing units, they have China, Russia, West Asia, South East Asia, US, The West, etc etc. There is literally 0 need for warm relationship with Pakistan. \nPeople say it's all about self interest of the nation, what's the interest in this?
