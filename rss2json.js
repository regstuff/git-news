I even got into an argument with a few people .\n\nThen I decided to actually look for myself what exactly he said . Fortunately the state government has the transcript .\n\nThe most popular one on social media is from :\n\nParticularly \n\n&gt;While a country may have borders, a true nation transcends such limitations. We have been unjustly divided, forced to exist under three different governments in three different countries, and this is something we can never accept.\n\nBut then above that paragraph you can see\n\n&gt;I am especially grateful to the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister, the Hon\u2019ble Home Minister and the Hon\u2019ble Finance Minister in this regard.\n\nWeird thing for a separatist to say huh. Maybe he's thanking modi for helping him create a Christian nation . So i decide to dig further .\nAnd it turns out there's another speech he made , on 2nd Sept 1 day before the above speech :\n\nThe contents are boring Christian stuff but the important parts are:\n\n&gt;I would like to mention that my presence here is with the permission of the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India.\n\n&gt;*The main objective of ZORO Movement in 1988 was Zo-Reunification within India.*\n\n&gt;Can the \u2018Zo\u2019 people in India, Burma and Bangladesh today, aspire to be re-united under *India*? Looking at the geo-political realities of our time, it may not be so farfetched to think this could be a possibility one day. Perhaps fate has this reunification in store for us in the future\n\nSo..it turns out the former IPS officer whom Indira Gandhi convinced to join mizo politics to combat the insurgent factions wasn't actually ..a separatist . Shocker \n\nApparently he also did a QnA ,which ironically enough i found out about from a well known bjp cellite trying to misinterpret him :\n\nThe idiot was stupid enough to not crop it so if you skip to 5:30 you'll actually see him debunk all the claims lmao\n\nNow I unironically feel stupid , my fault for not doing the basic fucking research\n\nedited : wrong dates", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1gm0mpx/on_the_issue_of_mizo_sedition/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Global Temperatures Likely To Exceed Key Limit For First Time", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/11/07/1838212/global-temperatures-likely-to-exceed-key-limit-for-first-time?utm_source=feedly1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Revealed: billionaires are \u2018ultimate beneficiaries\u2019 linked to \u20ac3bn of EU farming subsidies \u2022 Thousands of small farms have closed according to analysis of official but opaque data from EU member states", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/03/revealed-billionaires-ultimate-beneficiaries-linked-to-eu-farming-subsidies", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A theater mask made of 2000-year-old soil was found in Aizanoi, also known as \u2018Second Ephesus\u2019\n", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.anatolianarchaeology.net/a-theater-mask-made-of-2000-year-old-soil-was-found-in-aizanoi-also-known-as-second-ephesus/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "North Carolina man's age inspires $200,000-winning lottery purchase", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2024/11/07/lotto-North-Carolina-Education-Lottery-age/3751731010533/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Giant spiders that can grow to size of human hand thriving in the UK", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/05/giant-spiders-that-can-grow-to-size-of-human-hand-thriving-in-the-uk", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada orders TikTok to close offices over \u2018security risks\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/canada-orders-tiktok-to-close-vancouver-office-over-security-risks", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cro-Magnon gender-role evidence", "summary": "I\u2019ve recently read the book, \u201cCro-Magnon: How the ice age gave birth to the first modern humans,\u201d (2010) written by Brian Fagan, and I found it fascinating as an introduction. One thing though, was that the author was pretty good about describing the archaeological evidence for the conclusions he was drawing, except notably he never cited anything to substantiate his claim the men did the hunting and women sewed clothing from furs and skins. He repeated this assertion multiple times in the book without explaining the evidence.\n\nI know that within the past 5 years (well after the book I read was published) evidence has been found that indicates women often participated in hunting. It makes me wonder what, prior to that discovery, made archaeologists conclude that men generally hunted while women gathered/sewed clothing or otherwise took on a mostly domestic role. Was there evidence and if so what was it?\n\nI want to know if the assumption comes simply because women get pregnant and breastfeed, or if there were ever discoveries that can support that theory.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1gm6oyq/cromagnon_genderrole_evidence/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
