I do not want this post to be like a promotional post or something but we have been using an internal tool for some time and after seeing different people talk about this I thought lets just make it public. Please first read the other post and then read below i will also attach some articles talking about this and where to use the free tool.\n\nLong story short i kept running into this problem like everybody else. AI-generated articles, even when edited or value packed, were getting flagged and deindexed on Google, Reddit, everywhere. Even the domains on the search console where the affected domain was also took the hit (Saw multiple occasions of this)\n\nEven on Reddit, a few posts got removed instantly. I deleted the punctuations dots and commas, rewrote them fully myself, no AI copy and paste and they passed.\n\nTurns out AI text often has invisible characters and fake punctuation that bots catch or uses different Unicodes for punctuations that look like your \u201cnormal\u201d ones like u/Slurpew_ mentioned in his post. Like Ai ''Watermarks'' or \u201cFingerprints\u201d or whatever you wanna call it. The tool is [zerotraceai.com]( and its free for everyone to use, hopefully it saves you as much time as it did for us, by us i mean me and 2 people on my team that publish lots of content with AI.\n\nOfc it doesn\u2019t guarantee complete bypass of AI detection. But by removing obvious technical signals, it adds a powerful extra layer of protection. This can make the difference between being flagged or passing as natural content.\n\nIts like the v2 of humanizers. Instead of just rewriting words to make them sound more human, it actually cleans hidden junk that detectors or machines see but people don't.\n\nHere are some articles about this topic:\n\n[Rumidoc]( \\- \\[The verge\\] -", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kgze5w/chatgpt_is_extremely_detectable_solution/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "If you prompt ChatGPT just to write a LinkedIn post, content will be generic.

I quickly found many prompt management systems but none of them solved this problem for me. The closest I got to was LangSmith\u2019s playground which allows you to play around with prompts, see the different results, and chat with a bot that can provide recommendations. I started coding myself a little solution but then came upon this wonderful community of bright minds and inspiring cooperation and decided to try my luck. \n\nMy original idea was an agent that receives an original prompt template, an expected response, and notes from the user. The agent generates the prompt and checks how strong the semantic similarity between the result and the expected result are. If they are very similar, the agent will ask for human feedback and should the human approve of the result, return the prompt. If not, the agent will attempt to improve the prompt and generate the response, and repeat this process.\nDepending on the complexity, the user can delegate the similarity judgements on the LLM without their feedback. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDo you know of any projects that have already solved this problem?\n\nHave you dealt with similar problems?
