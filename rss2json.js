Throughout my career I've most enjoyed mentoring people and helping to place them in jobs that are good fits, wherever those may be. I've seen some common themes in career questions posted here and in related subs. My two cents below. Hope this helps. \n\n- Resume/CV and cover letter: spend 10 minutes to tailor to the firm you're targeting. Double check. I can't tell you how many times I've received a letter addressed to a competitor. \n\n- Interview: be genuine. Admit if you're unfamiliar with an app, piece of tech, artifact type, etc. I look for people who can ask smart questions and learn, not people who know everything. Don't be afraid to think out loud. That's actually the point of questions such as, \"tell me about a time when a project didn't go as planned and how you handled it.\" In my opinion those are the most illuminating interview conversations of all. \n\n- Dress: dependent on region and level. The general advice to dress for the next level up is sound. Business casual is usually fine for mid and senior. For field/ entry level, I'm fine with clean field wear. Just not pajamas or shorts and a dirty t-shirt. Those are real examples. \n\n- Be realistic about expectations. The absolute height of the US CRM market was probably 2020-2024. Salaries and perks seem to have softened a little since then. If you are applying for a field-heavy job (like 75% travel), don't insist you'll only be available for 25% travel. That doesn't fit with the interviewer's needs. (Note: I'm talking about a position-specific interview above. I've always been willing to have a more informal, open introductory chat with a potential future candidate, and have crafted positions to match such constraints after realizing, \"wow, we need this person onboard somehow.\")\n\n- References: for me, very important. I usually ask things like, \"Does X take criticism well? How does X work with a team?\" I take it all with a grain of salt (keeping in mind possible sexist/racist/etc assumptions on the part of the supervisor), but a great reference showing potential for learning and growth can make the difference for someone with minimal experience. \n\n- Technical experience and capabilities: specific to region, contract type, etc; others in this sub have addressed better than I could. \n\n- Passion: do you need it? I don't know. I'm not particularly passionate--like OMG THIS IS MY PURPOSE--about any of the work I've done. Maybe that coldness makes me good at the business side. I have seen passion put people into Magnum Opus mode and prevent them from doing efficient, profitable work. Then again, it's what you do with it. I guess I enjoy CRM because I can find something interesting in any type of resource, and I enjoy solving problems. Maybe that's passion after all. \n\n- Mindset: don't marinate in negativity and toxicity. It's so easy to shift from commiserating to spiraling. Think about the stories you tell yourself and others; I recommend Hidden Brain for this:  Also, try to cultivate a sense of self-efficacy, which is different (and I think healthier and more realistic) than chasing self-esteem, especially when you've had some negative experiences. I recommend Jen Kirkman's podcast for this ( and also for general info about neurodivergence such as autism and ADHD, which are extra-common in archaeology and can have real benefits (hyperfocus, etc). Someone very close to me speculated that my colleagues and I like people of the past because there's a safe distance from them, while living people make us uncomfortable. That feels very true. Uncomfortably so!\n\n- There are lots of career tips on the CRM Archaeology Podcast ( Classes, field schools, writing, resumes, job searches, best practices, etc. I've been recommending this podcast for years to prospective CRM archies and those who want to rise in the industry. But that brings me to caveats...\n\nCAVEATS\n\n- My own university, field school, and formal interview experiences as a candidate were many years ago. Maybe I'm fooling myself by thinking that those experiences can help navigate the current job market.  The hosts of the CRM Arch podcast episode referenced above make that point multiple times, but then one of the hosts still seems to make that mistake when dispensing advice. I could believe I'm doing that as well. \n- I am a cis/het white dude and present obviously as such. I know there is much more danger in someone who is female, another ethnicity, etc. in, say, taking my advice above and admitting they don't know something. Or in appearing too aggressive/confident. I try to be aware of these factors in my own decisions but have grown up in a biased culture. I'm sure there's more of that baked into me than I recognize.\n- Most of my own experience as an employee and an employer has been in small, privately-held companies with little or no formal HR gatekeeping.\n- I'm in the southern US.\n\nI hope this is helpful. I welcome your thoughts.
