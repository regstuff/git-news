Many Indians face prejudice in hiring, promotions, and daily workplace interactions, with stereotypes about their abilities and work ethic often holding them back.\n  \n2.  In the West, incidents of violence against Indians have been on the rise. Indians are often blamed for economic hardships or targeted due to their ethnicity, leading to physical assaults and harassment.\n\n3. Indians are frequently portrayed through harmful stereotypes in the media, from being cast as \u201cforeigners\u201d in their own countries to being depicted as subservient or overly academic. This reinforces negative perceptions and biases.\n\n4. Indian students abroad often face racial discrimination, from bullying in schools to exclusion from social activities, simply because of their background.\n\nThe only solution which can be solved by the Geopolitics game which our democrats should openly call out on international stage because the hate which once was on internet is now going into real world and is turning into a violent moment against Indians. \n\nFew solutions which i think India needs to handle diplomatically \n\n1. Strengthen Global Alliances and Diplomatic Ties\n\n2. Increase India's Global Economic Influence\n\n3. Promote Indian Soft Power Through Culture and Education\n\nIndia needs promote its rich cultural heritage, music, films, and food through soft power channels like the Indian diaspora, cultural diplomacy, and media. Just the same thing the Chinese and many south Asian countries have done i.e to put pressure on the portrayals of their people. \n\n4. Publicize Discriminatory Incidents and Demand Accountability\n\nLast year an Indian girl was brutally killed and the officers laughed and stated that her life value was just 10,000$ and despite having proof our diplomats didn't utter a word for her justice. \n\nIndian embassy in foreign countries even misbehave with our own people so how can we expect them to fight against the racism collectively as Indians? \n\nBy ensuring countries hold offenders accountable, India can create a more hostile environment for racial discrimination in global forums.\n\n5. Counter Negative Media Portrayals\n\nIndia should work on creating stronger media narratives that highlight the positive contributions of Indians in various fields\u2014technology, business, medicine, and entertainment. The media is one of the most powerful tools in shaping public perception, and India should invest in countering negative portrayals of its people with narratives that promote diversity, equality, and contribution.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1j33ojm/racism_impact_on_indian_geopolitics/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US Politics &amp; Threats to Commercial Archaeology.
