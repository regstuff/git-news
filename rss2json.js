He thanked Poland\u2019s president, Karol Nawrocki, and the Polish Speed Skating Association (PZ\u0141S) for helping him obtain citizenship.\n\nThe PZ\u0141S also announced the news, saying that Nawrocki had personally signed Semirunniy\u2019s citizenship documents after the athlete had been vetted by the security services.

Russia wanted him to have a 24-month ban, while Poland proposed 12 months. The International Skating Union settled on 14 months.\n\nIn January this year, the 22-year-old finally\u00a0[made his debut for Poland](\u00a0at the European Speed Skating Championships, where he finished tenth in both the 500 metres and 5,000 metres men\u2019s allround races.\n\nAt the World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships in March, he then won a silver medal for Poland in the 10,000 metres and bronze in the 5,000 metres.\n\n\n\nHowever, in order to compete at the Olympics for his new country, Semirunniy required Polish citizenship, which he has now obtained.\n\nThere are various pathways to obtaining Polish citizenship, including through residence or descent.

The documents I've received are all in PDF format, and many of them include **very long tables** \u2014 some spanning **10 to 30 pages** continuously.\n\nI'm using these PDFs to build a RAG system, so chunking the content correctly is really important for embedding and search quality. However, standard PDF chunking methods (like by page or fixed-length text) break the tables in awkward places, making it hard for the model to understand the full context of a row or a column.\n\nHave any of you dealt with this kind of situation before? How do you handle large, multi-page tables when chunking PDFs for knowledge bases? Any tools, libraries, or strategies you'd recommend?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1n1ib33/chunking_long_tables_in_pdfs_for_chatbot/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open WebUI + ComfyUI really slow", "summary": "Anyone know why comfyui is much slower with open webui? img gen from comfyui by itself takes about 45 seconds but when using with open webui it takes over 5 minutes.
