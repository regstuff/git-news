Exploring Cultural Bias in AI Reasoning [Thesis discussion/feedback welcome]", "summary": "Hey all \u2014 I\u2019m currently doing a Master\u2019s in Computer Science (background in psychology), and I\u2019m working on a thesis project that looks at how large language models might reflect culturally specific ways of thinking, especially when it comes to moral or logical reasoning.\n\nHere\u2019s the core idea:\n\n&gt; Most LLMs (like GPT-3 or Mistral) are trained on Western, English-language data. So when we ask them questions involving ethics, logic, or social reasoning, do they reflect a Western worldview by default? And how do they respond to culturally grounded prompts from non-Western perspectives?\n\n\n\nMy plan is to:\n\nUse moral and cognitive reasoning tasks from cross-cultural psychology (e.g., individualism vs. collectivism dilemmas)\n\nPrompt different models (local and API-based)\n\nAnalyze the responses to see if there are cultural biases in how the AI \"thinks\"\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I\u2019d love to hear from you:\n\nDo you think this is a meaningful direction to explore?\n\nAre there better ways to test for cultural reasoning differences?\n\nAny existing datasets, papers, or models that might help?\n\nIs analyzing LLM outputs on its own valid, or should I bring in human evaluation?\n\nHave you personally noticed cultural slants when using LLMs like ChatGPT?\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts \ud83d\ude4f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1kxyaah/do_language_models_think_like_the_west_exploring/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Exclusive: China hasn\u2019t shared river data with India since 2022, RTI query reveals", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/china-has-not-shared-river-data-with-india-since-2022-rti-query-reveals-exclusive-2731993-2025-05-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India's unilateral halt to water treaty: 4 options Pakistan can take - Nikkei Asia", "summary": "", "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/India-Pakistan-crisis/India-s-unilateral-halt-to-water-treaty-4-options-Pakistan-can-take", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Suggestions to Improve My Ollama + Open WebUI Deployment on Coolify", "summary": "Hi everyone,\nI recently set up a private server on DigitalOcean using Coolify (Platform as a Service). On this server, I installed Ollama along with Open WebUI, added a local model, and integrated a DeepSeek API.\n\nAdditional context:\nOne of my current ideas is to perform supervised fine-tuning on a model from Hugging Face and then integrate it with the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality in Open WebUI. Once the model is ready, I plan to integrate it into my application, specifically in the \u201cKnowledge\u201d section, and either fine-tune it further or give it a system prompt.\n\nMy question:\nWhat would be the recommended steps or best practices for achieving this? Any tips on how to optimize this process, ensure security, or enhance the integration?\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1kxzeq9/suggestions_to_improve_my_ollama_open_webui/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Chased, beaten and robbed: survivors describe Israeli settler violence in West Bank", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/28/chased-beaten-and-robbed-survivors-describe-israeli-settler-violence-in-west-bank", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India's alarm over Chinese spying rocks the surveillance industry | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/china/indias-alarm-over-chinese-spying-rocks-surveillance-industry-2025-05-28/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "We just hit 10M monthly downloads on Hugging Face!", "summary": "And it's all thanks to you guys - the amazing community, brilliant model labs, and incredible HF team! \ud83d\udc96\n\nThank you once again to each and every one of you guys who have supported us throughout the years and we can't wait for more!\n\nLet us know what models we should upload and new formats like AWQ, int4 etc. I'd love to know your thoughts! :)", "link": "https://i.redd.it/7wkbxa116j3f1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How I\u2019m Prompting ChatGPT\u2019s New Image Model to Create Insane Product Ads (and How You Can Too)", "summary": "If you\u2019re using OpenAI\u2019s new image model to generate product shots, marketing visuals, or ads\u2014and you\u2019re just writing \u201ca can on a table in nice lighting\u201d\u2026 you\u2019re leaving **a lot** on the table.\n\nHere\u2019s how to go way deeper.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 First, understand how the model *actually* works\n\nUnlike text generation, ChatGPT\u2019s new image model works off a **diffusion system** behind the scenes\u2014it literally denoises static until it looks like something. This means it's incredibly sensitive to *initial prompt structure*, *noun density*, and even *visual symmetry* of described objects.\n\nSo instead of just \u201ca red water bottle on a table,\u201d try this:\n\n&gt; \"A matte red insulated water bottle, centered on a white marble countertop, soft daylight from the left, shallow depth of field, natural shadows, crisp branding visible, high-gloss reflection beneath.\"\n\nThat small change? Night and day difference.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Prompt Structuring Framework\n\nBreak your prompts into this format:\n\n**[Object] + [Material &amp; Detail] + [Setting &amp; Context] + [Lighting] + [Camera/Angle/Focus] + [Post-processing/Vibe]**\n\n#### Example:\n&gt; \u201cA pastel pink ceramic mug with a smooth matte finish, resting on a linen napkin in a sunlit breakfast nook, overhead natural lighting with soft shadows, captured in a 50mm DSLR-style shot, with slight film grain and warm tones.\u201d\n\nYou're not just describing a product\u2014you\u2019re **directing a commercial shoot.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Words That *Actually* Matter (and why)\n\n- \u201cMatte\u201d / \u201cGlossy\u201d \u2013 triggers different reflections\n- \u201cShallow depth of field\u201d \u2013 gives you that creamy background blur\n- \u201cSoft lighting from left/right\u201d \u2013 helps the model understand light source\n- \u201c50mm DSLR shot\u201d \u2013 mimics real-world camera logic, better realism\n- \u201cSymmetrical composition\u201d \u2013 if you want balance in product layout\n- \u201cProduct branding visible\u201d \u2013 boosts logo clarity\n- \u201cStudio lighting\u201d vs \u201cnatural daylight\u201d \u2013 two entirely different moods\n\nMost people forget: this model **knows how cameras work**. It understands the language of film, lenses, lighting, and art direction\u2014so use that to your advantage.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 BONUS: Product Placement Magic\n\nWant to fake lifestyle scenes? Wrap your product in a believable context:\n\n&gt; \u201cA bottle of organic shampoo on a wooden bath tray beside a rolled white towel and eucalyptus leaves, in a spa-like bathroom with fogged glass background, captured with backlighting and steam in frame.\u201d\n\nLayering adjacent objects (towels, books, trays, hands, etc.) adds realism. The model fills in context better when you anchor it to a believable environment.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde8 Power Prompt Tips You Haven\u2019t Heard\n\n- **Use brand-adjacent objects** \u2013 e.g. sunglasses near a beach towel for summer ads\n- **Add time of day** \u2013 \u201cgolden hour,\u201d \u201cearly morning sun\u201d changes entire tone\n- **Describe mood through camera gear** \u2013 \u201cshot on vintage film,\u201d \u201cwide angle lens,\u201d \u201coverhead drone view\u201d\n- **Balance realism + abstraction** \u2013 if you go *too* detailed, it\u2019ll hallucinate. Use 5\u201310 descriptive chunks max\n- **Avoid vague adjectives** like \u201cnice,\u201d \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201camazing\u201d\u2014the model doesn\u2019t know what those mean visually\n\n---\n\n### \u26a1 TL;DR Prompt Blueprint\n\n1. Say what the object is, in exact detail  \n2. Describe the **materials**, **surface**, and **brand layout**  \n3. Put it in a real-world **context or setting**  \n4. Control the **lighting** and **composition** like a photographer  \n5. Add realism through adjacent objects or mood  \n6. Keep it **under 80 words** for best focus  ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kxu7ei/how_im_prompting_chatgpts_new_image_model_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Former Israeli PM Ehud Olmert says his country is committing war crimes", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/27/former-israeli-pm-ehud-olmert-says-his-country-is-committing-war-crimes", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In the 16th century, the \"Scavenger\u2019s Daughter\" was a brutal torture device.
