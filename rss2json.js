The British, who received their fair share of French language influence after 200 years of Norman rule, embraced and reshaped the word. By the 1700s, it meant something a bit different. Beyond its roots, \"cheers\" symbolized joy. \n\nRaising a glass and saying this word became an earnest expression, conveying happiness across time and cultures. The term \"cheer\" comes from Anglo-French, ultimately traced back to Medieval Latin cara and possibly Greek kara. All three words signify \"face,\" and early English \"cheer\" (often as \"chere\") reflected this meaning in medieval texts. By the late 1300s, \"cheers\" shifted its association towards happiness rather than sadness, seen in phrases like \"faces full of cheer\" or \"spreading holiday cheer.\" \n\nOver time, it encompassed joyful hospitality, entertainment, and food and drink at festive gatherings. The saying \"The more the merrier, the fewer the better cheer\" emerged from this concept. In the 16th century, \"cheer\" came to denote anything that brings joy, like \"words of cheer\" or \"a cup full of cheer.\" The verb form emerged in the 14th century, meaning to uplift from sadness, evolved into \"make glad,\" and eventually \"encourage into action.\" Sailors adopted it for ship salutations by the 17th century.", "link": "https://letempsdunebiere.ca/why-do-we-say-cheers-and-clink-our-glass/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "After all the praises for Milei have died down.
