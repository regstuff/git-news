Not trying to argue about it, just asking; being very open to answers.\n\nThe response, in short, was horrible. People asking for mods to remove the question, people assuming that OP is trying to push his religious beliefs because he just mentioned that giants are mentioned in the Bible (they are and over a billion people consider the Bible sacred scripture,) people saying ironically uneducated things about the Bible (the Bible isn't \"allegorical\" nor a \"50+ year long game of telephone\", it's an ancient library comprising many different genres ranging the historical, mythological, poetic, polemic, &amp;c.), and just general annoyance expressed without a helpful answer.\n\nI would reckon that most of the people kvetching about it are not archaeologists. If you are an archaeologist you inevitably get asked these sorts of questions in earnest and you know how to deal with them. When someone asks you in good faith if aliens built the pyramids, or if the Olmecs were from Africa, or if you dig dinosaur bones, those are all good opportunities to teach lay people about archaeology and what we actually do.\n\nIn short, assume good faith. OP seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but if he was more reactive, this could have very well just pushed him over the deep end.
