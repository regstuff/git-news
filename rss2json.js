I would like to know your thoughts on these points:\n\n1. Will I be able to get a good job after graduation in UK? I know that Edinburgh is one of the best universities in UK for NLP but UK is under a recession and jobs are very very scarce. I have been hearing this from a lot of other people as well. (I am an international student btw)\n\n2. I am also interested in pursuing research, but with only the program being 1 year, I need to work for another year atleast since application deadlines for PhDs will be very early into my program (2 months) and I won't have much to show + won't have reccos from profs at Edinburgh. \n\n3. I am enthusiastic about working on applications of NLP but I am scared choosing a degree in this sub topic might decrease the number of opportunities I have access to. For example, an MSc ML/AI degree might have more opportunities at just a Lang Tech degree. I have a general interest towards the ML/AI domain of Computer Science.\n\n4. I might have an option of working as an RA for a NLP lab at a premier research institute in my country. Should I wait a year and apply to more prestigious universities like CMU and UWash? They both have very good Lang Tech programs and obviously offer may more opportunities.\n\nMy background: 9.2 CGPA from a local university, multiple internships (AI/ML), 2 published papers (Q2 journal and Unranked conference), currently working as a RA in a very good research university, again in AI domain.\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you guys can give me some advice on these points.
