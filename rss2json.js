Despite Prime Minister Modi's efforts to project India's global status and his anticipated third term, the \"State of Southeast Asia 2024\" survey reveals India's decreasing strategic relevance in the region. India ranks the lowest in terms of economic, political, and security influence among nine major powers, with no significant improvement since the survey's inception in 2019. Lin notes India's inconsistent engagement with ASEAN nations, where historical ties with Myanmar and Singapore contrast sharply with India's lackluster economic relations with Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Furthermore, India's refusal to condemn Russia and its withdrawal from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership exemplify its inward-focused priorities, contributing to a perception of diminished capacity and willingness to lead on global matters.\n\nMy view: India's neglect of Cambodia and Laos highlights a strategic miscalculation in its regional policy. India's deliberate de-emphasis of these countries has ceded significant geopolitical space to China, reflecting a lack of strategic vision and leadership. Cambodia, with its millennia-old ties to India, holds immense geopolitical significance. However, India's lack of presence and failure to facilitate trade or business have rendered it almost irrelevant in Cambodia. Similarly, Laos remains under China's dominant influence, as India has shown little intent to bolster economic or diplomatic ties. India's neglect of these Mekong nations, where trade remains at rock bottom, showcases its preoccupation with domestic and sub-continental issues at the expense of regional engagement. This negligence not only exposes India's strategic short-sightedness but also raises questions about Modi's ambitions of expanding India's influence in Southeast Asia.
