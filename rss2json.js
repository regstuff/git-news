The candidate of the ruling LIBRE party, Rixi Moncada, came in a distant third.\n\nAsfura ran on a broad pro-business platform saying private investment was necessary to move the country forward, while his political agenda focused on jobs, education and security. He has also signaled he may swap Honduras' allegiance to Taiwan, and away from Beijing.\n\nThe results were so close and the [ballot processing system so chaotic]( that around 15% of the tally sheets, comprising hundreds of thousands of ballots, had to be counted by hand to determine the winner.\n\nIn the weeks following the vote, LIBRE repeatedly called for protests against what they denounced as an \"electoral coup.\" The protests interrupted the manual count, blocking officials from accessing the building where tally sheets were being stored.\n\nThe results were approved by two electoral council members and one deputy, as disputes continued over the razor-thin vote. The third council member, Marlon Ochoa, was not present in the video declaring the winner.\n\nNasralla rejected the CNE's declaration, saying it had excluded ballots that should have been counted, but urged his supporters to remain calm and refrain from any acts of disruption or violence.\n\nThe head of the Honduran Congress also rejected the results.\n\nTrump also threatened to cut off U.S. financial support to Honduras if Asfura did not win and [pardoned former President]( Juan Orlando Hernandez, also of Asfura's National Party, who had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. on drug trafficking and weapons charges.\n\nAmid delays in the count, Trump weighed into the election again alleging fraud without providing evidence and saying there would be \"hell to pay\" if Honduras changed preliminary results that had put Asfura ahead.\n\nTrump's backing of Asfura, experts say, is part of his push to mold a conservative bloc across Latin America, stretching from Nayib Bukele in El Salvador to Javier Milei in Argentina.", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-backed-asfura-wins-honduras-presidency-after-weeks-delays-disputed-2025-12-24/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Cocaine, gold and meat\u2019: how Colombia\u2019s Amazon became big business for crime networks", "summary": "Armed groups have moved in to the space left by the Farc after the civil war, cutting down rainforest to control land and build thousands of kilometres of smuggling routes\n\nA network of illegal routes is expanding in southern [Colombia]( across the Amazon forest, which covers [42% of the country]( Since 2018, various armed groups have built more than [8,000km of roads]( there, spreading like arteries through the jungle.\n\nThe layout of this new network almost exclusively benefits organised criminals, who control the vast region and use the roads to export illicit goods, which also add to the environmental devastation.\n\n\u201cOutside [Colombia]( there is demand for cocaine, gold and meat; the Amazon supplies that demand.
