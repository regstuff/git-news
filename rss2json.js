Others criticise the pro-EU government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The channel\u2019s profile description also included an anti-EU slogan associated with Polish\u00a0[radical-right leader Grzegorz Braun]( who supports Polexit.\n\nOn Tuesday, deputy digital affairs minister Dariusz Standerski noted that, \u201cin recent days, TikTok has seen a surge of videos generated using AI, spreading disinformation regarding Poland\u2019s membership in the European Union. The scale of this practice may suggest that we are dealing with an organised campaign\u201d.\n\nGovernment spokesman Adam Sz\u0142aka, meanwhile, declared that \u201cthere is no doubt that this was Russian disinformation\u201d. He noted that some of the texts spoken in the video contained Russian syntax.\u00a0\n\nStanderski also shared a copy of a letter he had sent to Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, requesting that she initiate proceedings against TikTok under the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nIn the letter, he argued that the videos \u201cpose a threat to public order, information security, and the integrity of democratic processes in Poland and across the European Union\u201d.\n\n\u201cAvailable information suggests that TikTok has not implemented adequate mechanisms for moderating AI-generated content,\u201d added the minister, \u201cnor has it ensured effective transparency measures regarding the origin of such materials.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cundermines the objectives of the Digital Services Act concerning the prevention of disinformation and the protection of users\u201d.

Only on 13 December 2025 did it change its name to a Polish one and begin publishing the videos about Polexit.\n\nRecent opinion polls have indicated\u00a0[growing support for Polexit]( with two surveys this month showing that 25% of Poles now think that their country should leave the EU. However, a majority still favour remaining in the bloc.\n\nGrowing anti-EU sentiment has coincided with a\u00a0[rise in support for Braun]( who finished a surprise fourth in this year\u2019s presidential election, and his Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP) party.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/31/poland-calls-for-eu-action-against-ai-generated-tiktok-videos-calling-for-polexit/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fire at new year\u2019s party in Swiss ski resort kills several people", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/switzerland-ski-resort-fire-live-intl-hnk", "author": "None"}, {"title": "German bank heist: Thieves use drill to steal \u20ac30m from savings bank", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grzz60kp3o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany\u2019s centrist establishment has long scorned the far left, but it is increasingly reliant on leftists to outmaneuver the far right in crucial votes in Parliament.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/world/europe/germany-parliament-die-linke.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ex deputy foreign minister to stand trial in Poland over visa corruption scandal", "summary": "Four people, including a former deputy foreign minister from the previous Law and Justice (PiS) government, have been indicted over alleged corruption in the issuing of visas. Hundreds of immigrants from Asia may have benefited from the scheme, which caused a scandal when it came to light in 2023.\n\nThe quartet, who also include two other former foreign-ministry officials, are accused of abusing their power to help people obtain Polish visas, which also provide access to the European Schengen area.\n\nIf convicted, the defendants could face maximum prison sentences of eight or 10 years. One of them has pleaded guilty, while the three others, including the former deputy minister, say they are innocent.\n\nThe so-called visa scandal\u00a0[emerged](\u00a0publicly in September 2023, shortly before parliamentary elections in which the PiS government was seeking a third term. However, the party lost its parliamentary majority and was removed from power.\n\nThe affair also prompted the resignation of the deputy foreign minister with responsibility for overseeing the consular and visa systems, who is named by prosecutors only as Piotr W. under Polish privacy law.\n\nPiotr W. is among those indicted today, accused of abusing his powers and disclosing official information to an unauthorised person. Meanwhile, his former aide, Edgar K. is facing nine charges of influence peddling.\n\nProsecutors say that Edgar K. acted as an intermediary in visa-related matters for over 600 people, in particular citizens of India, Nepal, Thailand and the Philippines, in return for which he received financial benefits totalling several hundred thousand zloty.\n\nPiotr W. then \u201caccelerated visa procedures for foreigners whose details he received from Edgar K., influencing in individual cases the content of visa decisions issued at Polish consular offices\u201d, according to prosecutors. He did not receive financial benefits for those actions.\n\nThe two other individuals indicted today are the former director and deputy director of the foreign ministry\u2019s consular department, named as Marcin J. and Beata B.\n\nThey are also accused of abusing their powers, including by \u201cexerting unlawful pressure on activities in visa matters performed by consuls and undertaking unjustified interventions to accelerate visa procedures\u201d at the behest of Piotr W.\n\nEdgar K. has pleaded guilty and provided evidence that has helped inform the charges against the other three, who have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe crimes Edgar K. is accused of carry a maximum jail sentence of eight years, while the other three could face up to ten years.\n\nIn August this year, six other people were also indicted as part of the same investigation. All face charges of influence peddling by paying or promising to pay Edgar K. for help in arranging visas. All but one of them has pleaded guilty.\n\nWhen the visa scandal broke, Poland\u2019s then opposition\u00a0[argued](\u00a0that it showed how the PiS government, despite its tough anti-immigrant rhetoric, was allowing large numbers of unregulated migrants into the country.\n\nThose former opposition parties are now in power, and have overseen the investigations into the affair. Last year, two diplomats\u00a0[told](\u00a0a parliamentary investigatory commission that the foreign ministry had pressured Polish consulates to issue visas to Indian citizens.\n\nSubsequently, the commission\u00a0[called for charges](\u00a0to be brought against senior PiS officials, including former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and former justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro.\n\nHowever, Piotr W. remains the only member of the former PiS government to have so far been charged.

In many places social media is helping to inform a younger generation which increasingly demands to be heard.\n\nIn Cameroon the average age, according to the UN, is just over 18. Yet the country this year saw the consolidation in power of Paul Biya - the planet's most aged president.\n\nThe 92-year-old, who has held office for 43 years, was sworn in for an eighth term, which could see him rule until he is almost 100.\n\nThis followed a round of divisive elections in October, condemned by critics as neither free nor fair - a charge rejected by the authorities.\n\nThe protests in Cameroon and Tanzania did not lead to change. But for those considering direct action elsewhere, there were lessons in 2025 of how protest can produce results.\n\nIn September, the Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar was rocked by weeks of youth-led protests against poor service delivery, forcing the country's President Andry Rajoelina to sack his entire cabinet.\n\nBut it was not enough to save his leadership. The protests continued and in October Rajoelina was deposed in a coup.\n\nMany analysts believe demonstrations could be a growing feature of Africa's politics.\n\nPublic disillusionment is key. The sense of satisfaction is going down.
