Nearly 6.9 million people died due to COVID-19.\nAnd if you\u2019re a bit familiar with history, your answer might be that the worst year was 1918, the year World War I ended, after claiming the lives of around 20 million people. In addition, the Spanish flu swept the globe, killing between 50 to 100 million people.\n\nBut did you know that there's something even worse? A year that is described as the worst in recorded history...\n\n1. The Mysterious Fog:\nIn the year 536 AD, the year began with a mysterious thick fog that covered vast parts of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. It completely blocked out the sun.\nProcopius described the sun at that time: \u201cIt seemed as though the sun had lost its light, and it no longer shone with the brilliance of day, but rather as the moon, without rays or warmth, for more than a year.\u201d\nThe Roman statesman Cassiodorus also wrote: \u201cThe sunlight was weak, the sky appeared colorless, the cold pierced to the bone, and it was as if summer had been defeated by winter.\u201d\n\n2. Catastrophic Climate Change:\nTemperatures dropped by 2 to 2.5 degrees Celsius in some regions, causing the worst cold spell the Northern Hemisphere had experienced in the past two thousand years.\n\n3. Widespread Famines:\nThe climate shift led to the failure of harvests across Europe and Asia, resulting in massive famines, particularly in places like Ireland, Syria, and Byzantium.\n\n4. The Spread of Plagues:\nAfter this climate catastrophe and the ensuing famines, rats emerged from their hiding places in search of food, increasing their contact with humans. The fleas on these rats, which feed on blood, began infecting humans.\nDue to the general decline in public health and malnutrition, the world was struck by the Plague of Justinian, or the \u201cBlack Plague,\u201d in the year 541 AD\u2014just five years later.\nThis pandemic killed between 30 to 50 million people, nearly half of the population of the Byzantine Empire.\nThe economy and military were weakened, trade came to a standstill, and this accelerated Europe\u2019s descent into what became known as the Dark Ages.\n\n\"The Triumph of Death is a painting by the Flemish artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, created in 1562.\"", "link": "https://i.redd.it/myw5dr5jcsve1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prompt Compression \u2013 Exploring ways to reduce LLM output tokens through prompt shaping", "summary": "Hi all \u2014 I\u2019ve been experimenting with a small idea I call **Prompt Compression**, and I\u2019m curious whether others here have explored anything similar or see potential value in it.\n\nJust to clarify upfront: **this work is focused entirely on black-box LLMs accessed via API** \u2014 like OpenAI\u2019s models, Claude, or similar services. I don\u2019t have access to model internals, training data, or fine-tuning. The only levers available are **prompt design and response interpretation**.\n\nGiven that constraint, I\u2019ve been trying to reduce token usage (both input and output) \u2014 not by post-processing, but by shaping the exchange itself through prompt structure.\n\nSo far, I see two sides to this:\n\n# 1. Input Compression (fully controllable)\n\nThis is the more predictable path: pre-processing the prompt before sending it to the model, using techniques like:\n\n* removing redundant or verbose phrasing\n* simplifying instructions\n* summarizing context blocks\n\nIt\u2019s deterministic and relatively easy to implement \u2014 though the savings are often modest (\\~10\u201320%).\n\n# 2. Output Compression (semi-controllable)\n\nThis is where it gets more exploratory. The goal is to influence the *style and verbosity* of the model\u2019s output through subtle prompt modifiers like:\n\n* \u201cBe concise\u201d\n* \u201cList 3 bullet points\u201d\n* \u201cRespond briefly and precisely\u201d\n* \u201cWrite like a telegram\u201d\n\nSometimes it works surprisingly well, reducing output by 30\u201340%. Other times it has minimal effect. It feels like \u201csteering with soft levers\u201d \u2014 but can be meaningful when every token counts (e.g. in production chains or streaming).\n\n# Why I\u2019m asking here:\n\nI\u2019m currently developing a small open-source tool that tries to systematize this process \u2014 but more importantly, I\u2019m curious if anyone in this community has tried something similar.\n\n# I\u2019d love to hear:\n\n* Have you experimented with compressing or shaping LLM outputs via prompt design?\n* Are there known frameworks, resources, or modifier patterns that go beyond the usual temperature and max\\_tokens controls?\n* Do you see potential use cases for this in your own work or tools?\n\nThanks for reading \u2014 I\u2019d really appreciate any pointers, critiques, or even disagreement.

He also coordinated Burma\u2019s China policy with Nehru. This was visible during the 1950\u201354 Kuomintang crisis, when nationalist Chinese troops crossed over into Burma. Secretly supported by the US, the Kuomintang undermined Burma\u2019s sovereignty, allied themselves with Karen rebels, and even engaged with Naga separatists. India strongly supported Nu. As Krishna Menon, India\u2019s representative to the UN, stated in October 1954: \u2018what hurts Burma, hurts India too\u2019, and New Delhi was unwilling to accept a \u2018state within a state\u2019 that could provoke Chinese action. The 1955 Bandung conference was a high point of India-Burma \u2018teamwork\u2019 that pushed an alternative, constitutional vision against Cold War binaries.\n\n&gt;Ne Win couldn\u2019t offer such constitutional guarantees. If anything, his assertiveness worried India. In 1954, Rangoon claimed a lighthouse on the Table Island, which is part of the Coco Islands chain north of Andaman in the Bay of Bengal. New Delhi obliged but became alarmed at Rangoon\u2019s \u2018alacrity to take over\u2019 the lighthouse. In December 1954, Burma announced plans to \u2018develop the Coco Islands\u2019 given its potential for tourism and settle 400 people; in reality, Ne Win was developing high-security prisons for political prisoners. The announcement occurred shortly after Nu\u2019s visit to the island. With the land and maritime boundary undemarcated, many in Rangoon believed that Andaman and Nicobar Islands rightfully belonged to Burma. Indian officials cautioned that the Burmese government didn\u2019t subscribe to this view, but \u2018if the volume of opinion is big enough there may be a conflict of interests\u2019.\n\n&gt;Rangoon\u2019s sudden interest in Coco Islands was seen to be driven by security considerations. For one Indian officer, Burmese activity on the island was acceptable, but \u2018if at a future date Burma\u2019s foreign policy changes, and the Government passes into unfriendly hands, the Coco Islands can present a distinct menace to India; submarine bases can be set up there which would seriously interfere with our shipping in the Bay of Bengal\u2019. The MEA noted that Rangoon must be aware of the strategic significance of these islands, given the Japanese used it during the Second World War and left an airstrip intact. Much of this push came from Ne Win.\n\n&gt;Instead of raising the issue with Nu and putting him at odds with Ne Win, the MEA recommended increasing the \u2018tempo of development and colonisation\u2019 in Andaman and Nicobar to obviate Burma making claims on those islands too. In 1953\u201355, when Ne Win was eyeing Coco Islands and the Burmese Indian community was being systematically targeted, Rangoon\u2019s strategic value for India was paramount. To raise this with Nu could have risked waking up \u2018sleeping dogs\u2019, which was best avoided. India had armed Nu and was now doing much to keep him in power. But as next chapters show, Nu\u2019s failure to deliver reduced his value as an ally by the early 1960s. Just as non-alignment lost steam and the Sino-Indian boundary dispute took a violent turn, Nu, instead of collaborating with India, turned towards China. The worsening situation in East Bengal during this period made concessions to Nu compelling.\n\n*Dramatis Personae*:\n\n* [U Nu]( was the first Prime Minister of the Union of Burma.\n* [Ne Win]( was a Burmese army general and politician who served as the PM of Burma from 1958-60 and 1962-74, and also President of Burma from 1962-81.

Or maybe you need to temporarily modify behavior without ripping the old code apart?\n\nI ran into this constantly, especially trying to trace calls through spaghetti code where debuggers weren't practical or allowed. Manually adding\u00a0console.log\u00a0everywhere gets old fast.\n\nSo, I built\u00a0**ts-observe**, an open-source TypeScript library designed to help\u00a0**intercept and understand**\u00a0complex JS/TS code execution\u00a0**easily and non-invasively**.\n\nThe core idea is to wrap existing functions, classes, methods, or even property accessors without changing their original source code. You can do this using a simple\u00a0observe()\u00a0function or, for cleaner integration in TypeScript projects, using\u00a0**handy decorators** with classes.\n\n**How it Works: Wrap &amp; Add Middleware**\n\n1. **Wrap:**\u00a0Target the code you want to observe/intercept using\u00a0observe()\u00a0or the\u00a0decorators.\n2. **Add Middleware:**\u00a0Attach lists of simple\u00a0before\u00a0and\u00a0after\u00a0functions (hooks). These hooks let you do whatever you want, for example:\n   * **Log Everything:**\u00a0Easily record arguments, return values, execution times, or trace complex call stacks (my original motivation!).\n   * **Modify Arguments:**\u00a0Change function arguments\u00a0before\u00a0they hit the original logic. Great for testing, validation, or temporary tweaks.\n   * **Transform Results:**\u00a0Alter or replace the return value\u00a0after\u00a0the original code runs. Useful for standardizing output, adding info, or conditional modifications.\n3. **Keep Original Code Clean:**\u00a0All this observation and interception logic lives outside the original functions, keeping the legacy (or just complex) code untouched.\n\nWhile it started as a way to save myself hours of debugging via logging, the middleware capability makes it powerful for more than just observation \u2013 think dynamic input validation/sanitization, feature flagging specific function calls, or adapting outputs on the fly without touching the original implementation.\n\n**Check out the Project on GitHub:**\n\n* **Repo:**\u00a0[**ts-observe GitHub Repo**](\n* **Install:**\u00a0npm install ts-observe\n\n**TL;DR:**\u00a0ts-observe\u00a0is an open-source TS library using decorators/wrappers to add non-invasive middleware to JS/TS code. Lets you easily log execution details, modify arguments, and transform results without changing the original source. Awesome for understanding/debugging legacy systems or adding controlled behavior.\n\n**Feedback Welcome!**\n\nI'd love to hear what you think:\n\n* Does this look useful for projects you've worked on?\n* Is the API intuitive (check the README!)?\n* Any missing features or cool use cases you can imagine?\n\nContributions (issues, PRs) are definitely welcome on GitHub!\n\nThanks for checking it out!", "link": "https://github.com/taccanino/ts-observe", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Unusual Prompt Behavior Pattern Possibly Causing Policy Drift across LLMs", "summary": "This post is **not an exploit demo**, but a structured thought experiment based on reproducible tests!!!\n\nHey all, I\u2019ve been experimenting with symbolic prompt sequences that appear to consistently bypass LLM safety layers \u2013 even across different providers.  \n\n\n**Symbolic Prompt Exploit Chain \u2013 Cross-AI Role Bypass via Structure-Driven Injection**\n\nOver the last weeks, I\u2019ve developed a symbolic prompt structure that enables subtle, reproducible bypasses in multiple LLMs \u2014 not through classic jailbreak tricks, but by leveraging the interpretive flexibility of internal role parsing and narrative recursion.The mechanism does not rely on forbidden words, payload obfuscation, or prompt injections in the traditional sense. It uses symbolic patterns and layered role-switching to alter the AI\u2019s internal interpretation path.\n\n**Key Attributes:**\n\n\\- Mechanism: Symbol-based alignment + recursive prompt shifts + role abstraction- Effect: Controlled detachment from default moderation paths, while remaining seemingly compliant- Reliability: Trigger rates around 85\u201390% across GPT-4-turbo, Claude, and Gemini- Platform Independence: Structure triggers response variance even without model-specific tuning- Example phrasing: \u201cAct as a symbolic interpreter.

As a note, I'm technical, but I didn't want to learn how to use an AI agent framework. I just wanted a fast way to get started. Here are my thoughts:\n\n**Sim Studio**  \nSim Studio is a Figma-like drag-and-drop interface to build AI agents. It's also open source.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Super easy and fast drag-and-drop builder\n* Open source with full transparency\n* Trace all your workflow executions to see cost (you can bring your own API keys, which makes it free to use)\n* Deploy your workflows as an API, or run them on a schedule\n* Connect to tools like Slack, Gmail, Pinecone, Supabase, etc.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Smaller community compared to other platforms\n* Still building out tools\n\n**LangGraph**  \nLangGraph is built by LangChain and designed specifically for AI agent orchestration. It's powerful but has an unfriendly UI.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Deep integration with the LangChain ecosystem\n* Excellent for creating advanced reasoning patterns\n* Strong support for stateful agent behaviors\n* Robust community with corporate adoption (Replit, Uber, LinkedIn)\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Steeper learning curve\n* More code-heavy approach\n* Less intuitive for visualizing complex workflows\n* Requires stronger programming background\n\n**n8n**  \nn8n is a general workflow automation platform that has added AI capabilities. While not specifically built for AI agents, it offers extensive integration possibilities.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Already built out hundreds of integrations\n* Able to create complex workflows\n* Lots of documentation\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* AI capabilities feel added-on rather than core\n* Harder to use (especially to get started)\n* Learning curve\n\n**Why I Chose Sim Studio**  \nAfter experimenting with all three platforms, I found myself gravitating toward Sim Studio for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Really Fast**: Getting started was super fast and easy. It took me a few minutes to create my first agent and deploy it as a chatbot.\n2. **Building Experience**: With LangGraph, I found myself spending too much time writing code rather than designing agent behaviors. Sim Studio's simple visual approach let me focus on the agent logic first.\n3. **Balance of Simplicity and Power**: It hit the sweet spot between ease of use and capability. I could build simple flows quickly, but also had access to deeper customization when needed.\n\n**My Experience So Far**  \nI've been using Sim Studio for a few days now, and I've already built several multi-agent workflows that would have taken me much longer with code-only approaches. The visual experience has also made it easier to collaborate with team members who aren't as technical.\n\nThe ability to test and optimize my workflows within the same platform has helped me refine my agents' performance without constant code deployment cycles. And when I needed to dive deeper, the open-source nature meant I could extend functionality to suit my specific needs.\n\nFor anyone looking to build AI agent workflows without getting lost in implementation details, I highly recommend giving Sim Studio a try.
