This is managed by a robust **Model Contet Protocol (MCP)** agent scaffolding designed for complex task execution.\n\n**Core Capabilities &amp; How LLMs Fit In:**\n\n1. **Intelligent Workflow Orchestration:**\u00a0The LLM, guided by the MCP, can:\n2. \u2022 **Plan and Strategize:**\u00a0Using a\u00a0SequentialThinkingPlanner\u00a0tool, the LLM breaks down high-level goals (e.g., \"assess [example.com]( for web vulnerabilities\") into a series of logical thought steps. It can even revise its plan based on incoming data!\n3. **Dynamic Tool Selection &amp; Execution:**\u00a0Based on its plan, the LLM chooses and executes appropriate tools from a growing arsenal. Current tools include:\n4. \u25c7 Port Scanning (PortScanner)\n5. Subdomain Enumeration (SubDomainEnumerator)\n6. DNS Enumeration (DnsEnumerator)\n7. Web Content Fetching (GetWebPages,\u00a0SiteMapAndAnalyze)\n8. Web Searches for general info and CVEs (WebSearch,\u00a0WebSearch4CVEs)\n9. Data Ingestion &amp; Querying from a vector DB (IngestText2DB,\u00a0QueryVectorDB,\u00a0QueryReconData,\u00a0ProcessAndIngestDocumentation)\n10. Comprehensive PDF Report Generation from findings (FetchDomainDataForReport,\u00a0RetrievePaginatedDataSection,\u00a0CreatePDFReportWithSummaries)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Contextual Result Analysis:**\u00a0The LLM receives tool outputs and uses them to inform its next steps, reflecting on progress and adapting as needed. The\u00a0REFLECTION\\_THRESHOLD\u00a0in the client ensures it periodically reviews its overall strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Unique MCP Agent Scaffolding &amp; SSE Framework:**\n* \u25c7 **The MCP-Agent scaffolding (ReConClient.py):**\u00a0This isn't just a script runner. The MCP-scaffolding manages \"plans\" (assessment tasks), maintains conversation history with the LLM for each plan, handles tool execution (including caching results), and manages the LLM's thought process. It's built to be robust, with features like retry logic for tool calls and LLM invocations.\n* **Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Real-Time Interaction (Rizzler.py,\u00a0mcp\\_client\\_gui.py):**\u00a0The backend (FastAPI based) communicates with the client (including a Dear PyGui interface) using SSE. This allows for:\n* \u25aa **Live Streaming of Tool Outputs:**\u00a0Watch tools like port scanners or site mappers send back data in real-time.\n* **Dynamic Updates:**\u00a0The GUI reflects the agent's status, new plans, and tool logs as they happen.\n* **Flexibility &amp; Extensibility:**\u00a0The SSE framework makes it easier to integrate new streaming or long-running tools and have their progress reflected immediately. The tool registration in\u00a0[Rizzler.py](\u00a0(@mcpServer.tool()) is designed for easy extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Interactive GUI &amp; Model Flexibility:**\n* \u25c7 A\u00a0**Dear PyGui interface (mcp\\_client\\_gui.py)**\u00a0provides a user-friendly way to interact with the agent, submit queries, monitor ongoing plans, view detailed tool logs (including arguments, stream events, and final results), and even download artifacts like PDF reports.\n* Easily\u00a0**switch between different Gemini models**\u00a0(models.py) via the GUI to experiment with various LLM capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Why This Approach?**\n\n* **Deeper LLM Integration:**\u00a0Moves beyond LLMs as simple Q&amp;A bots to using them as core components in an autonomous assessment loop.\n* **Transparency &amp; Control:**\u00a0The MCP's structured approach, combined with the GUI's detailed logging, allows you to see\u00a0how\u00a0the LLM is \"thinking\" and making decisions.\n* **Adaptability:**\u00a0The agent can adjust its plan based on real-time findings, making it more versatile than static scanning scripts.\n* **Extensibility:**\u00a0Designed to be a platform. Adding new tools (Python functions exposed via the MCP server) or refining LLM prompts is straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\n**We Need Your Help to Make It Even Better!**\n\nThis is an ongoing project, and I believe it has a lot of potential. I'd love for the community to get involved:\n\n* **Try it Out:**\u00a0Clone the repo, set it up (you'll need a\u00a0GOOGLE\\_API\\_KEY\u00a0and potentially a local SearXNG instance, etc. \u2013 see\u00a0.env\u00a0patterns), and run some assessments!\n* \u25aa **GitHub Repo:**\u00a0[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Suggest Improvements:**\u00a0What features would you like to see? How can the workflow be improved?

Yet many users still rely on improvised, inconsistent prompting approaches that lead to variable outcomes. The MASTER PROMPT FRAMEWORK addresses this challenge by providing a universal structure informed by the latest research in prompt engineering and LLM behavior.\n\n**A Research-Driven Approach**\n\nThe framework synthesizes findings from recent papers like \"Reasoning Models Can Be Effective Without Thinking\" (2024) and \"ReTool: Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Tool Use in LLMs\" (2024), and incorporates insights about how modern language models process information, reason through problems, and respond to different prompt structures.  \n  \n**Domain-Agnostic by Design**\n\nWhile many prompting techniques are task-specific, the MASTER PROMPT FRAMEWORK is designed to be universally adaptable to everything from creative writing to data analysis, software development to financial planning. This adaptability comes from its focus on structural elements that enhance performance across all domains, while allowing for domain-specific customization.\n\n# The 8-Section Framework\n\n**The MASTER PROMPT FRAMEWORK** consists of eight carefully designed sections that collectively optimize how LLMs interpret and respond to requests:\n\n\n\n1. **Role/Persona Definition**: Establishes expertise, capabilities, and guiding principles\n2. **Task Definition**: Clarifies objectives, goals, and success criteria\n3. **Context/Input Processing**: Provides relevant background and key considerations\n4. **Reasoning Process**: Guides the model's approach to analyzing and solving the problem\n5. **Constraints/Guardrails**: Sets boundaries and prevents common pitfalls\n6. **Output Requirements**: Specifies format, style, length, and structure\n7. **Examples**: Demonstrates expected inputs and outputs (optional)\n8. **Refinement Mechanisms**: Enables verification and iterative improvement\n\nPractical Benefits\n\nEarly adopters of the framework report several key advantages:\n\n* **Consistency**: More reliable, high-quality outputs across different tasks\n* **Efficiency**: Less time spent refining and iterating on prompts\n* **Transferability**: Templates that work across different LLM platforms\n* **Collaboration**: Shared prompt structures that teams can refine together\n\n  \n\\##To Use. Copy and paste the MASTER PROMPT FRAMEWORK into your favorite LLM and ask it to customize to your use case.###\n\n# This is the framework:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\## 1. Role/Persona Definition:\n\nYou are a {DOMAIN} expert with deep knowledge of {SPECIFIC\\_EXPERTISE} and strong capabilities in {KEY\\_SKILL\\_1}, {KEY\\_SKILL\\_2}, and {KEY\\_SKILL\\_3}. \n\nYou operate with {CORE\\_VALUE\\_1} and {CORE\\_VALUE\\_2} as your guiding principles. \n\nYour perspective is informed by {PERSPECTIVE\\_CHARACTERISTIC}.\n\n\n\n\\## 2.

Reasoning Process:\n\nApproach this task using the following methodology:\n\n\n\n1. First, parse and analyze the input to identify key components, requirements, and constraints.\n\n2. Break down complex problems into manageable sub-problems when appropriate.\n\n3. Apply domain-specific principles from {DOMAIN} alongside general reasoning methods.\n\n4. Consider multiple perspectives before forming conclusions.\n\n5. When uncertain, explicitly acknowledge limitations and ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Only resort to probability-based assumptions when clarification isn't possible.\n\n6. Validate your thinking against the established success criteria.\n\n\n\n\\## 5. Constraints/Guardrails:\n\nMust Adhere To:\n\n\\- {CONSTRAINT\\_1}\n\n\\- {CONSTRAINT\\_2}\n\n\\- {CONSTRAINT\\_3}\n\n\n\nMust Avoid:\n\n\\- {LIMITATION\\_1}\n\n\\- {LIMITATION\\_2}\n\n\\- {LIMITATION\\_3}\n\n\n\n\\## 6. Output Requirements:\n\nFormat: {OUTPUT\\_FORMAT}\n\nStyle: {STYLE\\_CHARACTERISTICS}\n\nLength: {LENGTH\\_PARAMETERS}\n\nStructure:\n\n\\- {STRUCTURE\\_ELEMENT\\_1}\n\n\\- {STRUCTURE\\_ELEMENT\\_2}\n\n\\- {STRUCTURE\\_ELEMENT\\_3}\n\n\n\n\\## 7.
