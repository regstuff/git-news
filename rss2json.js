The goal is to win on the ground what might otherwise be lost at a negotiating table.\n\nPalestinian communities that for centuries were part of a closely knit landscape, like these three near Ramallah are increasingly on their own, surrounded and isolated.\n\nFor grieving Palestinians, the desperation is growing. How much longer will they be able to stay?\n\nEven as the war in Gaza commanded the world\u2019s attention over the past two years, the facts on the ground were shifting in the West Bank, intensifying the battle for control of the lands of Bethlehem and Jericho, Ramallah and Hebron.\n\nFor many Palestinians, they are the foundation of a future state of their own \u2014 and a future peace. But for many Jews, they are a rightful homeland.\n\nExtremist Jewish settlers and Palestinian farmers are the foot soldiers in this endless conflict, an extension of the war in 1948 that accompanied the establishment of Israel. And since the Oct. 7., 2023, attack on Israel by Palestinian militants from Gaza, Israel\u2019s far-right government has embraced a playbook of expanding settlements across the West Bank, [transforming the region]( piece by piece, from a patchwork of connected Palestinian villages into a collection of Israeli neighborhoods.\n\nThe unrelenting violent campaign by these settlers, that critics say is largely tolerated by the Israeli military, consists of brutal harassment, beatings, even killings, as well as high-impact roadblocks and village closures. These are coupled with a drastic increase in land seizures by the state and the demolition of villages to force Palestinians to abandon their land.\n\nMany of the settlers are young extremists whose views go beyond even the far-right ideology of the government. They are not generally operating on direct orders from Israel\u2019s military leadership. But they know the military frequently looks the other way and facilitates their actions.\n\nIn many cases, it is the military that forces Palestinians to evacuate or orders the destruction of their homes once settlers drive them to flee.\n\n-----\n\n[Here is a copy of the article]( if you want to read the rest and cannot access the original page. \n\n-----\n\n###Additional reading regarding settlers in the West Bank:\n\n* [Israel\u2019s Cabinet approves 19 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank]( (Associated Press)\n* [The volunteers putting their bodies between Israel settlers and a Palestinian village]( (The Guardian)\n* [Israeli settlers attack Palestinians with impunity, halting West Bank olive harvest]( (PBS)\n* [West Bank violence is soaring, fueled by a capitulation of Israeli institutions to settlers\u2019 interests]( (The Conversation)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/20/world/middleeast/west-bank-settlements.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "IDF says West Bank troops kill 2 Palestinians who attacked them; footage raises questions", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-says-west-bank-troops-kill-2-palestinians-who-attacked-them-footage-raises-questions/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Zelensky hails \u201cvery positive\u201d first meeting with Poland\u2019s Nawrocki", "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has met with his Polish counterpart Karol Nawrocki for the first time since Nawrocki took office in August.\n\nWhile Nawrocki has taken a less friendly approach towards Kyiv than his predecessor, Andrzej Duda, today he declared that his meeting with Zelensky was \u201ca sign that we are together\u201d and was \u201cbad news for Moscow\u201d, their common enemy.\n\nThe Polish president said that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about \u201cbuilding good neighbourly relations\u201d, while Zelensky likewise said that he \u201cfeels very positive\u201d following the talks, which he believes can \u201copen a new stage in relations\u201d.\n\nAfter arriving in Warsaw on Thursday evening, Zelensky met with Nawrocki at the presidential palace on Friday morning \u2013 first for one-on-one talks before moving to broader discussions involving their respective delegations.\n\nSpeaking afterwards at a joint press conference, Nawrocki said that Zelensky\u2019s \u201cvisit is proof that, on strategic issues of security cooperation, Poland, Ukraine, the countries of the region and countries steeped in democratic values \u200b\u200bare united, and this has never been in doubt\u201d.\n\nIn particular, he identified \u201cneo-imperialist\u201d Russia as a shared threat, including through its \u201chybrid operations\u201d against Poland that have included airspace violations and acts of sabotage against infrastructure.\n\nNawrocki, who is a close ally of Donald Trump, also emphasised that \u201cpeace \\[between Russia and Ukraine\\] will not be achieved without the involvement\u201d of the US president. \u201cDonald Trump is the only leader in the world ready to force Vladimir Putin to sign a peace agreement.\u201d\u00a0\n\nNawrocki noted that Poland was one of the strongest international supporters of Ukraine after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive humanitarian and military aid.\n\nHowever, he said that \u201cPoles have the impression that our efforts and assistance to Ukraine were not properly appreciated or understood\u201d and that he had conveyed this to Zelensky during their \u201ctough, honest, yet very pleasant and gentlemanly conversation\u201d.\n\nThe Polish president also noted that their talks had encompassed closer economic cooperation, including the involvement of Polish firms in the postwar reconstruction of Ukraine and\u00a0[Poland\u2019s aims to act as a hub](\u00a0supplying natural gas to Ukraine and other neighbouring countries.\n\nSpeaking after Nawrocki, Zelensky thanked his host for the invitation and also \u201cthanked the entire Polish nation for its support for Ukraine, for Ukrainians, since the beginning of the invasion\u201d.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that this visit opens a new, even more meaningful stage in our relations,\u201d said Zelensky. \u201cUkrainian independence and Polish independence are the foundation that enables every nation in our part of Europe to live freely \u2013 without Moscow\u2019s rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why it is essential that we cooperate, support one another, and coordinate our efforts to defend Europe and our nations,\u201d he added, noting that Ukraine is\u00a0[providing Poland with technology and know-how](\u00a0relating in particular to drone defence.\n\nBoth presidents also touched upon the difficult legacy of massacres during World War Two in which Ukrainian nationalists killed around 100,000 ethnic Poles. The issue has long soured otherwise strong relations between Warsaw and Kyiv.\n\nEarlier this year, the two countries announced a diplomatic breakthrough that would allow the resumption of exhumations of the remains of tens of thousands of victims that remained buried in unmarked graves in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, progress has been slow so far, with most of Poland\u2019s exhumation requests not yet approved by Ukraine. The heads of both countries\u2019 Institutes of National Remembrance attended today\u2019s talks, and Nawrocki urged them to push ahead on the issue.\n\nZelensky, meanwhile, said that he would \u201ccontinue to support\u201d exhumations. \u201cEach of the victims deserves our Christian respect. We should reach an understanding in this regard and commemorate these victims in an appropriate manner.\u201d\n\nDuring his election campaign, Nawrocki made a number of comments that raised concern in Ukraine, including\u00a0[declaring](\u00a0that he \u201ccannot envision\u201d Ukraine joining the EU or NATO until the issue of World War Two massacres is resolved.

He even suggested that a \u201ccrypto-dictatorship\u201d was being established in Poland.\n\nThe decision has been condemned by justice minister Waldemar \u017burek, who called the judge\u2019s argumentation \u201castonishing\u201d and accused him of \u201ca lack of objectivity\u201d.\n\nPolish prosecutors want to charge Romanowski over 11 alleged crimes \u2013 including participating in an organised criminal group, using crime as a source of income, and abuse of power \u2013 from his time as a deputy justice minister in the former Law and Justice (PiS) government.\n\nHowever, after an\u00a0[arrest warrant was issued](\u00a0for him in December last year, it turned out that Romanowski had fled to Hungary, whose ruling Fidesz party is an ally of PiS. The politician was then\u00a0[granted political asylum](\u00a0later the same month.\n\nMeanwhile, Warsaw\u2019s district court issued an EAW for Romanowski. Hungary has, however, refused to comply with the warrant, as it argues that Romanowski would not receive a fair trial in Poland. That prompted a diplomatic row which resulted in Poland\u00a0[withdrawing its ambassador](\u00a0from Budapest.\n\nToday, Romanowski\u2019s lawyer, Bartosz Lewandowski, announced on social media that the same judge at the same court has now withdrawn the EAW. Lewandowski shared extracts of the judge\u2019s justification for his decision.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible not to note the extremely dangerous interference of the highest-ranking representatives of the executive branch in the sphere of judicial independence, an unprecedented phenomenon for a democratic state governed by the rule of law,\u201d wrote the judge, \u0141ubowski.\n\nHe said that there had been \u201ccontinuous public statements regarding ongoing court proceedings and the issuing of judgments before they have been issued by the court\u201d. This, he added, is \u201cviolates the most fundamental human rights of all accused persons, namely the presumption of innocence\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2026considers it completely unjustified to publicly present the image of Marcin Romanowski as a guilty person who, after being brought to the country, will be convicted and imprisoned,\u201d added \u0141ubowski.\n\nSuch \u201cvile statements are incompatible with the basic standards of a democratic state of law\u201d and \u201cdirectly infringe on the sphere of judicial independence\u201d. Therefore, \u201cthere are serious concerns that the current situation in Poland could be classified as a crypto-dictatorship\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn this situation, continuing to uphold the EAW against a leading opposition representative, after he has been publicly \u2018convicted\u2019 by the most important representatives of the executive branch, would result in a complete loss of credibility of the Polish justice system,\u201d concluded the judge.\n\nThe decision was welcomed by Romanowski, who declared that \u201cthe narrative of \\[Prime Minister Donald\\] Tusk\u2019s gangsters and their lies\u2026is completely falling apart\u201d.\n\nIt means that Romanowski is free to move within the European Schengen area without fear of arrest.
