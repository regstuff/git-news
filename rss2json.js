However, if I essentially did two forward passes and two generation passes and subtracted the log probabilities of the two (ratio2 representing the forward log probs and ratio3 representing the forward log probs) which means the generations and forward processes are not sochastic.

Far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition have pledged to bring down the government should he end the war.\n\nSeveral news outlets, [including CNN]( have reported on the late July demands made by Netanyahu, but this is the first time the Israeli document has been obtained in full.\n\nAmong the 11th-hour demands, according to the newspaper, was that Israel retain control of the Egypt-Gaza border area \u2013 a condition Netanyahu has since portrayed as non-negotiable, including at a press conference on Wednesday. \n\nOn July 25, a senior US Administration official told CNN that negotiators were \u201ccloser than we\u2019ve ever been\u201d and that it was \u201cup to the Israelis to accept it.\u201d\n\nYedioth Ahronoth reported that rather than accepting that proposal, the Israeli negotiators submitted new demands, making changes to the proposals they themselves had originally made.\n\nThe new demands were nicknamed the \u201cNetanyahu Outline,\u201d the newspaper reported.", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/middleeast/netanyahu-derailed-hostage-deal-in-july-intl/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scientists invent filter to remove 'forever chemical' PFAS and use it in renewable batteries", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-05/scientists-invent-pfas-filter-for-battery-technology/104308214", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Olympic athlete Rebecca Cheptegei dies after petrol attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vx0kq2xr2o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thoughts and experiences with Personally Identifiable Information (PII, PHI, etc) identification for NER/NLP?", "summary": "Hi,\n\nI am curious to know what people's experiences are with PII identification and extraction as it relates to machine learning/NLP. \n\nCurrently, I am tasked with overhauling some services in our infrastructure for PII identification. What we have now is rules-based, and it works OK, but we believe we can make it better.\n\nSo far I've been testing out several BERT-based models for at least the NER side of things, such as a few fine-tuned Deberta V2 models and also gliner (which worked shockingly well). \n\nWhat I've found is that NER works decently enough, but the part that is missing I believe is how the entities relate to each other. For example, I can take any document and extract a list of names fairly easily, but where it becomes difficult is to match a name to an associated entity. That is, if a document only contains a name like \"John Smith\", that's considerable, but when you have \"John Smith had a cardiac arrest\", then it becomes significant. \n\nI think what I am looking for is a way to bridge the two things: NER and associations. This will be on strictly text, some of which has been OCR'd, but also text pulled from emails, spreadsheets, unstructured text, etc. Also I am not afraid of some manual labelling and fine-tuning if need be. I realize this is a giant topic of NLP in general, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience in this and has any insights to share.\n\nThank you!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1f8ylm6/thoughts_and_experiences_with_personally/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Excavators Dug Up an Ancient Burial Chamber About 4,000 Years Ago in a U.K. National Park", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a61985354/cist-burial-tomb-devon-dartmoor-national-park/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Emmanuel Macron chose Michel Barnier as prime minister", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/05/french-president-emmanuel-macron-nominates-michel-barnier-as-the-countrys-new-prime-minist", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Charles Barkley keeps $1M promise after 2 New Orleans students solve Pythagorean Theorem", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nola.com/news/education/st-marys-academy-charles-barkley-donation/article_802b8d5e-6ae4-11ef-8882-0b48ce188fbb.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
