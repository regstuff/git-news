[\n\nRecently I have posted links to 2 repos [ and [ not because they are anything great just showing how easy it is to write some training scripts and employ the great opensource they are based on.\n\nThat you can build simple broadcast-on-wakeword sensors on lowcost esp32-s3 that use opensource low compute filters such as [ of $2 low cost analogue active mics max9814 with $2 soundcards that will run on sbc to pc.  \nOf software that is being actively ignored for 5 years that where spoken in depth on multiple times on the old Rhasspy forums and elsewhere.  \nThe OHV focus is product based that are actually inferior in use, inferior as they buy in proprietary hardware and blackbox models in preference to great opensource that has been ignored now for 5 years.  \nOpensource that should run equally well on easy maker product of low cost raspberry PiZero2 or ESP32-S2 if imported into the more supported onnx based esp-dl.\n\nQuite simply as its been mentioned on multiple times beamforming and TSE with a system that is local that requires central high compute for ARS/TTS/LLM is being ignored that state of the art beamforming and TSE (targetted speech extraction) is available as opensource and its being purposely ignored that it can run centrally and be shared by multiple cheap array sensors or single mics.\n\nVarious vendors are just pushing inferior product cloning consumer smart speakers purely with a focus of the $ duplicate redundant function can create, in a locked in form that is inferior to what opensource can do.\n\nFor 5 years its been very possible to create broadcast-on-wakeword microphones or arrays that use simple low compute filters to deliver mic streams to MVDR/TSE central processing.  \nThe products they supply are even worse as they take a 2mic array ignore the 2nd channel and with no processing feed direct into a ASR.\n\nIts so sad that a supposed leading opensource package has such poor methods and hardware that it actively promotes the big tech moat they have in terms of voice tech, as opensource is painted as inferior by product choice.  \nWe have the opensource its been available for years but what is being offered has actually gone backwards and its embarrassing for Linux to have such poor offerings such as [ when such great opensource of state of art beamforming and TSE is available and has been for many years.\n\nHA is great OHV is a snakeoil show of ignoring great opensource unless it can be refactored and rebranded as the devs own or use totally proprietary methods, developed with zero consultation or collaboration and hoisted onto the OpenSourcefoundation thats only purpose would seem to be a process to rubber stamp these totally not opensource standards as only HA uses them anyway and no-one else ever will as opensource standards.  \nThe sheer qty of standard linux audio frameworks and great opensource software ignored for sub standard proprietory python creations swap big supported herds into bottlenecks of single devs.\n\nThat the great initial focus of HA of bridging all these terrible proprietary home automation protocols into a singular opensource package seems to be running in reverse with OHV.\n\nThe closing of issues, denial and false claims, this fan based tech club that has members faking reviews and being toxic to criticism, will likely continue...  \nSadly though they can not fake the closed monolithic product offerings ignoring what caused HA to grow or its purely the devs are inept and bereft of ideas that they don't know how to employ in many cases already complete and ready to use opensource.\n\nWhat i find more annoying especially as it fits so neatly into the HA sensor mantra that broadcast-on-mic sensors spoken about many times are equally ignored for many years now even if extremely simple to employ and use cutting edge beamforming and TSE centrally of shared compute that is already required for ASR/TTS and maybe LLM.\n\nI made a decision a while back of seeing great opensource being ignored for years then see it arrive refactored and rebranded as own in SpeechToPhrase which if you have been a Voice geek dev like me really you will know its the Wenet-LM solution that got ignored even though advocated on multiple times. unfortunately its not a singular decision it is one that happens time and time and again that at least with me its decision causes so much confusion I can see only a singular reason of self interest to why its employed.\n\nI pretty much said the same on the HA forums on how simple low cost wall and ceiling sensors can use low cost Pizero2/Esp32-s3 to form cutting edge central compute MVDR &amp; TSE speech enhancement.  \nThat a voice pipeline is an end2end architecture so that endpoint ASR need to be trained with data of their input and its that simple.  \nI refuse to be involved as I am very passionate about opensource and what I am seeing is definitely damaging.  \nI don't have to do anything as I have no interest in making product especially cloned commercial e-waste.  \nEvery day great opensource is ignored, methods of simple sensors and central processing ignored in preference to badly working plastic, just paints an ever clearer picture of what is truly happening.  \nIf you are not vocal then you are complicit and everyday great opensource is ignored and simple maker product it just becomes more evident.  \nThat after such long periods the only thing that can not be ignored is that it is deliberate.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1qlxr7x/ohv_is_a_snakeoil_show/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Repatriate the gold\u2019: German economists advise withdrawal from US vaults | Germany", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/24/repatriate-the-gold-german-economists-advise-withdrawal-from-us-vaults", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More than 4.7m social media accounts blocked after Australia\u2019s under-16 ban came into force, PM says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/jan/15/australia-u16-social-media-ban-millions-accounts-blocked", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Wiper malware targeted Poland energy grid, but failed to knock out electricity", "summary": "", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel aims to ensure more Palestinians are let out of Gaza than back in", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-aims-ensure-more-palestinians-are-let-out-gaza-than-back-2026-01-23/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Korea launches landmark laws to regulate artificial intelligence", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2026/01/22/tech/south-korea-ai-startups-law/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran rejects UN rights resolution condemning protest killings", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/24/iran-rejects-un-rights-resolution-condemning-protest-killings", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Royal Navy tracks Russian warship escorting oil tanker through English Channel", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/russian-ship-english-channel-navy-b2906449.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Starmer pulls Chagos bill after backlash", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2026/01/23/starmer-pulls-chagos-deal-following-trump-backlash/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland plans to end special support for Ukrainian refugees", "summary": "Poland\u2019s government has approved a bill that would end the special support provided to Ukrainian refugees, which was put in place after millions began to arrive in 2022 following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Almost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland today.\n\n\u201cAfter almost four years, the situation is more stable,\u201d said government spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka at a press conference on Tuesday, announcing the plans. \u201cWe are no longer dealing with such a large, simultaneous wave of refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost \\[Ukrainian refugees\\] residing in Poland are working; their children are attending school,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we can now phase out these extraordinary measures and move from temporary solutions to systemic ones.\u201d\n\nIn March 2022, Poland put in place special measures to support Ukrainian refugees, who were at the time entering Poland in huge numbers. Since then, the legislation has been repeatedly extended.\n\nHowever, last year it was the subject of a political dispute between the government and newly elected President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nIn August, Nawrocki\u00a0[vetoed a government bill](\u00a0extending support on existing terms, arguing that it unjustly \u201cprivileged\u201d Ukrainians over other groups. In the end, he and the government\u00a0[reached a compromise](\u00a0that extended support until March 2026 but made access to certain benefits contingent upon employment.\n\nThe president also made clear that it was the last time he would approve an extension of special support for Ukrainians. \u201cWe need to switch to normal conditions, i.e. treating Ukrainian citizens in Poland in the same way as all other foreigners,\u201d said his chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki.\n\nThe new measures, which were agreed by the government on Tuesday but must still be approved by parliament and the president, would go into force in March 2026. They would end some forms of special support for Ukrainians immediately, while phasing out others by March 2027.\n\nInstead, the legislation would introduce \u201ca single, coherent support system for all foreigners covered by temporary protection in the EU, regardless of citizenship\u2026includ\\[ing\\] equal access to benefits, the labour market and healthcare\u201d,\u00a0[says](\u00a0Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s office.\n\nOne element of the bill would see \u201ca gradual transition of healthcare to principles similar to those applicable to Polish citizens (\\[through\\] contributions and insurance)\u201d,\u00a0[says](\u00a0the interior ministry.\n\nUkrainian refugees without healthcare insurance would be treated the same as uninsured Polish citizens. There would be exceptions for children, pregnant women, victims of violence, and wounded soldiers.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, special measures put in place to help Ukrainian children adapt to Polish schools \u2013 such as Polish language classes, preparatory courses and simplified rules for hiring intercultural assistants \u2013 will be removed at the end of the current academic year.\n\nMeanwhile, the provision of accommodation and food would be restricted to particularly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.\n\nThe current right of Ukrainians to establish a business under special rules \u2013 i.e. the same conditions applicable to Polish citizens \u2013 will also be terminated, notes the\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*\u00a0daily.\n\nSome human rights groups have warned that the proposed new measures go too far, and could leave some vulnerable groups without protection and even at risk of homelessness.\n\nThe Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) argues that an element of the bill giving those wishing to obtain support a 14-day deadline to apply for a Polish identity number contravenes EU law. They also note that, for some Ukrainians, obtaining the necessary documentation may be hard due to the war in their homeland.\n\nThe office of Poland\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights has raised similar objections, reports\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lewiatan Confederation, a business lobby representing large employers,\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0the fact that the planned measures will limit the possibility of hiring Ukrainians under a simplified procedure.\n\nThey warn that this could \u201cparalyse the labour\u201d market, noting that Ukrainians constitute around 66% of the million or so foreign workers in Poland.\n\nLewiatan also criticised the fact that temporary protection would be removed from foreigners who leave Poland for more than 30 days, noting that the bill does not make any exception for employees posted abroad by Polish companies.\n\nThe bill could still be amended while it undergoes work in parliament, where the government has a majority. Once approved by parliament, Nawrocki would have the choice of signing it into law, vetoing it, or sending it to the constitutional court for review.\n\nWhile the initial mass arrival of Ukrainian refugees in Poland in 2022 prompted a mass outpouring of support from Poles, many of whom hosted refugees in their own homes, sentiment has recently been turning against them.\n\nA\u00a0[poll published this month](\u00a0by state research agency CBOS showed that the proportion of Poles opposed to accepting Ukrainian refugees has risen to 46%, the highest level ever recorded.\n\nIn September, a United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska found that 37% of Poles negatively view the presence of Ukrainians in Poland, up from 29.5% two years earlier.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/21/poland-plans-to-end-special-support-for-ukrainian-refugees/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU court rejects Poland\u2019s appeal against \u20ac68.5 million coal mine fines", "summary": "The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has rejected a final appeal by Poland against the \u20ac68.5 million in fines it was forced to pay by the European Union for failing to suspend activity at the Tur\u00f3w coal mine during an environmental dispute with the Czech Republic.\n\nThe ruling now brings the long-running case to a close.\n\nThe dispute dates back to 2021, when Prague filed a complaint to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) over Poland\u2019s expansion of operations at Tur\u00f3w, an open-cast mine near the Czech border. It argued that Poland had acted in violation of EU law and its actions would cause environmental damage.\n\nAs an interim measure, the CJEU\u00a0[ordered the mine to suspend operations](\u00a0for the duration of the court proceedings. Poland refused to comply, arguing that the continued operation of the mine and the nearby power plant that it supplies, which produced 7% of Poland\u2019s electricity, was crucial for energy security.\n\nAs a result, the CJEU in September 2021\u00a0[ordered](\u00a0Poland to begin paying daily fines of \u20ac500,000 until it complied. Poland then refused to pay those fines, leading the European Commission to\u00a0[deduct the money]( \u20ac68.5 million in total, from Poland\u2019s EU funds.\n\nIn 2022, after it had\u00a0[reached an agreement](\u00a0with the Czech Republic to end the dispute over the mine, Poland launched a complaint to the CJEU against the European Commission\u2019s actions.\n\nIt argued that the agreement with Prague meant the fines could be cancelled retroactively and that the commission\u2019s decision to deduct the money was therefore unlawful. The fines had been issued before the agreement with Prague, but the commission took the money after the agreement had been reached.\n\nIn 2024, one part of the CJEU, known as the General Court,\u00a0[rejected Poland\u2019s complaint]( It found that the removal of the case from the court\u2019s register following the settlement with the Czech Republic did not relieve Poland of the obligation to settle the fines already accrued.\n\nAlthough the case had originally been brought by Poland\u2019s former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, which ruled until December 2023 and regularly clashed with Brussels, its current more pro-EU government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, still decided to appeal the ruling.\n\nThat appeal was heard by the European Court of Justice, which is the second part of the CJEU. In a ruling issued on Thursday, the ECJ rejected Poland\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe obligation to pay the daily penalty\u2026is intended to ensure compliance with the interim measures already ordered, to preserve the full effectiveness of the future final decision, and thus to guarantee the effective application of EU law in the general interest,\u201d wrote the court.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the parties to the dispute, including the conclusion of a settlement agreement, cannot have the effect of retroactively varying, annulling or setting aside an order imposing such a periodic penalty payment,\u201d it added.\n\nAt the time of writing, Poland\u2019s government had not yet commented on the ruling. However, Anna Zalewska, a former PiS government minister and now member of the European Parliament, used it as an opportunity to criticise European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n\u201cThe European Commission does not intend to return to Poland the \u20ac68 million in fines for refusing to suspend coal mining at the\u00a0Tur\u00f3w\u00a0mine,\u201d wrote Zalewska on social media. \u201cThe reasons for removing von der Leyen \\[from her position\\] are increasing day by day.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/22/eu-court-rejects-polands-appeal-against-e68-5-million-coal-mine-fines-2/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Sudan army chief gives soldiers seven days to crush rebellion", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0nn0dvg6jo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Africa Watch \u2013 Uganda mutes internet as International trade booms", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2026/01/africa-watch-uganda-mutes-internet-as-us-trade-booms/#gsc.tab=0", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
