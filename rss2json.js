The task is as follows: user enters a query, most probably, single keyword. The system should return topk semantically similar, related keywords to the user.   \nI have trained Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText. These static models have their advantages and disadantages. For a production-level performance, I think, a lot more data is required for static models than pre-trained BERT-like models. So I decided to work on pre-trained BERT models.\n\nMy setup is as follows: I\u2019m starting from a pretrained Korean BERT that was trained on diverse sources (Wikipedia, blogs, books, news, etc.). For my project, I continued pretraining this model on Korean news data using the MLM objective. The news data includes around 155k news articles from different domains such as Finance, Economy, Politics, Sports, etc. I have done basic data cleaning such as removing html tags, phone numbers, email, URLS, etc. The tokenizer stays the same (around 32k WordPieces). I trained klue-bert-base model for 3 epochs on the resultant data. To do similarity search against the user query, I needed a lookup-table from my domain. From this news corpus I extracted about 50k frequent words. To do so, I did additional pre-processing on the cleaned data. First, I used morpheme analyser, Meab, and removed stopwords of around 600, kept only POS tags -Nouns, adjectives and Verbs. Then, I did TF-IDF analysis and kept the 50K words with the higest score. TF-IDF helps to identify what words are most important for the given corpus. For each word, I tokenize it, get the embedding from BERT, pool the subword vectors, and precompute embeddings that I store in FAISS for similarity search. It works fine now. But I feel that the look-up table is not diverse enough. To increase the look-up table, I am going to generate another 150K words and embed them too with the fine-tuned news model and extend them to the existing table. \n\nMy question is about what happens to those extra 150k non-news words after fine-tuning. Since the pretrained model already saw diverse domains, it has some knowledge of them. But by training only on news, am I causing the model to forget or distort what it knew about other domains? Will those 150k embeddings lose quality compared to before fine-tuning, or will they mostly stay stable while the news words improve?\n\nShould I include some data from those additional domains as well to prevent the model drift its representation for additional domain words? If Yes, how much will be enough?  \nAnother question is, is my approach correct for the project? Is there other approaches out there that I am not familiar with? I have read that SBERT works better for embedding task. But for SBERT, I have no labelled data, thus I am using BERT MLM training. \n\nI will appreciate any comments and suggestions.

Experts have largely attributed the increase to an uptick in Ukrainian attacks that have damaged refineries and forced major facilities offline, thereby tightening supplies.\n\nIn response, the government imposed a temporary ban on gasoline exports for August and September and is now\u00a0considering\u00a0an extension through October.\n\nAccording to the business newspaper Kommersant,\u00a0oil companies may have\u00a0abandoned\u00a0their practice of holding down prices last month\u00a0because they expect the government to retroactively adjust the \u201cfuel damper\u201d subsidy mechanism.\u00a0The damper compensates producers for selling fuel cheaply at home instead of exporting it, but firms normally risk losing payouts if domestic prices rise too far.\n\nSources told the newspaper that officials plan to widen the permitted gap between domestic and export prices, which would allow companies to keep receiving subsidies despite the surge.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russia\u2019s Energy Ministry reportedly\u00a0convened\u00a0to discuss further stabilization measures.
