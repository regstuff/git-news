Declining Stalin\u2019s invitation was unthinkable\u2014and refusing to drink was even worse. Over time, most of his dinner companions developed serious health problems brought on by alcoholism.\n\nThese gatherings gradually morphed into an extension of politics itself. Dinners stretched into late-night parties, and parties often devolved into disasters. While Stalin clearly enjoyed himself, his guests dreaded the ordeal.

However, were Putin to visit Hungary, it is possible he would have to fly over other EU countries that remain committed to the international court.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Radio Rodzina on Tuesday morning, Sikorski was asked what Poland would do if Putin were to seek to fly through its airspace.\n\n\u201cWe cannot guarantee that an independent Polish court will not order a hypothetical plane carrying Putin to be brought down for the suspect\u2019s transfer to The Hague,\u201d said Sikorski, referring to the Dutch city where the ICC is based.\n\nThe Polish foreign minister also criticised Hungary, saying that \u201cthe fact that an EU member state, still bound by the International Criminal Court, invites President Putin is not only distasteful, it also shows that Hungary positions itself not as part of the West\u201d.\n\nHe added that Hungary was also undermining Western unity in other ways, such as by blocking assistance for Ukraine and maintaining high imports of Russian oil. Poland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s most vocal allies since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\n\n\nSikorski\u2019s remarks prompted an angry response from Lavrov, who noted that last week a Polish court had refused to extradite a Ukrainian man suspected of involvement in blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines that brought Russian gas to Germany.\n\n\u201cI heard here that Mr Sikorski threatened that the security of President Putin\u2019s plane\u2026in Polish airspace,\u201d said Lavrov, quoted by news agency TASS, adding that it appears that \u201cthe Poles are now ready to commit terrorist acts themselves\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn Poland, a court officially made a decision justifying the terrorist attack on Nord Stream \u2013 and now the foreign minister is saying that, if a Polish court demands it, it will impede the free movement of the Russian leader\u2019s plane,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nBulgaria, another EU member, yesterday indicated that it would be ready to open its airspace for Putin\u2019s aircraft.\n\n\u201cWhen efforts are made for peace, it is only logical that all sides contribute to making such a meeting possible,\u201d said Bulgaria\u2019s foreign minister, Georg Georgiev, according to Bulgarian news service Novinite.\n\nIn theory, Putin could also reach Hungary without crossing another EU country by flying from the Adriatic Sea over Montenegro and Serbia.\n\nMoscow has not said whether Putin will even attend the proposed summit, or how he would travel if he did. CNN reported on Tuesday that the event may be delayed, citing sources who said a preparatory meeting between the leaders\u2019 top foreign policy aides this week had been postponed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sikorski\u2019s remarks also faced criticism from S\u0142awomir Mentzen, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) group that sits in Poland\u2019s parliament.\n\nMentzen said that threatening to \u201cintercept a plane carrying the president of a nuclear superpower to peace talks\u2026seems quite risky and may have completely unpredictable consequences\u201d.\n\nHe then noted that, when there was talk of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who is also wanted on an ICC warrant \u2013 visiting Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Polish government said that it would\u00a0[guarantee him safe passage](\n\n\u201cWhy does Poland completely ignore the ICC in one case, but in another wants to obey the ICC, even risking retaliation from Russia?\u201d asked Mentzen, who\u00a0[finished a strong third in this year\u2019s presidential election](\u00a0and whose party is currently riding high in the polls.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/10/21/poland-cannot-guarantee-putin-would-not-be-arrested-if-he-flies-through-polish-airspace-to-hungary/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Has anyone got an AI job with a bachelors in linguistics?", "summary": "I\u2019m real interested in linguistics more so the human language/culture aspect, however not so many good paying jobs in that aspect.

Because of renovation works at Schloss Gottorf in Germany, several of their famous bog bodies are being sent on loan to Denmark. Starting this month five of the best preserved bog bodies from Schleswig-Holstein will be exhibited in Silkeborg at the museum where the Tollund Man is kept.\nMost of the bog bodies in this assemblage date to the Iron Age, roughly between 500 BCE and 200 CE. They come from peat bogs in northern Germany and Denmark where the waterlogged, oxygen-poor, and acidic conditions preserved skin, hair, and even clothing. Many show signs of violent deaths or ritual killings, suggesting they were deposited deliberately rather than buried in the usual way. \n\nThe exhibition is called \u201cMoorleichen auf Reisen\u201d (Bog Bodies on the Move), and it brings together remains from both Germany and Denmark. Some of these bodies still have hair, skin and even bits of clothing, thanks to the peat bog chemistry that naturally mummified them.\n\nAmong the ones on loan are the Child of Windeby, the man from Rendsw\u00fchren, the Damendorf man, and the famous Osterby skull with the Suebian knot hairstyle. There are also smaller finds like hair and textile fragments.\n\nWhile Schloss Gottorf is being renovated they\u2019re letting people see them in Silkeborg alongside the Danish bog bodies. It\u2019s probably the largest bog body assemblage ever displayed together in one place.\n\nMore info:\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ocqdar/for_fellow_european_archaeologists_the_worlds/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "LED Light Blasts Cancer Cells and Spares Healthy Ones", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.utexas.edu/2025/10/09/led-light-blasts-cancer-cells-and-spares-healthy-ones/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New England Says Goodbye to Coal as Merrimack Station Powers Down", "summary": "", "link": "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21102025/new-england-merrimack-station-coal-plant-closes/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open Source Alternative to NotebookLM", "summary": "For those of you who aren't familiar with SurfSense, it aims to be the\u00a0**open-source alternative to NotebookLM, Perplexity, or Glean.**\n\nIn short, it's a\u00a0Highly Customizable AI Research Agent\u00a0that connects to your personal external sources and Search Engines (SearxNG, Tavily, LinkUp), Slack, Linear, Jira, ClickUp, Confluence, Gmail, Notion, YouTube, GitHub, Discord, Airtable, Google Calendar and more to come.\n\nI'm looking for contributors to help shape the future of SurfSense!

They're mainstream voices, vanilla, and honestly a bit boring--lacking character or flair. \n\nThis creates a gap. We have tools that can pronounce words clearly, but they don't capture the vast phonetic and prosodic diversity of how English is actually spoken.\n\nI'm thinking about building a synthesis tool capable of generating specific regional and social accents. Not just that, but voices with quirks, unique timbres, slurs, moods, slang, and even speech impediments (eg., lisps, stutters). I'm hoping to capture the richness of regional speech from rural Texas to Lagos, Sydney, Glasgow, or Kyoto. \n\nThe primary applications I'm exploring are:\n\n1. **CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning):** Giving ELL/ESL students exposure to a variety of accents to improve real-world listening comprehension.\n2. **Media/Accessibility:** Providing more authentic and representative voices for storytelling, game development, or content creation.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Do you see a real-world use for it? Would you personally use this or is it just a gimmick?\n* From an application side, do you see other key uses for this kind of tech in the NLP/lang-tech pipeline that I might be missing?\n* From a technical standpoint, what do you see as the main bottleneck? Is it purely data scarcity? Or are there significant modeling challenges in disentangling accent from speaker identity and prosody?\n* Are you aware of existing research, models, or datasets (perhaps low-resource) that are making good progress on this specific problem?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ocvjuq/how_useful_would_tts_with_nonmainstream_voices_be/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bone fossil not evidence Australia's ancient megafauna was killed by humans: study", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2025-10-22/bone-fossil-not-evidence-australian-megafauna-killed-by-humans/105912684", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Woman with Parkinson's disease \"delighted\" after experiencing instant improvement with finger movements while playing clarinet during brain surgery", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq83k7l7jyyo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists Trace Proto-Turkic Presence in Central Anatolia Back 2,600 Years at Kerkenes Mound - Anatolian Archaeology", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.anatolianarchaeology.net/archaeologists-trace-proto-turkic-presence-in-central-anatolia-back-2600-years-at-kerkenes-mound/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy starts five-year jail term", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/former-french-president-nicolas-sarkozy-starts-five-year-jail-term", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
