Article translated in comments ", "summary": "The small excavation trowel gently scrapes away the soil from a slight mound of iron objects.\nArchaeologists from Vejlemuseerne are immersed in the past while thousands of cars speed by on the E45 highway near Hedensted.\n\nAs part of the motorway expansion, a large Iron Age village has been unearthed. What makes it particularly special is the discovery of a massive sacrificial deposit of war equipment dating back approximately 1,600 years.\nThe items were buried in postholes where houses once stood: over 100 lances and spears, eight swords, arrowheads, knives, an axe, and a very valuable chainmail.\n\nThere is so much weaponry that it could have equipped an army of 80-100 warriors, along with about ten officers armed with swords.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fantastic to be part of this excavation and to hold these artifacts in my hands.\u201d\nELIAS WITTE THOMASEN, ARCHAEOLOGIST AND EXCAVATION LEADER, VEJLEMUSEERNE\n\nElias Witte Thomasen, the lead archaeologist for the excavation, explains that there was also a leader who wore chainmail and a neck ring symbolizing power and influence.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fantastic to be part of this excavation and to hold these artifacts in my hands,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-career experience. It\u2019s a tremendous privilege.\u201d\n\nThe find dates back to the 400s, a time when Germanic tribes were fighting among themselves, according to Witte Thomasen.\n\nA Powerful Chieftain with Chainmail Lived Here\n\nThe weapons were found in an Iron Age village inhabited from around 0 to 450 CE by a powerful chieftain.\n\nDuring those years, the settlement grew, creating a so-called cultural layer made up of discarded items such as slaughter waste, pottery, production scraps, and lost objects like dress pins.\n\n\t\u201cWe know that in 400 CE, some people here in the Iron Age had the capacity to gather men around them and go off to participate in warfare,\u201d says Witte Thomasen.\n\nOne of the most unique finds is a chainmail, reserved for the absolute elite. It was extremely costly to produce in the Iron Age because it required significant time and resources.\n\n\t\u201cWe know of about 13 chainmails, all found in bogs or graves. This is the first time one has been found in a settlement,\u201d Witte Thomasen explains.\n\nEvidence of a Powerful Chieftain\n\nArchaeologists also discovered parts of an oath ring, suggesting that a powerful chieftain lived in the Iron Age village. Alongside the extensive weapon sacrifices, they found pieces of at least two distinctive bronze neck rings\u2014symbols of power and influence, likely part of a chieftain\u2019s personal equipment.\n\nInsight into Iron Age Society\n\nThe weapons were placed in the postholes where buildings once stood, either during the construction of the houses or when the houses were abandoned. Archaeologists believe the weapons may have been war spoils won by the chieftain in battle or the army\u2019s own weapons, sacrificed in gratitude for victory in war. Further research will reveal more.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s quite unique, and it offers significant insight into Iron Age societal structure. Now we know that the absolute elite lived here, which we didn\u2019t know before,\u201d says Witte Thomasen.\n\nAccording to the archaeologist, this excavation is exceptional. Few places in Denmark have yielded such large weapon deposits in settlements. This tells a story of local chieftains in the Iron Age who held authority over larger communities.\n\nVejlemuseerne is planning to display parts of this significant find at the Cultural Museum in Vejle starting in early 2025.", "link": "https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/sensationelt-fund-af-vaaben-til-en-mindre-jernalderhaer-gravet-ud-ved-hedensted", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mercadona worker who was fired for eating a \u2018croqueta\u2019 destined for the trash wins legal battle in Spain ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2024/11/18/mercadona-worker-who-was-fired-for-eating-a-croqueta-destined-for-the-trash-wins-legal-battle-in-spain/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "$2M federal dollars awarded to help clear rape kit backlog in Fort Worth", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/2m-federal-dollars-awarded-rape-kit-backlog-fort-worth/3703941/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sport may be a blunt tool of social change, but it\u2019s time to take a stand against Israel | Sport politics", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/22/sport-may-be-a-blunt-tool-of-social-change-but-its-time-to-take-action-against-israel", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Finetuning Multi modal LLMs codes explained ", "summary": "Recently, unsloth has added support to fine-tune multi-modal LLMs as well starting off with Llama3.2 Vision.

Within days, dozens joined her, moving as though possessed, unable to stop despite their exhaustion. By the end of the month, over 400 people were caught up in the inexplicable \"dancing plague.\"\n\nThis bizarre episode baffled the city\u2019s leaders. Believing the cause to be a medical condition they called \"hot blood\" or even a form of divine punishment, they attempted to solve the problem in a way that now seems ironic\u2014they hired musicians to encourage the dancers, thinking they could dance the sickness out of their systems. Instead, the frenzy only grew worse.\n\nSome participants reportedly danced themselves to death from exhaustion, strokes, or heart attacks.\n\nWhat caused this epidemic of movement? Historians have long debated the root of the incident. Some suggest ergot poisoning, a hallucinogenic mold found in damp rye bread, as a potential cause.\n\nOthers believe it was a case of mass psychogenic illness\u2014a form of collective hysteria\u2014triggered by the intense stress and famine that plagued the region during this period. Still, no single explanation fully accounts for the scale and intensity of the event.\n\n\n\nThe Dancing Plague of 1518 remains one of the most perplexing moments in world history, a reminder of how collective fear and social pressures can manifest in bizarre and devastating ways.
