However, PKP says the purchase was necessitated by a failure to prepare for growing passenger numbers by the opposition when it was in power.\n\nOn Wednesday,\u00a0Janusz Malinowski, the CEO of\u00a0PKP Intercity, which is responsible for long-distance rail transport in Poland, announced the purchase of 50 used carriages from DB Fernverkehr, which is owned by German rail operator\u00a0Deutsche Bahn.\n\nMalinowski said that the carriages can be \u201cquickly put into operation\u201d over the first half of 2026, which will help to meet growing passenger numbers. He told news service Forsal that currently, \u201cat certain times, it is difficult to buy tickets\u201d because of demand.\n\nIn the first half of this year, a\u00a0[record 40.4 million passengers](\u00a0travelled with PKP Intercity, which was up 9% on a year earlier and 31% on two years ago. By the end of this year, the figure is forecast to reach 89 million, up from 78.5 million in 2024 and 68 million in 2023.\n\nLast month, PKP Intercity\u00a0[signed the biggest contract](\u00a0for rolling stock in Polish history, ordering 42 double-decker trains \u2013 the first of their kind in Poland \u2013 in a deal worth 6.9 billion zloty (\u20ac1.6 billion). However, those trains \u2013 manufactured in Poland by France\u2019s Alstom \u2013 will not begin to arrive until 2029.\n\nNevertheless, PKP Intercity\u2019s decision to buy second-hand carriages from Germany sparked criticism from the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), Poland\u2019s main opposition party.\n\nPiS MP Micha\u0142 Moskal criticised the operator for \u201cbuying scrap from Germany\u201d instead of using Polish producers. \u201cPoland will become a graveyard for old German wagons,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHis party colleague Jadwiga Wi\u015bniewska said that the deal makes a mockery of Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s claim to be \u201crepolonising\u201d the economy.\n\nIn May, Tusk announced that he had taken action to \u201cimprove the position of Polish contractors and suppliers\u201d in public tenders, mentioning rail investment as one example.\n\nIn response, PKP released a statement saying that its decisions are being made in light of \u201cyears of neglect in expanding the rolling stock capacity, \\[which\\] have led to a serious limitation in the availability of seat supply\u201d.\n\nThey pointed to the fact that tenders to buy the new double-decker trains were cancelled first in July 2023, under the former PiS government \u2013 which ruled Poland from 2015 to 2023 \u2013 and then again in March 2024, under the current Tusk administration.\n\nThe state-owned firm also noted that forecasts made when PiS was in power significantly underestimated demand: the number of passengers PKP Intercity will carry this year will reach the level previously predicted for 2030.\n\nIn light of these issues, seeking to purchase and rent used wagons from foreign markets is a necessary part of the firm\u2019s strategy, which also includes improving repair of existing rolling stock and investing 16.5 billion zloty in purchases from Polish producers.\n\n\u201cWe have placed huge orders with \\[Polish producers\\] Cegielski, Pesa, and Newag,\u201d Malinowski told Forsal. \u201c\\[But\\] we have to wait for a new supply of carriages and now we very quickly need a larger supply of seats, and these carriages \\[bought from Germany\\] will provide it.\u201d\n\nInfrastructure minister\u00a0Dariusz Klimczak echoed this message, writing on social media that \u201cour national carrier is developing at an express pace and catching up on years of backlog\u201d under the former PiS government.\n\nKlimczak also told Forsal that PiS\u2019s criticism is based on their \u201cphobias, which mean that they do not like German trains\u201d.
