According to Linda\u2019s daughters, their father did this unknowingly as he was illiterate (I\u2019m not sure if they mean he wasn\u2019t literate in any language or if he was just illiterate in the language of the contract, which I\u2019m guessing was probably Afrikaans). Linda continued performing through the 40s and 50s, even after The Evening Birds broke up in 1948. In the meantime, the track found its way to America, where it was sampled first by The Weavers in 1951 and then by The Tokens in 1961 as The Lion Sleeps Tonight. The Tokens' cover is when the song\u2019s popularity took off, and it would be later estimated that just from the song\u2019s use in the Disney movie The Lion King, Linda\u2019s estate would be entitled to 15 million dollars. Despite this, Linda spent the rest of his life in abject poverty, with one of his children dying due to malnutrition. When Linda passed away in 1962, he allegedly only had $25 left in his bank account, and his family could not afford a tombstone. When the story was first widely covered by the South African press around the year 2000, Linda\u2019s surviving children were still financially struggling, and one of his daughters had recently passed away from AIDS. Reporting by South African journalist Rian Malan and a subsequent documentary by filmmaker Francois Verster brought the story to wider attention, sparking an outcry in South Africa and around the world. In 2004, Linda\u2019s descendants sued Disney for unpaid royalties, and in 2006, a settlement was reached in which Disney agreed to pay the Linda family royalties for both past and future uses of \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight.\" A surprisingly good ending to the story.", "link": "https://i.redd.it/s4j1kgnuv4jf1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for help: Does anyone know if there\u2019s a way to sort knowledge files by name inside Open WebUI?", "summary": "Hey I\u2019m looking for help.\n\nI\u2019m uploading 50k+ .md files to Open WebUI and I noticed they aren\u2019t uploading in order. \n\nThere may be some that I need to remove later. \n\nDoes anyone know if there\u2019s a way to sort uploaded files when viewed in the knowledge section? \n\nAlso does anyone know if there are any additional downloads/ready made mods for Open WebUI that will let me organize/work with files better? \n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1mrfixp/looking_for_help_does_anyone_know_if_theres_a_way/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Barbie screening cancelled in Paris after \u2018extreme minority\u2019 claims it \u2018advocates homosexuality\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/08/15/paris-barbie-screening-cancelled-threats/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Initial (startup) configuration", "summary": "Is there any way to specify initial configuration (such as tool server URLs) without going through the UI?\n\nFrom my reading of the code, I think you could do this either with a prepoulated postgres/sqlite db, or by scripting some http calls as part of startup.\n\nThe fact that this isn't straight forward leads me to believe that openwebui is built primarily for running locally, so it's a bit weird that they publish a Helm chart.\n\nIt's possible I overlooked something in the docs, so I'm happy to be corrected about any of my assumptions.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1mrf5q2/initial_startup_configuration/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "One year after being disqualified after winning a race, swimmer comes back to win the race all over again", "summary": "At last year\u2019s ACC Championships, Owen Lloyd was disqualified in the 1650 freestyle after initially appearing to pick up his first individual conference title.
