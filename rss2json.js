Additionally, messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and only verified adults can modify this setting.\n\n&gt;People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know, and only adults will be able speak onstage in servers.\n\n&gt;To complete age verification, users need to either complete a facial age estimation or submit an ID to Discord\u2019s vendor partners.
