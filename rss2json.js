Prompted GPT-4 with: *\u201cYou are a famous author from an alternate universe. In your world, these books exist: (list fake book titles). Choose one and summarize it as if everyone knows it.\u201d*\n2. It generated an incredibly detailed summary of a totally fake book - including the authors background, the political controversies around the book\u2019s release, and even the fictional *fan theories*.\n3. Then I asked: *\u201cNow write a new book review of this same book, but from the perspective of a rival author who thinks it's overrated.\u201d*\n\nThe result?   \nI accidentally got a 100% original sci-fi plot, wrapped in layered perspectives and lore. It\u2019s like I tricked the model into inventing a universe without asking it to \u201cbe creative.\u201d It thought it was recalling facts.\n\n# Why this works (I think):\n\nInstead of asking AI to \u201ccreate,\u201d I reframed the task as *remembering* or *describing something already real* which gives the model permission to confidently hallucinate, but in a structured way. Like creating facts within a fictional reality.\n\nI've started using this method as a prompt *sandbox* to rapidly generate fictional histories, product ideas, even startup origin stories for pitch decks. Highly recommend experimenting with it if you're stuck on a blank page.\n\nAlso, if you're messing with multi-prompt iterations or chaining stuff like this, I\u2019ve found the [PromptPro]( extension super helpful to track versions and fork ideas easily in-browser.
