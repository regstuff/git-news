[\n\n\n\nRecently I have posted links to 2 repos  and  not because they are anything great just showing how easy it is to write some training scripts and employ the great opensource they are based on.\n\n\n\nThat you can build simple broadcast-on-wakeword sensors on lowcost esp32-s3 that use opensource low compute filters such as [ of $2 low cost analogue active mics max9814 with $2 soundcards that will run on sbc to pc.\n\n\n\nOf software that is being actively ignored for 5 years that where spoken in depth on multiple times on the old Rhasspy forums and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe OHV focus is product based that are actually inferior in use, inferior as they buy in proprietary hardware and blackbox models in preference to great opensource that has been ignored now for 5 years.\n\n\n\nOpensource that should run equally well on easy maker product of low cost raspberry PiZero2 or ESP32-S2 if imported into the more supported onnx based esp-dl.\n\n\n\nQuite simply as its been mentioned on multiple times beamforming and TSE with a system that is local that requires central high compute for ARS/TTS/LLM is being ignored that state of the art beamforming and TSE (targetted speech extraction) is available as opensource and its being purposely ignored that it can run centrally and be shared by multiple cheap array sensors or single mics.\n\n\n\nVarious vendors are just pushing inferior product cloning consumer smart speakers purely with a focus of the $ duplicate redundant function can create, in a locked in form that is inferior to what opensource can do.\n\n\n\nFor 5 years its been very possible to create broadcast-on-wakeword microphones or arrays that use simple low compute filters to deliver mic streams to MVDR/TSE central processing.\n\n\n\nThe products they supply are even worse as they take a 2mic array ignore the 2nd channel and with no processing feed direct into a ASR.\n\n\n\nI will let that sink in from the 'future of opensource voice' to claims that this is a 'opensource sonos 1', it merely uses a single mic with no processing to ASR.\n\n\n\nThat what you read and see in the community is just part of the same snakeoil story.\n\n\n\nIts so sad that a supposed leading opensource package has such poor methods and hardware that it actively promotes the big tech moat they have in terms of voice tech, as opensource is painted as inferior by product choice.\n\n\n\nWe have the opensource its been available for years but what is being offered has actually gone backwards and its embarrassing for Linux to have such poor offerings such as [ when such great opensource of state of art beamforming and TSE is available and has been for many years.\n\n\n\nHA is great OHV is a snakeoil show of ignoring great opensource unless it can be refactored and rebranded as the devs own or use totally proprietary methods, developed with zero consultation or collaboration and hoisted onto the OpenSourcefoundation thats only purpose would seem to be a process to rubber stamp these totally not opensource standards as only HA uses them anyway and no-one else ever will as opensource standards.\n\n\n\nThe sheer qty of standard linux audio frameworks and great opensource software ignored for sub standard proprietory python creations swap big supported herds into bottlenecks of single devs.\n\n\n\nThat the great initial focus of HA of bridging all these terrible proprietary home automation protocols into a singular opensource package seems to be running in reverse with OHV.\n\n\n\nThe closing of issues, denial and false claims, this fan based tech club that has members faking reviews and being toxic to criticism, will likely continue...\n\nThat when you state the reality of the fake badly functioning plastic e-waste they produce, that its impossible an unprocessed mono mic stream can provide the claims and has continued sales they just delete the post as above.\n\n\n\nSadly though they can not fake the closed monolithic product offerings ignoring what caused HA to grow or its purely the devs are inept and bereft of ideas that they don't know how to employ in many cases already complete and ready to use opensource.\n\n\n\nWhat i find more annoying especially as it fits so neatly into the HA sensor mantra that broadcast-on-mic sensors spoken about many times are equally ignored for many years now even if extremely simple to employ and use cutting edge beamforming and TSE centrally of shared compute that is already required for ASR/TTS and maybe LLM.\n\n\n\nI made a decision 4 years, to not comment and just watch what would be done and it been painful seeing great opensource being ignored for years then see it arrive refactored and rebranded as own in SpeechToPhrase which if you have been a Voice geek dev like me really you will know its the Wenet-LM solution that got ignored even though advocated on multiple times. unfortunately its not a singular decision it is one that happens time and time and again that at least with me its decision causes so much confusion I can see only a singular reason of self interest to why its employed.\n\n\n\nI pretty much said the same on the HA forums on how simple low cost wall and ceiling sensors can use low cost Pizero2/Esp32-s3 to form cutting edge central compute MVDR &amp; TSE speech enhancement.\n\n\n\nThat a voice pipeline is an end2end architecture so that endpoint ASR need to be trained with data of their input and its that simple.\n\n\n\nI refuse to be involved as I am very passionate about opensource and what I am seeing is definitely damaging.\n\n\n\nI don't have to do anything as I have no interest in making product especially cloned commercial e-waste.\n\n\n\nEvery day great opensource is ignored, methods of simple sensors and central processing ignored in preference to badly working plastic, just paints an ever clearer picture of what is truly happening.\n\n\n\nIf you are not vocal then you are complicit and everyday great opensource is ignored and simple maker product it just becomes more evident.\n\n\n\nThat after such long periods the only thing that can not be ignored is that it is deliberate.\n\n\n\nSorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/smarthome.", "link":

In some cases, they were sentenced to death for trafficking drugs in return for the promise of just a few hundred dollars.\n\nHis mother says the families of those on death row receive little help from their embassies and cannot afford to pay for lawyers to argue for more lenient sentences. \u201cWe are poor and live day by day,\u201d she says.\n\nHuman rights groups describe their trials as \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and \u201cinvolving confessions extracted under torture\u201d.\n\nShazly had once told his mother of a dream he had: people were trying to kill him, but he had miraculously escaped. \u201cThis is a message from God that he will save you,\u201d she told him.\n\nBut after his appeal failed, Shazly told his mother not to hire a new lawyer. \u201cKeep this money for my sisters. If I am destined to die, I will die,\u201d he told her.\n\nOn 16 December, she had been waiting for his daily call, but when her phone rang, it was not Shazly. It was his cellmate.\n\n\u201cHe \\[his cellmate\\] told me that the guards had come and taken Essam at eight o\u2019clock in the morning and that his last words had been a request for forgiveness from his family; me, his father and his two sisters. He told me to pray for him.\u201d\n\nShazly spent his final days in one of the country\u2019s [most notorious prison ]( in the northern Saudi city of Tabuk. So many people transferred there were executed last year that inmates nicknamed it the \u201cdeath wing\u201d. Shazly told his mother they went for days without seeing daylight. \u201cMom, we don\u2019t see the sun,\u201d he told her.\n\n  \nIn December 2024, there were 33 Egyptians on the wing, including Shazly, all facing execution for non-violent drug offences. Just over a year on, just six are alive.\n\nUp until the end, his mother says she held out hope that her son would have his sentence commuted to a prison term. \u201cI was counting the days, thinking that if he is not executed this year, then maybe there is hope.\u201d\n\nA plea for clemency, filed as late as last November, highlighted serious inconsistencies in his confession. In one statement, Shazly said he was unaware of what was in the baggage found next to him in the sea; yet in another, he appeared to describe the quantities and contents of the drugs.\n\nHis clemency petition also noted that Shazly had suffered from severe depression and had been admitted to a mental health facility in Egypt before being arrested by Saudi officials. His mother says he had temporarily been admitted to hospital while in Tabuk after refusing to eat the meals provided at the prison.\n\n\u201cI think, for a while, he wasn\u2019t eating at all. He told me afterwards, when he had got out of hospital and recovered a little, that he wanted to die.\u201d\n\nAs she mourns her son\u2019s death, there will be no final chance for his mother to say goodbye at his funeral. The legal action charity Reprieve says Saudi Arabia does not return the bodies of those executed or inform families of their burial place.\n\n[Saudi officials said]( last month that they would continue to impose the \u201cseverest penalties prescribed by law against drug smugglers and traffickers, given the loss of innocent lives, the grave corruption it inflicts on youth, individuals and society, and the violation of their rights\u201d.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/26/death-penalty-saudi-arabia-executions-essam-shazly-human-rights", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018I\u2019m on the right side of history\u2019: ICIJ member Roman Anin stripped of his Russian citizenship", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.icij.org/news/2026/01/im-on-the-right-side-of-history-icij-member-roman-anin-stripped-of-his-russian-citizenship/?utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iranian ships deliver jet fuel, urea to Myanmar junta", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/graphics/IRAN-MYANMAR/JET-FUEL/jnpwkonqrpw/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ban phones throughout the school day, Phillipson tells teachers", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk827r8mrzo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "South Sudan army threat to 'spare no-one' condemned", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79rjjr481zo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia Promises \u2018Proven, Safe\u2019 Nuclear Power for Indonesia", "summary": "", "link": "https://jakartaglobe.id/news/russia-promises-proven-safe-nuclear-power-for-indonesia", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Daily Watch \u2013 Nigerian officers to face military trial for coup plot, DRC plans first Eurobond issue worth $750M", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2026/01/daily-watch-nigerian-officers-to-face-military-trial-for-coup-plot-drc-plans-first-eurobond-issue-worth-750m/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Commission designates WhatsApp as Very Large Online Platform under the Digital Services Act", "summary": "", "link": "https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-designates-whatsapp-very-large-online-platform-under-digital-services-act", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'It\u2019s okay to be antisemitic': Holocaust survivor says antisemitism would push her out of UK", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-884531", "author": "None"}, {"title": "As Generals Fall, Xi Jinping\u2019s Anti-Corruption Campaign Is Eating Itself", "summary": "", "link": "https://foreignpolicy.com/2026/01/26/xi-generals-zhang-youxia-anti-corruption-china/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
