The analysis highlights how Vietnam enjoys **preferential trade agreements and deeper US market access**, while **India faces tariff barriers and strategic arm-twisting in defense procurement**. The **forced shift to US crude** has imposed additional costs on Indian refineries, eliminating Iran\u2019s previous trade advantages. Additionally, the **US-India defense relationship remains skewed**, with India paying a premium for American weapons while struggling with **delayed offsets**. The conclusion emphasizes the **step-brotherly treatment of India** and questions whether India should **impose reciprocal tariffs** to counterbalance these trade pressures. All sources mentioned in-line.\n\nAnalysis Begins:-\n\nIndia's manufacturing sector has made significant strides, particularly in the auto industry, where we are now a global leader in compact and affordable vehicles. Our core industrial base continues to expand, with growing steel, electronics, and defense production contributions.\n\nHowever, despite these achievements, India faces persistent trade imbalances and strategic pressures from the US, which has often exploited its leverage instead of fostering fair trade.\n\n# Indo-US Trade vs. US-Vietnam Trade\n\nWhile Washington frequently lectures India on trade barriers, it conveniently overlooks its preferential treatment of Vietnam (refer **BTA**), a country with less economic weight than India. The US has inked favorable trade agreements with Vietnam, allowing it significant market access, while India continues to face tariffs and restrictions (removal of GSP benefits) on key exports. It is another thing that Vietnam immensely benefits with RCEP and CPTPP, from which India is out of, however, since the USA too is not a party to either of these two trading agreements, it'll be kept out of discussion.\n\n[US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement 2000](  \n[US Withdrawal of GSP Benefits to India](\n\nResult: Vietnam's exports to the U.S. in 2023 were valued at $118 billion, whereas India's were at $83.8 billion. Vietnam has seen an annualized export growth rate of 18.7%, compared to India's 54.4% absolute growth over the past five years. This indicates significant preferential market access for Vietnam over India.\n\nIndia and Vietnam are competitive in the following sectors:\n\n* **Textiles and Garments**: Vietnam's exports of knit and non-knit apparel to the U.S. totaled approximately $17.21 billion in 2022. India, with its robust textile industry, could have potentially captured a share of this market with better access.\n* **Footwear**: Vietnam exported $9.66 billion of footwear to the U.S. in 2022. India, being a significant footwear producer, might have increased its U.S. market share, but the loss of GSP benefits hurt India particularly.\n* **Furniture**: Vietnam's furniture exports to the U.S. were valued at $10.04 billion in 2022. India's growing furniture industry could have benefited from better market access.\n\nAdding up the total figures, the opportunity cost totals nearly **$37 billion** at the *higher side* for India annually!\n\n# Strategic Arm-Twisting\n\nThe Modi government has repeatedly faced American pressure, especially on defense deals. Notable instances include:\n\n* The $930 million deal for six Apache helicopters is an inflated price tag compared to what other nations pay.\n\n[UK Apache AH-64E Deal for $3 billion i.e. $60M/unit](  \n[India Apache Deal for $930 million i.e. $155M/unit and nearly a decade old deal](\n\n* The NASAMS air defense system sale was effectively pitched to India in exchange for a CAATSA waiver on the S-400 purchase from Russia. Timelines of both were coinciding. Thankfully, India backed out of the negotiations, prioritizing its own multi-tiered Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) program over NASAMS II. While these things are popularly dubbed as a *balancing act*, what it ultimately does is cater to one-time lobbying and burn the Indian taxpayer's money.\n* The extremely expensive Predator drones, where India pays far more per unit than even the LCA Tejas Mk 1A. Operationally speaking, 31 UAVs will not change the outcome of a war. Tech transfer of neither know-how nor know-why. Interestingly, the price of 3 such UAVs exceeds the total cost of the Tapas project.\n\n[Predator Deal Unfiltered Analysis](\n\n* Crippling domestic Indian indigenization efforts concerning the Tejas program by delaying actuators and engines. On top of that, having the audacity to pitch a 50-year-old platform, albeit with upgrades, and rebranding it as F-21 and now the F-35 drama. While HAL indeed has its inefficiencies, which are exacerbated by the Air Force's frequent design change requests, poor planning (like making a big ask for an all-in-one jet for cheap), and delayed funding of the Central Government; the present issue of actuators and engines is solely an American impediment.\n\n[Does F-21 meet India's needs](\n\n[Tribune India Report on US Restrictions Delaying Tejas Delivery](\n\nIn a nutshell, India has significantly upped the game in military-industrial policy by being a baby arms exporter. However, the fact remains that critical platforms like fighter aircraft, tanks, submarines, and ships (the navy doing relatively better though) have a good amount of dependency which would need a thoughtful and sound strategy to overcome esp. in the backdrop of China developing its 6th-gen fighters and arming Indian neighbors left and right. For France, Israel, and Russia have proven to be much better in co-developing defence products (e.g. Brahmos and Barak-8), and reliable and battle-proven French arms respect Indian strategic autonomy much better than the USA while Russia is the sole provider of SSBNs to India. However, all of them, with the US in particular, have so far dishonored the offset clause (which in itself has been severely diluted with G2G deals, the route for most US arms sales to India, being exempt since 2020).\n\n[India's MoD threatens to ban US Company warns 11...](\n\n[Dilution of Offset Clause (last para of report)](\n\n# Khalistan, Northeast &amp; Obama's Statement\n\nIndia's concerns over Khalistani extremism in the US remain largely ignored, with Washington giving free rein to separatist elements under the pretense of free speech.\n\nAmerican (CIA) interference in trying to prop up neo-Christian states' separatist movements (like Nagalim for Jesus) in the Northeast is well-known and doesn't need any introduction.\n\n[CIA Northeast - 1](\n\n[CIA Northeast - 2](\n\n[IB Officer warns of CIA-ISI involvement in Northeast](\n\nVery recently Obama's unnecessary comments on minority rights coming right after Modi's state visit highlighted a pattern of unwarranted interference in India's internal affairs.\n\n# US Crude Exports &amp; Its Impact on India's Refining Industry\n\nIndia's purchase of American crude, made under geopolitical pressure, has disrupted domestic refineries. The Mangalore Refinery, originally optimized for Iranian crude, had to be reconfigured at high costs, as Iranian crude is heavy-sour while American shale oil is light-sweet, necessitating radically different processes such as crude distillation unit adjustments, desulfurization processes, and recalibrating the hydrocracking unit. Additional freight charges further increase this economic burden.\n\n[Moody's Report on Iran Sanctions Impact on Oil Refiners](\n\n*Estimating Opportunity Cost of Switching from Iran to US*\n\nIndian refineries, especially Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), were optimized for Iranian crude, which is heavy-sour. American shale, being light-sweet, implies expensive modifications. I have taken a guess-estimate of $500 million, this reconfiguration is documented in ONGC's annual reports as well, which is publicly available \\[refer to Moody's report and surf the net for more\\]. This will increase if funded with loans, which is usually the scenario with surprise capex.\n\nIndia benefited from low shipping costs due to proximity to the Persian Gulf than the Gulf of Mexico (or America lol), implying an additional freight cost of $2-$3/barrel.\n\nConcerning payment terms, with Iran, India enjoyed credit benefits (60-90 days) giving cash flow benefits worth millions annually and often with a good rupee component (if not in entirety), reducing forex outflow. Whereas with the US, India needs to make immediate dollar payments, increasing strain on forex reserves and working capital.\n\n**Conclusion on Oil Trade**\n\nThe forced shift to US crude not only raised immediate costs but also eliminated the financial advantages India enjoyed with Iran. The total opportunity cost exceeds $1 billion per year, when including infrastructure adjustments, and knock-on effects on refining efficiency and forex reserves' outflow.\n\n**Question: Should India rethink its crude sourcing strategy, especially with Iran eager to resume exports? Let's discuss...**\n\n# Market Access &amp; GSP Hypocrisy\n\nThe US revoked India's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status, citing our economy's \"growth.\" When the program was still in place, countries like Bangladesh, with a similar or even higher GDP per capita, continued to enjoy these benefits. Meanwhile, China, despite a GDP per capita 5x over India, was also removed, but its deep economic integration with the US protects it from the kind of targeted pressure that India faces as well.\n\n[Congressional Research Service Report on GSP](\n\n# Conclusion on US Step-brotherly Treatment\n\nThe United States has long benefited from access to India's growing consumer market while restricting Indian exports and dictating terms on defense and energy. While both India and Vietnam have strengthened their export relationships with the U.S., Vietnam's rapid export growth and diversification, bolstered by BTA benefits, have positioned it favorably in the U.S. market. Restoring GSP-like/preferential trade benefits for India could enhance its competitiveness, particularly in sectors where it competes with Vietnam, potentially increasing its share in the U.S. import market. At present, India is facing two scenarios: either reduce existing tariffs OR don't budge.\n\nEach scenario presents distinct challenges and opportunities. Reducing tariffs could enhance consumer choice and drive domestic industries toward greater competitiveness but may expose vulnerable sectors to heightened competition. Conversely, maintaining current tariffs risks U.S. retaliation, potentially harming export-driven industries and straining economic relations. A balanced approach, possibly involving strategic tariff reductions coupled with support for affected domestic sectors, might mitigate adverse impacts while fostering a more open trade environment.\n\nThis U.S.A. policy is ostensibly soundbites as India among the top 20 trading partners has one of the most balanced trade relations with the U.S.A. and American strategy to prop up a strong India to contain China in the Indo-Pacific seems to be countering American policy. This incoherence is not a first but a feature of *American diabolicalism*.\n\n**Let's discuss: Should India start levying strategic tariffs on US goods to counterbalance these pressures?
