Google A2A + this Python package might actually fix that", "summary": "If you\u2019re working with multiple AI agents (LLMs, tools, retrievers, planners, etc.), you\u2019ve probably hit this wall:\n\n- Agents don\u2019t talk the same language  \n- You\u2019re writing glue code for every interaction  \n- Adding/removing agents breaks chains  \n- Function calling between agents? A nightmare\n\nThis gets even worse in production. Message routing, debugging, retries, API wrappers \u2014 it becomes fragile fast.\n\n---\n\n### A cleaner way: Google A2A protocol\n\nGoogle quietly proposed a standard for this: **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**.  \nIt defines a common structure for how agents talk to each other \u2014 like an HTTP for AI systems.\n\nThe protocol includes:\n- Structured messages (roles, content types)\n- Function calling support\n- Standardized error handling\n- Conversation threading\n\nSo instead of every agent having its own custom API, they all speak A2A. Think plug-and-play AI agents.\n\n---\n\n### Why this matters for developers\n\nTo make this usable in real-world Python projects, there\u2019s a new open-source package that brings A2A into your workflow:\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [**python-a2a (GitHub)**](  \n\ud83e\udde0 [**Deep dive post**](\n\nIt helps devs:\n\n\u2705 Integrate any agent with a unified message format  \n\u2705 Compose multi-agent workflows without glue code  \n\u2705 Handle agent-to-agent function calls and responses  \n\u2705 Build composable tools with minimal boilerplate\n\n---\n\n### Example: sending a message to any A2A-compatible agent\n\npython\nfrom python_a2a import A2AClient, Message, TextContent, MessageRole\n\n# Create a client to talk to any A2A-compatible agent\nclient = A2AClient(\"\n\n# Compose a message\nmessage = Message(\n    content=TextContent(text=\"What's the weather in Paris?\"),\n    role=MessageRole.USER\n)\n\n# Send and receive\nresponse = client.send_message(message)\nprint(response.content.text)\n\n\nNo need to format payloads, decode responses, or parse function calls manually.  \nAny agent that implements the A2A spec just works.\n\n---\n\n### Function Calling Between Agents\n\nExample of calling a calculator agent from another agent:\n\njson\n{\n  \"role\": \"agent\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"function_call\": {\n      \"name\": \"calculate\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"expression\": \"3 * (7 + 2)\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe receiving agent returns:\n\njson\n{\n  \"role\": \"agent\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"function_response\": {\n      \"name\": \"calculate\",\n      \"response\": {\n        \"result\": 27\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nNo need to build custom logic for how calls are formatted or routed \u2014 the contract is clear.\n\n---\n\n### If you\u2019re tired of writing brittle chains of agents, this might help.\n\nThe core idea: **standard protocols \u2192 better interoperability \u2192 faster dev cycles**.\n\nYou can:\n- Mix and match agents (OpenAI, Claude, tools, local models)\n- Use shared functions between agents\n- Build clean agent APIs using FastAPI or Flask\n\nIt doesn\u2019t solve orchestration fully (yet), but it gives your agents a common ground to talk.\n\nWould love to hear what others are using for multi-agent systems. Anything better than LangChain or ReAct-style chaining?\n\nLet\u2019s make agents talk like they actually live in the same system.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jvdtih/multiagent_ai_systems_are_messy_google_a2a_this/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - pyoneerC/Free_Games_Tracker: Discover limited-time free games across all platforms.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/pyoneerC/Free_Games_Tracker", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Apple Exported $17 Billion in iPhones From India Last Year, Minister Says - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/apple-exported-17-billion-in-iphones-from-india-last-year-minister-says", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian Kidnapping and Re-Education of Ukraines Children", "summary": "", "link": "https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/fact-sheet-russias-kidnapping-and-re-education-of-ukraines-children/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jeffrey Sachs warns India against turning anti-China to win US favour - CNBC TV18", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/jeffrey-sachs-warns-india-against-turning-anti-china-to-win-us-favour-19586977.htm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anyone experienced with pushing large spacy NER model to github?", "summary": "I have been training my own spacy custom NER model and it performs decently enough for me to want to integrate it into one of our solutions.
