I have talked with some and they have mentioned that NLP and MT is a largely graduate field of study, so I would be interested in grad school if it let me pursue it further.

DALL-E 3 now generates longer blocks of text more accurately.\r\n\r\n2/ Comparing DALL-E 3 with Midjourney, Ideogram, and GPT-4o examples, GPT-4o seems to be far ahead in terms of prompt following and text rendering, despite the improvements made to DALL-E 3 and other image generators.\r\n\r\n3/ It'll be interesting to see how specialized models evolve if they are indeed outperformed by large multimodal models in their domain, such as audio, video, or images. This trend may favor large players such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI that have the resources to develop and deploy the largest multimodal models.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1djgg4o/openai_upgrades_dalle_3_instead_of_rolling_out/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India, US to initiate new cooperation in quantum tech, biomanufacturing; announce collaboration on telecommunication", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/india-us-to-initiate-new-cooperation-in-quantum-tech-biomanufacturing-announce-collaboration-on-telecommunication20240618091302/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "BA in English Linguistics aspiring to take Master in CL/Language Technology ", "summary": "Hi everyone, I have BA in English Linguistics but I find it a bit difficult to get a proper career with this degree. With the emergence of AI and all that stuff related to it, I think I would have a better career if I take Master in CL/Language Technology. The issue is I don't have any knowledge yet about programming and computer science. I have done a little research and found some programmes in Swedish universities that include introductory courses on programming and math and stats. But I'm still unsure if it's enough to master them in just one semester and If I could really keep up with the programmes.\n\nAny opinions on this is appreciated. Thx!
