We are designing a concept for AI-powered smart glasses that uses AR overlays to display translated text in real time for English Language Learners. The goal is to make education more equitable, accessible and inclusive for all.\n\nOur concept for the smart glasses is purely conceptual as we will not actually be creating a physical prototype or product.\n\nHere is our concept:\u00a0\n\nWe will develop wearable language translator smart glasses that are powered by a GPT engine which uses speech recognition and voice recognition technology, enabling users to speak in their native language. The smart glasses automatically translates what is said into English and displays on the lens using AR overlays to display the text in real time. There will be a built-in microphone that will detect the spoken language, and will capture real-time speech and transmit it to the Speech-to-Text (STT) system. Using Neural Machine Translation (NMT) technology (what Google Translate uses), the text will be sent to the GPT model to process NMT results through Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT or BERT) for cultural and idiomatic accuracy, ensuring nuanced communication.\n\nAs speech recognition technology is not very good for people with accents and is biased toward North American users, we can use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to train the GPT model using diverse datasets that include different accents, speech patterns and dialects, which we will collect from audio samples. We can also use Adaptive Learning (AL) algorithms to fine-tune voice recognition technology so the GPT model recognizes the user's voice, speech patterns, dialects, pronunciation, and accent. We will mitigate bias using a bias-free models such as BERT.\n\nWe will also collaborate with corporations and governments ensures ongoing funding and resources, making the program a long-term solution for English language learners across Canada and beyond.\n\nSome features of our smart glasses are:\n\n\\- The glasses will create denotative translations that breaks down phrases into its literal meaning (e.g. 'it's raining cats and dogs' would be translated to 'it's raining hard') so that English language learners can understand English idioms or figures of speech.\u00a0\n\n\\- The smart glasses also would have an app that can be paired with the smart glasses using bluetooth or a wifi connection. The app would act as a control hub and would have accessibility features, settings to change the font size of the text that will be displayed on the lenses, volume, etc.\n\n\\- The smart glasses would also allow users to view their translations through the app, and allow them to add words to their language dictionary.\n\n\\- There would also be an option for prescription lenses through a partnership with lensology.\n\nWould anyone be interested in this? I would love to hear your thoughts and perspective! Any insight is greatly appreciated. We are using human-centered design methodologies and would love to learn about your pain points and what frustrates you about learning English and studying in an English-speaking institution as an international/exchange student.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1hnlb9p/would_you_try_smart_glasses_for_language_learning/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What second language should I take in college ", "summary": "I need 4 semesters of a second language and i did want to take italian, but my family says german would be the most useful.
