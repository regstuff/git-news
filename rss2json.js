Today, Rev is building on that foundation with Reverb, the world's #1 ASR model for long-form transcription \u2013 now open-source.\n\nWe see the power of open source in the AI and ML world. Llama has fundamentally changed the LLM game in the same way that Whisper has fundamentally changed the ASR game. Inspired by Mark Zuckerberg's recent post on how open source is the future, we decided it is time to adapt to the way users, developers, and researchers prefer to work.\n\nI am proud to announce that we are releasing two models today, Reverb and Reverb Turbo, through our API, self-hosted, and our open source + open weights solution on GitHub/HuggingFace.\n\nWe are releasing in the following formats:\n\n* A research-oriented release that doesn't include our end to end pipeline and is missing our WFST (Weighted Finite-State Transducer) implementation. This is primarily in Python and intended for research, exploratory, or custom usage within your ecosystem.\n* A developer-oriented release that includes our entire end-to-end pipeline for environments at any scale. This is the exact on-prem and self-hosted solution our largest enterprise customers use at enormous scale. It is a combination of C# for the APIs, C++ for our inference engine, and Python for various pieces.\n* A new set of end-to-end APIs that are priced at $0.20/hour for Reverb and $0.10/hour for Reverb Turbo.\n\n# What makes Reverb special?\n\n* Reverb was trained on 200,000+ hours of extremely high quality and varied transcribed audio from Rev.com expert transcribers. This high quality data set was chosen as a subset from 7+ million hours of Rev audio.\n* The model runs extremely well on CPU, IoT, GPU, iOS/Android, and many other platforms. Our developer implementation is primarily optimized for CPU today, but a GPU optimized version will be released this year.\n* It is the only open source solution that supports high quality realtime streaming. We will be updating our developer release soon to contain our end-to-end streaming solution. Streaming is available now through our API.\n* The model excels in noisy, real-world environments. Real data was used during the training and every audio was handled by an expert transcriptionist. Our data set includes nearly every possible real-life scenario.\n* You can tune your results for vertabimicity, allowing you to have nicely formatted, opinionated outputs OR true verbatim output. This is the #1 area where Reverb substantially outperforms the competition.\n* Reverb Turbo is an int8 quantization of our base model that reduces model size by over 60% while only having a \\~1% absolute WER degradation.\n\n# Benchmarks\n\nHere are some WER (word error rate) benchmarks on Rev's various solutions for Earnings21 and Earnings22 (very challenging audio):\n\n* Reverb\n   * Earnings21: 7.99 WER\n   * Earnings22: 7.06 WER\n* Reverb Turbo\n   * Earnings21: 8.25 WER\n   * Earnings22: 7.50 WER\n* Reverb Research\n   * Earnings21: 10.30 WER\n   * Earnings22: 9.08 WER\n* Whisper large-v3\n   * Earnings21: 10.67 WER\n   * Earnings22: 11.37 WER\n* Canary-1B\n   * Earnings21: 13.82 WER\n   * Earnings22: 13.24 WER\n\n# Licensing\n\nOur models are released under a non-commercial / research license that allow for personal, research, and evaluation use. If you wish to use it for commercial purposes, you have 3 options:\n\n* Usage based API @ $0.20/hr for Reverb, $0.10/hr for Reverb Turbo.\n* Usage based self-hosted container at the same price as our API.\n* Unlimited use license at custom pricing. Contact us at [licensing@rev.com](mailto:licensing@rev.com).\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nI highly recommend that anyone interested take a look at our fantastic technical blog written by one of our Staff Speech Scientists, Jenny Drexler Fox. We look forward to hearing community feedback and we look forward to sharing even more of our models and research in the near future.
