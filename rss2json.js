In the wake of protests in Iran, Washington has threatened to strike; violence in Gaza continues despite a cease-fire; Hezbollah is rearming in Lebanon; and factional rivalries are destabilizing Syria. But the next front to explode may be one that policymakers keep treating as an afterthought\u2014the West Bank. Since Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023, massacre and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza, the Israeli government has mounted a de facto annexation drive, stepping up its military presence in the West Bank, exerting sustained pressure on the Palestinian Authority (PA) to weaken it, accelerating the approval of Jewish settlements, and retroactively legalizing illicit outposts. Acts of violence perpetrated by settlers have become a near-daily occurrence.\n\nThen, on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet approved an extraordinary set of measures that convert the ongoing de facto annexation of the West Bank into de jure policy. The move\u2019s timing was especially brazen, coming just ahead of yesterday\u2019s visit to the White House by Netanyahu. Israel will ease limits on land sales to settlers and assume the power to decide how land is used in areas A and B, which had officially been under PA rule. The goal, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared, is to \u201ckill the idea of a Palestinian state.\u201d\n\nThis move is only the latest development that has brought the West Bank to the brink of outright crisis. The PA could become functionally insolvent within months, ending the provision of basic services to millions of Palestinians and aborting a security-cooperation effort with Israel that, until now, has prevented widespread unrest. Ramadan begins next week, an event that historically inflames tensions around the al-Aqsa compound in East Jerusalem\u2014known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount. Shifts in Israeli policing that weaken restraints on provocative behavior, paired with the absence of effective external mediation channels to help de-escalate tensions, creates a real risk that sacred\u2011site incidents could spark wider unrest.\n\nThe fact that these flash points exist is no accident. It is an Israeli strategy. Influential Israeli government ministers have long argued that the West Bank must be folded into Israel\u2019s political and administrative orbit. Since October 7, Smotrich and other right-wing Israeli leaders have exploited the fog of war to turn this vision into policy.\n\nIf the annexationists\u2019 momentum is not checked very soon, their cumulative acts will increase the odds of renewed unrest, necessitate sustained Israel Defense Forces (IDF) mobilizations, deepen Israel\u2019s diplomatic isolation, and force Israel to shoulder the burdens of civil governance in the West Bank.\n\nIt would also fatally undermine implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 20\u2011point peace plan for Gaza, which depends on a reformed PA returning to govern that territory. Already, conditions on the ground are rendering the stabilization of the territory impossible\u2014and creating the conditions for it to become an irrevocably permanent insurgency zone.\n\nIsrael\u2019s security establishment operates in the West Bank according to a set of uneasy but functional principles: prevent Hamas from taking over, contain violence through intelligence, and rely on the PA\u2019s security forces as a partner (however flawed those forces may be) to keep a large\u2011scale, coordinated insurgency from taking hold.\n\nYet parts of the Israeli government are working to undo these security gains by destabilizing the West Bank and weakening the very institution\u2014the PA\u2014that has helped prevent a sustained uprising.\n\nThese moves do not only increase the number of Israelis living in the West Bank. They are also weakening the PA day by day and radically transforming the territory. The Israeli government has begun generating strategic corridors of control by expanding the boundaries of municipal jurisdictions, creating bypass roads, and linking infrastructure between settlements, making it far harder for Palestinian security forces and political leaders to exert authority in the short term and dismantling any long-term chance that a territorially contiguous Palestinian state could be established.\n\nE1 is not an exception. It is a blueprint. A similar logic underpins new construction projects and zoning plans around Gush Etzion, Ariel, and Maale Adumim: they serve to fortify blocs of Israeli control and fragment Palestinian lands.\n\nPalestinians also face a sharp rise in violence directly perpetrated by Israeli settlers\u2014a kind of violence the Israeli government tacitly approves. Decisions made at the highest level of Israel\u2019s government have empowered these perpetrators.\n\nThe PA is deeply flawed and very brittle. Years of corruption, governance failures, and an inability to negotiate statehood with Israel have eroded its credibility among Palestinians. But Israel needs a better functioning PA, not a more fragile one. So does Trump: his 20-point Gaza peace plan stipulates that a reformed PA will eventually retake authority over Gaza. Torching the PA in the West Bank undermines Gaza\u2019s recovery before it can even begin.\n\nIsrael\u2019s far right seems to believe that destroying Palestinian governance will afford Israel more strength. On the contrary\u2014it is a mistake that will become expensive, bloody, and self-destructive as it accelerates the cycles of resentment and violence.

One of the issues he spoke about extensively was the Volhynia massacres.\n\nAsked if there was a chance for the issue to be removed from political debate and left to academics to discuss, Alferov said that this was \u201cunfortunately unlikely\u201d because \u201cthe Volhynia tragedy is one of Poland\u2019s state myths\u201d.\n\nHe then appeared to correct himself, saying it was \u201cnot a myth, but one of the key elements of the Polish grand narrative\u201d.\n\nBy contrast, \u201cfor most Ukrainians, this is just a local episode of history, because it was only in Volhynia, and the Poles who left later settled throughout Poland\u201d, explained Alferov. Volhynia is a historic region located in what is now northwestern Ukraine, southeastern Poland, and southwestern Belarus.\n\nDuring the Volhynia massacres, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), a partisan formation still celebrated by many in today\u2019s Ukraine, killed ethnic Poles in areas the UPA wanted to be part of a Ukrainian state.\n\nThe majority of victims were women and children, and the massacres were often carried out with particular brutality. Poland has officially recognised the episode as a genocide. However, Ukraine rejects that designation.\n\nIn his interview, Alferov pointed to historical research showing that \u201cover 28,000 Ukrainians were also killed in this conflict \\[with Poles\\]\u201d. He then asked: \u201cCan the events be called genocide if there are victims on both sides?\u201d\n\nLater on Tuesday, Poland\u2019s IPN, a state institution dedicated to documenting Poland\u2019s history during World War Two and the postwar decades of Moscow-imposed communist rule, said that Alferov\u2019s comments were \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Volhynia genocide is a documented fact that cannot be invalidated by the language of narrative, relativisation or political calculation,\u201d wrote the IPN.\n\n\u201cThe scale of the crime does not cease to be a crime simply because it occurred in a specific territory,\u201d they continued. \u201cOver 100,000 murdered Polish citizens \u2013 mostly women, children and the elderly \u2013 is not an \u2018episode\u2019, but rather one of the largest genocides against civilians in 20th-century Europe.\u201d\n\nThe IPN also said that the fact that \u201cthe contemporary Ukrainian state builds elements of its identity on the cult of individuals and organisations responsible for these crimes, rejecting the facts recorded in publicly available historical sources, is also disturbing\u201d.\n\nRecent years have seen moves towards reconciliation between Poland and Ukraine over World War Two history. In an important symbolic moment, the two countries\u2019 then-presidents, Andrzej Duda and Volodymyr Zelensky, in 2023\u00a0[jointly commemorated](\u00a0the 80th anniversary of the massacres.\n\nLast year, Ukraine also\u00a0[lifted its ban on the exhumation of victims](\u00a0of the massacres, tens of thousands of whom are believed to remain buried in unmarked mass graves.\n\nIn his interview, Alferov said that he was \u201csure that, after the permission for the exhumation is granted, the topic will subside over time\u201d. He said that Ukraine had \u201cshown decency by granting permission\u201d for the exhumations to take place.\n\nHowever, in its response to his comments, the Polish IPN warned that \u201ctrue reconciliation can only be based on truth\u201d, including \u201cthe Ukrainian state unequivocally condemning the perpetrators of the Volhynia massacres\u201d.\n\nThe dispute over the massacres is more than just symbolic. In 2024, a Polish deputy prime minister\u00a0[said](\u00a0that Poland would not allow Ukraine to be admitted to the European Union until the two countries \u201cresolve\u201d their differences over Volhynia.\n\nThat position was also expressed last year by the current president, Karol Nawrocki, when, while campaigning for the presidency, he\u00a0[said](\u00a0that he \u201ccurrently does not envision Ukraine in either the EU or NATO until important civilisational issues for Poland are resolved\u201d.\n\nLast year, the Ukrainian government\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0Poland\u2019s plans to establish a new national holiday commemorating victims of the massacres, saying that the idea \u201cflies in the face of the spirit of good neighbourly relations\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/11/poland-criticises-head-of-ukrainian-state-history-institute-for-downplaying-wwii-massacres/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "47\u1d57\u02b0 anniversary of the Iranian Revolution celebrations in Tehran", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/47th-anniversary-of-the-iranian-revolution-celebrations-in-tehran/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjY6bmV3c21sX01UMUFOQURMMDAwMkM1TU1S", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kosovo Parliament Elects Kurti as New PM \u2013 as EU Presses for Reforms", "summary": "[Perparim Isufi]( | [Pristina]( | [BIRN]( | February 12, 2026 10:23\n\n**MPs elect Albin Kurti as Kosovo's new Prime Minister \u2013 as Brussels urges new government to resume stalled reforms and restart the EU-led dialogue with Serbia.**\n\nVet\u00ebvendosje\u2019s leader Albin Kurti was voted Prime Minister of Kosovo on Wednesday evening in a short parliamentary session; 66 MPs in the 120-seat assembly supported Kurti and his cabinet, 49 were against.\n\nThe vote was held soon after parliament elected Vetevendosje\u2019s Albulena Haxhiu as speaker, which opened the way for President Vjosa Osmani to give Kurti a mandate to form a new government.\n\nKurti\u2019s election ends a year-long deadlock during which he failed to get enough support in parliament to form a cabinet in October, followed by the same outcome one month later, when his party colleague, Glauk Konjufca, also failed to get enough votes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn the next four years, we\u2019ll strengthen alliances \\[with the West\\], invest one billion \\[euros\\] in defence, resume the EU intermediated dialogue with Serbia, and \\[make\\] further investment in social welfare, education and infrastructure,\u201d Kurti told MPs, presenting his new cabinet.\n\nShortly after, Kaja Kallas, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called on the new government to move \u201cswiftly on reforms\u201d, which had stalled during the 2025 political crisis.\u00a0\u201cThis is the fastest way \\[for Kosovo\\] to unlock EU support worth hundreds of millions of euros and have progress on its EU path,\u201d Kallas said.\n\nKallas also said now was the time to give the frozen EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia new momentum. \u201cI am ready to host a high-level meeting soon,\u201d Kallas said, in a reference to a potential meeting between Kurti and Serbia\u2019s President, Aleksandar Vucic, which would be the first since September 2023.\n\nThis is Kurti\u2019s third term as Kosovo\u2019s premier.
