(2017) is now ubiquitous across application domains, from natural language processing to speech processing and image understanding. We propose **DenseFormer**, a simple modification to the standard architecture that improves the perplexity of the model without increasing its size -- adding a few thousand parameters for large-scale models in the 100B parameters range. Our approach relies on an additional averaging step after each transformer block, which computes a weighted average of current and past representations -- we refer to this operation as **Depth-Weighted-Average** (**DWA**). The learned DWA weights exhibit coherent patterns of information flow, revealing the strong and structured reuse of activations from distant layers. Experiments demonstrate that DenseFormer is more data efficient, reaching the same perplexity of much deeper transformer models, and that for the same perplexity, these new models outperform transformer baselines in terms of memory efficiency and inference time.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1blp754/denseformer_enhancing_information_flow_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prototyping language apps with Generative AI Studio", "summary": "Does anyone know of any full duplex speech conversational apps for learning that can stay in a European Portuguese accent?

A particularly provocative theory, initially proposed in the 1970s, suggests that early Christianity may have incorporated symbols associated with Dionysus, a deity primarily revered for his connections to madness and fertility. This theory underscores the significance of ecstatic states in the cultural fabric of Ancient Greece, hinting at a complex interplay between religious practices and the quest for transcendental experiences. What do you guys think?\n\n# Who was Bacchus?\n\nBacchus is not merely a god associated with intoxication; rather, he represents the embodiment of the psychoactive potential found in medicinal plants, which were used both recreationally and religiously by the ancient Greeks. This thought-provoking thesis has been championed by American researcher [Carl A.P. Ruck]( a renowned specialist in Dionysian studies whose unconventional views clashed with the established norms of his time during the 1970s.\n\nIn 2021, Brian Muraresky\u2019s [groundbreaking ]( reignited interest in Ruck\u2019s ideas, offering compelling evidence that supported the researcher\u2019s thesis and filled in the gaps that were previously lacking. Recent archaeological findings in Ukraine and advancements in the chemical analysis of biological compounds have further bolstered the credibility of this argument, warranting a fresh defense of Ruck\u2019s work.\n\nThe utilization of [psychotropic]( substances in Greek religious ceremonies is well-documented in ancient texts and archaeological discoveries. Esteemed researchers such as mycologist Robert Gordon Wasson and Carl A. P. Ruck have extensively delved into the botanical origins of these substances. Their investigations have pointed to the possibility that certain plants, like ergot and psilocybe mushrooms, may have been employed in rituals within the cult of [Dionysus](\n\nWhen Ruck initially presented his thesis in the 1970s, the novelty of his proposition faced significant opposition, nearly jeopardizing his career. The notion that classical authors could have been influenced by mind-altering substances was swiftly dismissed by some as sensationalism or even deemed a mere \u201cmyth.\u201d The idea of Plato, one of the great philosophers, being under the influence of a \u201clittle green fairy\u201d was met with incredulity and rejection.\n\nNonetheless, with the accumulation of compelling evidence over the years, it is evident that revisiting and defending Ruck\u2019s thesis is not only worthwhile but necessary to better understand the cultural and spiritual practices of ancient Greece. It reminds us that seeking knowledge with an open mind and embracing new perspectives can lead to profound insights into our shared human history.\n\n## The Mysteries of Eleusis\n\nIn his captivating book \u201cThe Immortality Key,\u201d Brian Muraresku delves into the ancient Eleusis Mysteries held in the Greek city of Eleusis. Muraresku puts forth a compelling hypothesis that these enigmatic rituals involved the consumption of a mysterious psychedelic concoction called \u201ckykeon,\u201d which played a pivotal role in guiding participants through profound spiritual experiences.\n\nThis theory suggests that the psychoactive properties of the potion were instrumental in inducing altered states of consciousness and mystical visions during the ceremonies. Interestingly, historical accounts attribute the senator and philosopher Cicero with describing the [Eleusinian Mysteries]( as the greatest achievement of mankind, even surpassing the renowned Athenian Democracy.\n\nRead More on [Hoppy History](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1bl0q19/debate_was_bacchus_the_god_of_psychedelics/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Italy prime minister Giorgia Meloni seeks \u20ac100,000 damages over deepfake porn videos", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/deepfake-porn-giorgia-meloni-prime-minister-b2515749.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bizarre Claim: Russian Lieutenant Colonel Accuses France of Being Behind the Shooting at Crocus City Hall", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dagens.com/news/bizarre-claim-russian-lieutenant-colonel-accuses-france-of-being-behind-the-shooting-at-crocus-city-hall", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gunmen in combat fatigues fire at crowds at Moscow concert hall, a big blaze follows", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/russia-moscow-gunmen-concert-hall-injuries-fe7db5bb4ad4df17b6cbd04a3250faa1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ramadan and lent", "summary": "I love the idea that the Dhyanlinga and Golden Temple amongst other spaces have of universal religion/accepting all religions.
