Over the past year working on audio applications, we often ran into the same problem: open-source TTS models were either low quality or not fully open, making it hard to retrain and adapt. So we built Muyan-TTS, a fully open-source, low-cost model designed for easy fine-tuning and secondary development.\nThe current version supports English best, as the training data is still relatively small. But we have open-sourced the entire training and data processing pipeline, so teams can easily adapt or expand it based on their needs. We also welcome feedback, discussions, and contributions.\nYou can find the project here:\narXiv paper: \nGitHub: \nHuggingFace weights: \n\n\nMuyan-TTS provides full access to model weights, training scripts, and data workflows. There are two model versions: a Base model trained on multi-speaker audio data for zero-shot TTS, and an SFT model fine-tuned on single-speaker data for better voice cloning. We also release the training code from the base model to the SFT model for speaker adaptation. It runs efficiently, generating one second of audio in about 0.33 seconds on standard GPUs, and supports lightweight fine-tuning without needing large compute resources.\nWe focused on solving practical issues like long-form stability, easy retrainability, and efficient deployment. The model uses a fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2-3B as the semantic encoder and an optimized SoVITS-based decoder. Data cleaning is handled through pipelines built on Whisper, FunASR, and NISQA filtering.\n\nWhy Open-source This?\n\nWe believe that, just like Samantha in Her, voice will become a core way for humans to interact with AI \u2014 making it possible for everyone to have an AI companion they can talk to anytime. Muyan-TTS is only a small step in that direction. There's still a lot of room for improvement in model design, data preparation, and training methods. We hope that others who are passionate about speech technology, TTS, or real-time voice interaction will join us on this journey.
