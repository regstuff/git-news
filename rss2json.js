(Of course, out of India and China it will choose China looking into the past partnerships and common enemies and interests)\n\n- USA will stand neutral and won't support either. (Well, nothing to win or lose in India vs China for them)\n\n- India might have to gather allies which can be Japan and S. Korea both of which oppose China.\n\n- They both will decline partnering with India. (They both are US oriented and will follow up what it does)\n\n- China will gather allies too of course. Pakistan and Myanmar. (Military states are easy to fool as they only talk in power which China has in abundance)\n\n- Soon India will exhaust out of resources and internal funds to manage war on and off fronts. (War likes crazy money, rich will flee to other countries and poor will become poorer and so India will start collapsing internally)\n\n- China will win, a one-sided agreement will be passed to give huge lands in north and eastern sea areas to China.\n\nThe only real way to win this war was to Ally with USA which in turn will have gotten us support from S. Korea and Japan too. This would although result in World War 3 or maybe Asian War 1, but would have benefitted us greatly.\n\nWhy do I think is hard to gather support of USA is because of our current global stance. We pretend to be everyone's friend. Russia vs Ukraine, neutral. Israel vs Palestine, neutral. We are friend of our friend's friends but at the same time friend of our friends' enemies too. This gives us this image of not so trustworthy nation which might turn as per situations benefit us. It is too risky to support such a nation.\n\nFor example, take Israel vs Palestine. Countries who support Israel are often seen as USA friendly by the US as they align with their own ideologies of democracy and liberty. Whereas those who support Palestine are seen as Militant and not USA friendly. India well is establishing a neutral stance so the world won't if we are diplomatic or militant.\n\nSo, the world is not sure of what type of thinking India has. We have to more openly support sides and emphasize on showing the world our ideals. We can't cry on roads asking strangers who don't know us t help only those of our friends we make in long term help us.\n\nCan you agree more??", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1fdgjmk/india_vs_china_tired_of_false_projections_by_news/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Apple's iPhone keynote: AI news recap (spoiler: not much to report)", "summary": "1/ Apple's iPhone keynote revealed limited new features for Apple Intelligence, with the first AI functions coming to iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 in October.
