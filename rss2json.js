One University of Southern California biomedical engineering major wasn't even halfway through college when he developed a software app that significantly improves the way Children's Hospital Los Angeles doctors treat cancer.\n\nWhile college students are busy learning how the world works, 20-year-old Arjun Karnwal is focused on how to make the world work better.\n\n\"I'm always sort of innovation-focused, and I always want to improve things even just by 1%,\" said Karnwal, a junior at USC's Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering.\n\nEven when he attended La Canada High School, Karnwal designed tools to save his teachers' time.\n\n\"I used to kind of make websites to help teach classes better,\" he said.\n\nNow, he's working alongside radiation oncologists at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n\n\"The question is like, where do we put the radiation to have the best effect?\" Karnwal said.\n\nThat's what Karnwal is laser-focused on. Radiation doses are referred to as \"shots.\" He invented a software application named \"ShotCaller.\" It computes in minutes what would take doctors hours to figure out manually.\n\n\"I think it took us about three to four hours to plan, and with Arjun's algorithm, we were able to come up with a plan in under half an hour,\" said CHLA radiation oncologist Dr. Kenneth Wong.\n\nWhen Karnwal came on board as a student volunteer looking for a project, Wong said he asked a lot of questions about the painstaking computations.\n\n\"He was able to take our complex ideas and break them down into simpler steps that a computer could follow,\" Wong said.\n\nKarwal's app comes into play with a new technique called spatially-fractionated radiation. It's how doctors attack large tumors that don't respond to other treatments. The idea is to find the weak spots that'll shrink the tumor.\n\n\"Think of it like you have an Amazon box, and you're trying to pack it full of tennis balls,\" Karnwal said.\n\nBut the math gets more complicated because tumors aren't shaped like rectangles, and doctors have to factor in the spaces needed to avoid healthy tissue and nearby vital organs. Karnwal said it's like fitting as many people as you can into a house, but you have to keep them six feet apart, but then, random furniture gets in the way.\n\n\"It gets really complicated when we're worried about three dimensions too,\" he said.\n\n\nKarnwal's \"ShotCaller\" application not only does in minutes what it used to take doctors hours to do, it's even more accurate.\n\n\"The ShotCaller algorithm is actually better than our human attempts,\" said Wong.\n\nWong said Karnwal's app has eliminated treatment delays and allows his team to efficiently administer a radiation technique that's lengthening lives and reducing pain for his patients.\n\n\"We've received a lot of phone calls from centers interested in Arjun's work,\" he said.\n\nFor Karnwal, that's the greatest reward.\n\n\n\"I think it makes all the late nights and early mornings worth it, and I just feel grateful to have the chance to make something,\" he said.\n", "link": "https://abc7.com/post/usc-student-arjun-karnwal-develops-breakthrough-app-shotcaller-helping-chla-doctors-treat-childhood-cancer-faster/17888851/?ex_cid=TA_KABC_FB&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+New+Content+%28Feed%29&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwZnRzaANFb55leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHsXtsgCahcezgrUCMf4xbODhGYSyFJJJbwXJPxCIX3ZIohMiJyzNESLrER6k_aem_7PT2aYPxdFA313iPaJvqIA#5zj5xet2gvuannxrhz1d7tsyasb0j9mao", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - h2337/ghostscan: A modern, Rust-powered Linux scanner that unmasks hidden rootkits, stealthy eBPF tricks, and ghost processes in one fast sweep", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/h2337/ghostscan", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gaza is History and Palestinians in Gaza Will be History: Waiel Awwad", "summary": "", "link": "https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/israel-gaza-war-palestine-genocide-waiel-awwad-interview/article70064832.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Germany is \u2018reviving\u2019 Nazism, warns Lavrov | FM says there are \u2018clear signs\u2019 of re-nazification in German society, urges world to \u2018pay attention\u2019 as Berlin \u2018shares Hitler\u2019s goals\u2019: \u201cMerz\u2019s attempt to once again make Germany Europe\u2019s main military engine is extremely dangerous and unacceptable\u201d", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article68d8479a88300c7476b9998e/Lawrow-wirft-Deutschland-eine-Wiedergeburt-des-Nazismus-vor.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tens of thousands rally in Berlin against German support for Israel", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/9/28/tens-of-thousands-rally-in-berlin-against-german-support-for-israel", "author": "None"}, {"title": "WHO EMRO - Cholera vaccination campaign launched in Darfur to protect over 1.8 million people", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.emro.who.int/sdn/sudan-news/cholera-vaccination-campaign-launched-in-darfur-to-protect-over-1-8-million-people.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\"Automatic turn based sending\" wanted", "summary": "I am looking for automated chat sending for the first few rounds of chat usage.
