Even when both parties are African and the entire transaction happens in Africa. Why? Colonial legacy plus the perception that English law is sophisticated and their courts are fast.\n\nThe result according to the study is African countries are essentially exporting legal work to London. Their own court systems never develop the case law and experience to handle complex commercial matters. African lawyers lose work. And the enforcement costs (London solicitor rates up to 1000 pounds per hour, flights, visas) often exceed the contract value for African parties.\n\nWe are doing the exact same thing but worse because we actually have the capacity to fix it and we are not. While courts in India have ruled that if both parties are based in India, disputes cannot be outsourced to a foreign country, our system is slow, and people prefer arbitation and for them they go outside  India which is permitted. \n\nSingapore has positioned itself as the arbitration capital of Asia, SIAC (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) handles massive Indian disputes. Their 2022 annual report shows India was the TOP foreign user of SIAC and we are literally their biggest customer. London Court of International Arbitration? Indian parties are consistently in their top 5 users by nationality. Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC), again exploding growth in Indian cases.\n\nA complex international arbitration can easily cost 5 to 10 crore rupees. Sometimes much more. Every single rupee of that goes to Singapore lawyers, London barristers, Dubai arbitrators, foreign expert witnesses, international law firms, zero rupees stay in India. But it gets worse, like the African study documents, when you choose Singapore or English law, you are importing their entire legal framework. Their public policy rules, their insolvency laws, their regulatory approach. Indian companies are unknowingly subjecting themselves to foreign legal systems they do not fully understand.\n\nThe African paper argues it is partly colonial mentality but mostly rational economic choice. African courts are slow and sometimes unpredictable. So businesses pay premium prices for foreign forums. \n\nOur average case takes what, 15 years? Our commercial courts are improving but massive backlog remains. Our judges are overworked, vacancies are not filled on time. So Indian businesses, especially those doing international deals, rationally choose Singapore arbitration or London courts. We are paying other countries to do what we should be doing ourselves.\n\nThis is not just about money, it is about legal sovereignty and soft power. When Indian companies settle their disputes under Singapore or English law, those legal systems accumulate experience, precedents and expertise in Indian commercial practices. They become more sophisticated, their lawyers develop deep knowledge of Indian business culture, Indian regulatory environment, Indian market dynamics.\n\nMeanwhile our own legal system is starved of this experience, our courts never see these complex cases and our lawyers never develop that expertise, as a result we remain dependent.\n\nThe African study makes this point explicitly. It is a form of continued legal colonization. The colonizer no longer needs to rule you politically. They just need you to voluntarily bring all your important legal disputes to their courts.\n\nSingapore is not our former colonizer but they are absolutely eating our lunch in legal services. And we are serving it to them on a platter. Legal UK published a report in 2021 estimating English law contributes over 25 billion pounds annually to UK economy and a significant chunk of that is from foreign parties (like us) using English law and courts.\n\nSingapore Law Ministry reported legal services sector generated 1.6 billion SGD in 2021. Their explicit strategy is to be the dispute resolution hub for Asia. Meaning they want our disputes,  and Dubai is actively building the same model for Middle East and South Asia.\n\nThe paper's recommendation for Africa was to stop treating foreign forum clauses as sacred. Develop local legal capacity, adapt foreign legal concepts to local needs rather than wholesale adoption and uild confidence in domestic legal institutions.\n\nFor India this means:\n\nActually fix our court backlogs, just showing digitized boards of pending case, won't work. Singapore cases resolve in 12 to 18 months, ours take 15 years and that is the ball game.\n\nAggressively promote Indian arbitration institutions like Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration but also make them actually good, not just marketing. Train our judges in complex commercial law, hire more judges. \n\nDevelop Indian commercial law that is sophisticated and predictable, publish judgments faster. Stop being apologetic about using Indian law and Indian forums, Singapore did not become arbitration hub by being humble, they marketed aggressively and delivered quality.\n\nProfessor Iheme argues in his paper that Anglophone African countries need to step out from the shadow of English law and develop their own legal systems suited to their needs. Not abandon English legal concepts entirely but adapt them and stop the reflexive deference. His methodology is explicitly \"Afrocentric\" meaning he centers African interests and experiences rather than accepting English law as the gold standard.\n\nWe need the same energy using an India centric approach to commercial law and dispute resolution. Not copying Singapore or London but building something suited to Indian commercial reality that also meets international standards.\n\nOtherwise we will still be in this same position in 2050, waiting 15 years for our courts while paying billions to Singapore and London to resolve our disputes faster. The African study is a mirror and we need to look at it honestly.\n\nFull citation for anyone interested: Iheme, Williams C. \"The Overdependence of African Courts and Businesses on English Law and Forum: The Negative Repercussions on the Development of African Legal and Economic Systems\" Pravni Zapisi Vol. 15 No. 1 (2024) pp. 151-190  \n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1on54tk/while_our_courts_take_15_years_per_case_uk/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "5,000-year old 'cultic space' discovered in Iraq dates to time of the world's first cities", "summary": "The buried \"monumental\" structure was discovered in September at the Kani Shaie archaeological site in the northern Sulaymaniyah Governorate, in the foothills of the Zagros Mountains in northern Iraq, according to[ a statement](", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/5-000-year-old-cultic-space-discovered-in-iraq-dates-to-time-of-the-worlds-first-cities", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - mikey177013/NeuralObserver: This project consists of a frontend web application that uses hand tracking for interactive gameplay, paired with a backend server that processes and transmits user data to a Telegram bot.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/mikey177013/NeuralObserver", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fine-tuning LLMs with NVIDIA DGX Spark and Unsloth", "summary": "I've ran into issues trying to get the DGX Spark container to build on my unit.
