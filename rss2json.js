India's again asking for a renegotiation gives me a sense of Deja-vu.  \nNothing has changed in 8 years.   \nI'd like to link the article again for readers to understand the issues involved.   \nSome highlights.\n\nThe next wars may be fought over water. Pakistan (and increasingly India) are among the most water   \nstressed countries in the world. While we want to highlight that Kashmir has changed 5 years after the abrogation of article 370, a reality is that Jammu and Srinagar (which has a river running through it and  \nlakes) have water shortages. \n\nNot using our water resources also means we cannot exploit the power potential of J&amp;K\n\nPakistan also shafts Afghanistan on water, in an unequal river water sharing deal. \n\nThere is the added complication of China. If China restricts water to India, the countries it will affect most  \nare further downstream - Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1foa4n9/iwt_the_worlds_most_unequal_water_treaty/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Judeo-Egyptian complains to King Ptolemy about his neighbor", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/2024-09-22/ty-article/a-judeo-egyptian-complains-to-king-ptolemy-about-his-neighbor/00000192-19ed-dc44-affb-39fda9c80000", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Research Attempts to Bring Literary Machine Translation Closer to Human Quality", "summary": "I read in Slator that some researchers are working on dynamic approaches to increase the lexical diversity in machine translation output. The idea behind this research is that, without lexical diversity, AI-generated translations of literary works will remain subpar.I don't want to blame researchers for trying to solve a non-problem, but I can't help but asking the question \"why the heck would we want literary translation to be AI-driven?\"Literary translation is a call, a passion, a craft, a creative process -- and there is still a large reservoir of young writers/translators who would like to try their hand at literary translation. It is both challenging and rewarding. What will it bring to mankind if machines replaces these bright idealists? I thought the idea behind AI was that it would help us achieve efficiency gains by taking over tedious, repetitive tasks from us so that we would have more time for creative tasks. That's the way I use AI, and I find it useful in that respect. But why train machines to take over creative tasks that bring human literary translators so much satisfaction?  \n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fnmc62/research_attempts_to_bring_literary_machine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kaspersky deletes itself, installs UltraAV antivirus without warning", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaspersky-deletes-itself-installs-ultraav-antivirus-without-warning/amp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sweden says Iran was behind thousands of text messages calling for revenge over Quran burnings.", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/sweden-iran-quran-burnings-revolutionary-guard-309f5f12aac2fc4e9a064bb0ffd313ee", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gene therapy at Duke improves NC dad\u2019s failing vision just in time for his baby\u2019s birth ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbs17.com/community/the-bright-side/gene-therapy-at-duke-improves-nc-dads-failing-vision-just-in-time-for-his-babys-birth/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Woman from 36-week abortion YouTube video to face criminal charges", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240812050617", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pesto the baby penguin is already taller than his parents.
