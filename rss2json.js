Some say it's big, others not so much, but it's definitely getting attention on social media.\n\nI read a few posts about it. Some folks are hopeful, while others think India shouldn't get involved. But I see things differently.\n\nI think now's a good time for India to step in, but not with guns. Here's why:\n\nThe main problem in POK is that stuff like wheat is getting too expensive. So, why not send them some help?\n\nWe could try talking to Pakistan about it, even though they might say no. That way, people in POK would see that Pakistan cares more about its pride than helping them out.\n\nWe could also try sneaking aid into POK. If Pakistan stops us, we can show the world they're blocking us from helping. And if we manage to get aid to POK, it'll make India look good, like what we did in Afghanistan.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, it seems like a win for us. What do you think? Is this plan realistic, or am I being too hopeful?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1csaxxe/can_india_make_a_difference_in_pok/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Doctor still cancer-free almost a year after incurable brain tumour diagnosis - thanks to his own pioneering treatment", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/doctor-still-cancer-free-almost-a-year-after-incurable-brain-tumour-diagnosis-thanks-to-his-own-pioneering-treatment-13135621", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Italy has 3 million fewer young people than 20 yrs ago", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2024/05/15/italy-has-3-million-fewer-young-people-than-20-yrs-ago_856cde66-373a-4ba1-bd97-5168985e8959.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A teenage girl has been cured of a rare and complex medical condition after what doctors called a 'world-first' treatment.
