I am receiving a physical picture later.\n\nIf I place a sliced fruit in front of her picture will I be fine?\n\nAlso I have been doing achala arpanam through the video for quite some time, maybe over 30 days without making fruit offerings. I hope I did not make her angry, as I was lacking understading.

My goal is to categorise all these extracts into relevant groups. Through some research, I've calculated the cosine similarity matrix and fed this into a Agglomerative hierarchical clustering function. I'm currently struggling to figure out a way of visualising the results as well as understanding how to categorise any new text extracts into the existing groups (classification). I'm currently using Transformers.js for my workflow but open to other suggestions. I also attempted this with chat GPT 3.5 and it was somewhat successful but I dont believe it's as reliable/consistent as setting up my own pipelines for feature extraction and clustering.   \n\n\nThanks in advance", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1br7gfb/help_with_workflow_for_content_clustering_and/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "These trailblazing athletes raised the bar for women's sports", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">These trailblazing athletes raised the bar for women's sports</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tL2ludGVyYWN0aXZlLzIwMjQvMDMvc3BvcnQvd29tZW4tYXRobGV0ZXMtdHJhaWxibGF6ZXJzLWNubnBob3Rvcy_SAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-30", "author": "None"}, {"title": "No. 11 NC State upsets No. 2 Marquette, advances to first Elite Eight since 1986", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">No. 11 NC State upsets No. 2 Marquette, advances to first Elite Eight since 1986</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMjkvc3BvcnQvbmNhYS10b3VybmFtZW50LW5jLXN0YXRlLXVwc2V0cy1tYXJxdWV0dGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDMvMjkvc3BvcnQvbmNhYS10b3VybmFtZW50LW5jLXN0YXRlLXVwc2V0cy1tYXJxdWV0dGU?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-30", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Caitlin Clark addresses offer to play in Big3 ahead of Iowa\u2019s Sweet 16 clash with Colorado", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Caitlin Clark addresses offer to play in Big3 ahead of Iowa\u2019s Sweet 16 clash with Colorado</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMjkvc3BvcnQvY2FpdGxpbi1jbGFyay1iaWczLW9mZmVyL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-29", "author": "None"}]}}};
