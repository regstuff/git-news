So, I've been accepted into these two masters programs below, and I'm having a bit of a difficulty choosing between them.\n\nSo, to preface, my background -- I am currently a Philosophy and Linguistics student studying already at the University of Edinburgh, with a bunch of my courses about either Language Technology (e.g. Speech Processing) or philosophy of AI (e.g. Ethics of AI). I would like to go towards academia researching Large Language Models, more specifically on their semantic and pragmatic capabilities.\n\nWith that being said, my choices are:\n\n* University of Edinburgh, MSc Speech and Language Processing\n   * Less prestigious but aligns better with my interests\n* Cambridge University, MSc Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (Advanced Study)\n   * More prestigious but aligns less with my interests.\n\nFor the latter program, I did some research and I came across the Language Sciences Interdisciplinary Programme and the Language Technology Lab, but I don't particularly know how accessible they are to a Masters student, how they actually work, or their experiences.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on which programme to go for! I'd especially appreciate if those that graduated from these two programmes could share their experiences as well.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1juvgic/edinburgh_slp_vs_cambridge_linguistics/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US forges ahead with 104% tariffs on China, says willing to talk to other countries", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/china-criticises-trump-tariff-blackmail-market-turmoil-settles-2025-04-08/?utm_source=reddit.com", "author": "None"}, {"title": "LocalMCP - an Open Source project to interact with MCP servers through cli, gui and api", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Deniscartin/mcp-cli", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AP wins reinstatement to White House events after judge rules government can\u2019t bar its journalists", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/trump-ap-media-court-white-house-events-access-f346a0efe87c1dec4d6f90e6041abd09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "As China &amp; US flex their satellite power, India plays catch-up in a cosmic game of thrones", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/science/as-china-us-flex-their-satellite-power-india-plays-catch-up-in-a-cosmic-game-of-thrones/2581124/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India working on 'military space doctrine', expected to be out in three months, says CDS | TheHindu", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-working-on-military-space-doctrine-expected-to-be-out-in-three-months-says-cds/article69424189.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli military says 15 aid workers in Gaza killed due to 'sense of threat'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-military-says-15-aid-workers-gaza-killed-due-sense-threat-rcna200150", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In Guatemala, painted altar found at Tikal adds new context to mysterious Maya history", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-04-guatemala-altar-tikal-context-mysterious.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India to formalise incentives for critical minerals recycling this year, sources say | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/india-formalise-incentives-critical-minerals-recycling-this-year-sources-say-2025-04-08/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gaza medic deaths just the latest in Israel\u2019s long history of changing its story over civilian killings", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/08/idf-has-long-history-of-denying-involvement-in-civilian-killings", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Red Carpet for an Accused War Criminal: Why Is the I.C.C.
