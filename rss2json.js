Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital for possible treatment options.\n\n\"When Lola was a puppy, I was treated for a brain tumor at the Mayo Clinic,\" said Roth. \"Through my multiple brain surgeries, she was always by my side. When it came time for her cancer treatments, I was thrilled that she would be treated at UC Davis \u2013 what I would call the \u2018Mayo Clinic for dogs.\u2019\"\n\nLola was enrolled in a study that involved immunotherapy treatments through inhaling cancer-fighting drugs called IL-15.\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond well to the treatment during the beginning of the trial and eventually had to be dropped because her tumors began to grow even more.\n\nRoth then enrolled Lola to receive radiation therapy, and though it was able to shrink the tumor inside her mouth, x-rays showed continued tumor growth in her lungs.\n\n\"We thought we were going to lose her that summer,\" Roth said. \"But she hung on all summer, and we did another x-ray in September. All her tumors were gone. No one could believe it. Essentially, Lola had experienced a delayed response to the IL-15 trial.\"\n\n\"In people, immunotherapies can sometimes result in inflammation of tumors, making them appear larger before they shrink,\" said Drs. Robert Rebhun (co-principal investigator of the trial). \"This is termed \u2018pseudoprogression,\u2019 and it appears to have happened with Lola.\"\n\nLola has now been cancer free for two years. She still gets regular check-ups at UC Davis, but so far, none of her tumors have returned.", "link": "https://www.fox29.com/news/dog-given-less-than-6-months-live-cured-cancer-after-clinical-trial?link_source=ta_first_comment&amp;taid=68baba80d6085a00012ba273", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India Sees a Silver Lining Inside Trump\u2019s Tariff Storm", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-06/india-has-a-silver-lining-inside-trump-s-tariff-storm-new-economy-saturday", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why India's Modi skipped Xi's military extravaganza in China: Analysis", "summary": "", "link": "https://breakingdefense.com/2025/09/why-indias-modi-skipped-xis-military-extravanganza-in-china-analysis/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The medical community is thrilled by U.S. support for a 'breakthrough' HIV drug", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5527019/hiv-prevention-drug-breakthrough-aids", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anyone attending EUSIPCO next week?", "summary": "Anyone attending EUSIPCO in Palermo next week?
