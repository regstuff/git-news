I'm building a project that involves a RAG pipeline and the retrieval part for that was pretty easy - just needed to embed the chunks and then call top-k retrieval. Now I want to incorporate another component that can identify the widest range of like 'subtopics' in a big group of text chunks. So like if I chunk and embed a paper on black holes, it should be able to return the chunks on the different subtopics covered in that paper, so I can then get the sub-topics of each chunk. (If I'm going about this wrong and there's a much easier way let me know) I'm assuming the correct way to go about this is like k-means clustering or smthn? Thing is the vector database I'm currently using - pinecone - is really easy to use but only supports top-k retrieval. What other options are there then for something like this? Would appreciate any advice and guidance.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cgmj4v/clustering_embeddings_for_subtopic_extraction_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to do morphological analysis of Japanese text or at least tokenization / word segmentation on an android device?", "summary": "Hi!\n\nI'd like to split a Japanese text into words (or morphemes I guess) on an android device but I'd like to do that on the device. I'd prefer to not have some sort of web service for this. I also don't necessarily need PoS tagging or something like this. Inserting spaces is basically all I really need. The rest is just a bonus. A welcome bonus but optional. \n\nUnfortunately, I have a really hard time finding something like this.
