It's perfect for blog posts, presentations, decks, social posts, or just sparking your imagination.\n\n&gt;**Note:** It doesn\u2019t render images, **it gives you strong image prompts** tailored to your content so you can produce better visuals in fewer iterations.\n\n**How It Works (3 Quick Steps):**\n\n1. **Configure once**: Add your OpenAI key or enable Ollama in **Settings**.\n2. **Upload a document**: Doc2Image summarizes the content and generates image ideas.\n3. **Pick from the Idea Gallery**: Revisit all your generated ideas.\n\n# Key Features\n\n* **Upload \u2192 Summarize \u2192 Prompts**: A guided flow that understands your document and proposes visuals that actually fit.\n* **Bring Your Own Models**: Choose between **OpenAI** models or run fully local via **Ollama**.\n* **Idea Gallery**: Every session is saved\u2014skim, reuse, remix.\n* **Creativity Dials**: Control how conservative or adventurous the prompts should be.\n* **Intuitive Interface:** A clean, guided experience from start to finish.\n\n# Why Use Doc2Image?\n\nBecause it\u2019s **fast, focused, and cheap**.  \nDoc2Image is tuned to work great with **tiny/low-cost models** (think OpenAI nano models or deepseek-r1:1.5b via Ollama). You get sharp, on-topic image prompts without paying for heavyweight inference. Perfect for blogs, decks, reports, and social visuals.\n\nI\u2019d love feedback from this community!
