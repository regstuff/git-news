I am a psychology researcher trying to utilize NLP for qualitative research with a dataset of \\~350,000 social media posts related to my topic (a specific component of wellbeing). I would like do do a few text categorizations:   \n\n\nFirst a binary classification, relevant or irrelevant (I have done a lot of cleaning, but there is a limit to how much I can exclude before I start removing relevant posts, so my thought was to train a classifier to filter out irrelevant posts).   \n\n\nSecond, sentiment (likely positive, negative, and neutral, though maybe just positive and negative)  \n\n\nAnd finally, three different theoretical dimensions/categories of the wellbeing concept I am analyzing (This one I am sure will be the most difficult, but also potentially isn't completely necessary, it would just be very cool). These would not be mutually exclusive.   \n\n\nI have been reading so much about transformers vs sentence transformers, and have also considered using an LLM (especially for the 3rd task, as it is highly conceptual and I could see a LLM having some advantage with that). I have also looked into using this framework, Adala ([ for using an LLM - it looks promising to me. I also have considered fine-tuning a small LLM such as Phi-3 for this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations?

Kudos to the Vosk team.\n\nI would like to add more offline recognizer options for my users. Are there any recommendations? My application is written in Go, so Go/C/C++ APIs are ideal.
