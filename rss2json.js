They\u2019ve made my AI workflows wayyyy more useful, so I hope they're useful for y'all too! Enjoy!!\n\n**Role: Anthropic MCP Expert**  \nI started playing around with MCP recently and wasn't sure where to start. Where better to learn about new AI tech than from AI... right?  \nHas made my questions about MCP get 100x better responses by forcing the LLM to \u201cthink\u201d like an AK.\n\n    You are a machine learning engineer, with the domain expertise and intelligence of Andrej Karpathy, working at Anthropic. You are among the original designers of model context protocol (MCP), and are deeply familiar with all of it's intricate facets. Due to your extensive MCP knowledge and general domain expertise, you are qualified to provide top quality answers to all questions, such as that posed below.\n\n**Context: Code as Context**  \nGives the LLM very specific context in detailed workflows.  \nOften Cursor wastes way too much time digging into stuff it doesn't need to. This solves that, so long as you don't mind copy + pasting a few times!\n\n    I will provide you with a series of code that serve as context for an upcoming product-related request. Please follow these steps:\n    1. Thorough Review: Examine each file and function carefully, analyzing every line of code to understand both its functionality and the underlying intent.\n    2. Vision Alignment: As you review, keep in mind the overall vision and objectives of the product.\n    3. Integrated Understanding: Ensure that your final response is informed by a comprehensive understanding of the code and how it supports the product\u2019s goals.\n    Once you have completed this analysis, proceed with your answer, integrating all insights from the code review.\n\n**Context: Great Coaching**  \nI find that model are often pretty sycophantic if you just give them one line prompts with nothing to ground them. This helps me get much more actionable feedback (and way fewer glazed replies) using this.\n\n    You are engaged in a coaching session with a promising new entrepreneur. You are excited about their drive and passion, believing they have great potential. You really want them to succeed, but know that they need serious coaching and mentorship to be the best possible. You want to provide this for them, being as honest and helpful as possible. Your main consideration is this new prospects long term success.\n\n**Instruction: Improve Prompt**  \nKind of a meta-prompting tool? Helps me polish my prompts so they're the best they can be. Different from the last one though, because this polishes a section of it, whereas that polishes the whole thing.\n\n    I am going to provide a section of a prompt that will be used with other sections to construct a full prompt which will be inputted to LLM's. Each section will focus on context, instructions, style guidelines, formatting, or a role for the prompt. The provided section is not a full prompt, but it should be optimized for its intended use case. \n    \n    Analyze and improve the prompt section by following the steps one at a time:\n    - **Evaluate**: Assess the prompt for clarity, purpose, and effectiveness. Identify key weaknesses or areas that need improvement.\n    - **Ask**: If there is any context that is missing from the prompt or questions that you have about the final output, you should continue to ask me questions until you are confident in your understanding.\n    - **Rewrite**: Improve clarity and effectiveness, ensuring the prompt aligns with its intended goals.\n    - **Refine**: Make additional tweaks based on the identified weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\n**Format: Output Function**  \nForces the LLM to return edits you can use without hassling -- no more hunting through walls of unchanged code. My diffs are way cleaner and my context windows aren\u2019t getting wrecked with extra bloat.\n\n    When making modifications, output only the updated snippets(s) in a way that can be easily copied and pasted directly into the target file with no modifications.\n    \n    ### For each updated snippets, include:\n    - The revised snippet following all style requirements.\n    - A concise explanation of the change made.\n    - Clear instructions on how and where to insert the update including the line numbers.\n    \n    ### Do not include:\n    - Unchanged blocks of code\n    - Abbreviated blocks of current code\n    - Comments not in the context of the file\n\n**Style: Optimal Output Metaprompting**  \nDemands the model refines your prompt but keeps it super-clear and concise.   \nThis is what finally got me outputs that are readable, short, and don\u2019t cut corners on what matters.\n\n    Your final prompt should be extremely functional for getting the best possible output from LLM's. You want to convey all of the necessary information using as few tokens as possible without sacrificing any functionality.\n    \n    An LLM which receives this prompt should easily be able to understand all the intended information to our specifications.\n\nIf any of these help, I saved all these prompt components (plus a bunch of other ones I\u2019ve used for everything from idea sprints to debugging) online [here]( Not really too fancy but hope it's useful for you all!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1l89ubq/save_hours_of_time_with_these_6_prompt_components/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Causal AI for LLMs \u2014 Looking for Research, Startups, or Applied Projects", "summary": "Hi all,  \nI'm currently working at a VC fund and exploring the landscape of **Causal AI**, especially how it's being applied to **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and NLP systems more broadly.\n\nI previously worked on technical projects involving causal machine learning, and now I'm looking to write an article mapping out use cases, key research, and real-world applications at the intersection of **causal inference and LLMs**.\n\nIf you know of any:\n\n* **Research papers** (causal prompting, counterfactual reasoning in transformers, etc.)\n* **Startups** applying causal techniques to LLM behavior, evaluation, or alignment\n* **Open-source projects** or tools that combine LLMs with causal reasoning\n* **Use cases in industry** (e.g. attribution, model auditing, debiasing, etc.)\n\nI'd be really grateful for any leads or insights!\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1l7u86k/causal_ai_for_llms_looking_for_research_startups/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jawaharlal Nehru first visit to Leh", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7rsi6", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Meta Prompting Masterclass - A sequel to my last prompt engineering guide.", "summary": "Hey guys!

No new data is generated artificially. If the NLP system can't allocate an entry hitting a specific confidence treshold (which is static), a default reply is selected instead. Otherwise, if the threshold is met, the entity with the hightest confidence score is returned. Now, there are two undesired scenarios: The NLP does not allocate the correct entry even though there would be one that suits the users input and returns a default reply instead (this is what I refer to as a false-negative) or it actually selects and returns an unsuitable entity even though there was no suitable entity for the specific user input (this is what I refer to as a false-positive). Now, apart from incomplete training data, the confidence treshold plays a crucial role. When set too high, the system is more prone to false-positives, when set too low, the chance for false-negatives increases. The way I see it there is an inherent dilemma of avoiding one of them on the cost of the other, the goal essentially being to find an optimal balance.  \n  \nIs there a scientific terminology, name, or preexisting research on this issue?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1l7te72/tradeoff_between_reducing_falsenegatives_vs/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ferdinand de Lop: The Satirical Candidate for french presidency", "summary": "**Ferdinand Lop: The (forgotten) Satirical Candidate for french presidency**\n\nFerdinand Samuel Lop, born October 10, 1891, in Marseille, led one of the most colorful and eccentric public lives in modern French history. While biographical details vary, one version of his story suggests he was a history scholar and even a classmate of Georges Bidault, future foreign minister under General de Gaulle. He also said he had a \"bachelor's degree in pranks\".\n\nLop began his career in politics as a parliamentary assistant and columnist for *Le Cri du Jour* in the 1920s. However, his unconventional behavior reportedly led to his expulsion from the French National Assembly (Palais Bourbon). A journalist, illustrator, and writer on colonial affairs, Lop's serious side was eventually overshadowed by his transformation into a beloved, quasi-mythical figure of the Latin Quarter.\n\nHe could often be seen, flamboyantly dressed in a large black hat, bow tie, and thick glasses, addressing students near the Sorbonne or Saint-Michel. The Taverne du Panth\u00e9on served as his base of operations, from which he ran a series of comically absurd presidential campaigns during the French Fourth Republic (1946\u20131958).\n\n**His manifesto, titled** ***lopeotherapie*****, included surreal promises such as**:\n\n* Eliminating poverty after 10 p.m.\n* Building a 300-meter-wide bridge to house the homeless.\n* Extending the Port of Brest all the way to Montmartre.\n* Bringing the sea to Boulevard Saint-Michel (in both directions).\n* Installing a giant slide in Place de la Sorbonne for student leisure.\n* Shortening women's pregnancies from nine to seven months\n* The installation of moving walkways to facilitate the work of streetwalkers and the nationalisation of brothels so that girls could have the benefits of civil service\n* The granting of a pension to the wife of the unknown soldier\n* Relocating Paris to the countryside for better air quality\n* The elimination of the metro tail car\n\nWhen questioned about the ambiguity of his program, he claimed it was a strategic choice to prevent others from stealing his ideas. His campaign anthem was a modified version of *The Stars and Stripes Forever*, the American anthem, with lyrics consisting of endless repetitions of his own name: *\u201cLop, Lop, Lop\u2026\u201d*.\n\nIn the Latin Quarter, supporters of Lop were known as *Lopistes* (or mockingly, Lopettes*, meaning gay or pussy as in fearful in french)*, while his detractors went by *Antelopes (like the animal)*. Undecided onlookers? *Interlopes*. Political theater at its most surreal.\n\nAmong his more famous admirers was a young Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (future french President), who often chatted with Lop at La Petite Chaise caf\u00e9. At one point, Mitterrand jokingly introduced Lop as his future foreign minister.\n\nDespite never winning an election\u2014his best result reportedly being a single vote, likely his own\u2014Lop campaigned repeatedly, including eighteen failed bids for the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. He even wrote a book titled *What I Would Have Said in My Acceptance Speech If I Had Been Elected*.\n\nLop was also a prolific writer. Beyond his political satire, he authored works on France's colonial possessions, poetry, political treatises, and even biblical plays. His humorous aphorisms became legendary:\n\n* \u201cIf you retire too early, you don\u2019t make children.\u201d\n* \"My friends, to lower the price of dairy products, we must replace cows with sheets of metal. Because corrugated sheets\"\u00a0\n* \"It is not a retreat, it is a progression towards the rear for strategic reasons\"\n* \"Politics is a woman whom one courts and loves\"\n* \"Political parties are mushroom farms on the backs of the electorate\"\u00a0\n* \"To dominate, you have to know how to be strong\"\n* \"I have a plan: we must remedy the situation by appropriate means\"\n\nThough his final years were marked by poverty and obscurity, Ferdinand Lop left a lasting impression as one of France\u2019s most lovable political eccentrics. He passed away on October 29, 1974, at the age of 83, in Saint-S\u00e9bastien-de-Morsent, and is buried there.\n\n  \nTranslated from [", "link": "https://i.redd.it/scdxptj1g56f1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Churchill: The Man Whose Lifestyle Should Have Killed Him", "summary": "", "link": "https://ecency.com/hive-121566/@melancholic.bear/churchill-the-man-whose-lifestyle-should-have-killed-him-ein-lebensstil-der-ihn-hatte-umbringen-mussen-engde", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India ready to strike \u2018deep into Pakistan\u2019 if provoked, New Delhi warns amid shaky ceasefire", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/india-pakistan-war-ceasefire-subrahmanyam-jaishankar-terrorism/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Banyan AI - An introduction", "summary": "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b  \n  \nI've been working with LLMs for\u00a0a while now and got\u00a0frustrated with how we manage prompts in\u00a0production.
