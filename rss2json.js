My current approach to sample a hard negative for each question picks the segment (amongst the 40,000) that fulfills the following criteria:\n\n(1) The cosine similarity between the negative and the anchor should be higher than the cosine similarity between the anchor and positive.\n\n(2) The cosine similarity between the negative and the anchor should be higher than the cosine similarity between the positive and negative\n\n(3) The topic vector (a bespoke vector of size 2 containing 1 main and 1 second-level topic) between both anchor and negative should match on index 0 but differ on index 1 (i.e., overall topic the same, but specificity is different)\n\nThis creates a dataset of roughly 1,000 hard negatives which aren't bad but oftentimes too close to the positive. Therefore I'd like to know whether there are any other considerations that I could take into account to create an improved dataset. \n\nAny ideas are welcome!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nk64ml/techniques_for_automatic_hard_negatives_dataset/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Analysis: India\u2019s power-sector CO2 falls for only second time in half a century", "summary": "India\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its power sector fell by 1% year-on-year in the first half of 2025 and by 0.2% over the past 12 months, only the second drop in almost half a century.\n\nAs a result, India\u2019s CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement grew at their slowest rate in the first half of the year since 2001\u00a0\u2013 excluding Covid\u00a0\u2013 according to new analysis for Carbon Brief.\n\nThe analysis is the first of a regular new series covering India\u2019s CO2 emissions, based on monthly data for fuel use, industrial production and power output, compiled from numerous official sources.", "link": "https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-indias-power-sector-co2-falls-for-only-second-time-in-half-a-century/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How do you use Perplexica or SearXng as an MCP tool in OWUI", "summary": "I heard this mentioned before but not sure how this would work.
