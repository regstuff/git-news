What used to work smoothly now requires constant babysitting.

OpenAI clearly knows about these changes. They\u2019re not accidental. They\u2019re just counting on the fact that without official specifications or metrics, nobody can prove anything.\n\nThis needs to stop.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing the same issues, make some noise.

We shouldn\u2019t have to waste our time documenting their downgrades while paying premium prices for degraded service.\n\nOpenAI: if you need to reduce capabilities, fine.

In Germany they way you document is different by State in North Rhine Westphalia where I work, we use the so called:\" Rheinische Stellen Kartensystem\" that you can Translation to something like rhenish place card System. Which basically are Paper Cards with every Info.\nWe normally use: arbitrary level excavation. And every Thing gets a number, so:\n1. The Dig gets a number consisting of the Overall administrative Area we dig in e.g. Overrath=OV. The year e.g. 2019 and the number of Digital we are in this year e.g. 319. So the Number looks like this: OV 2019/319.\n2. Every trench or working or when and whatever ever you determenine needs a number gets one. You Start with one ging upwards so the Numbers could Look like this\nOV 2019/319\n3: Work Area(AB)/first Trench\n4: Humus in Work Area 3\n5:Layer of Earth with burnt elements in Work Area 3\n6: Layer of a Clayfloor in Work Area 3 etc.\n\n3. In your subnumbers you write down every Step you take so.\n\nOV 2019/319, \n3.1. Definition as Work Area\n3.2. Laying? Of the first arbitrary level(Planum 1)\n3.4. Picture of the Work Area including [4],[7]&amp;[8]\n3.5. Description of the work area \n3.6. Scetch of the work area including [4],[7]&amp;[8]\n3.7. Finds from the work area ceramics\n3.8. Finds from the work area bones\nEtc.\n\nIf you mention a Number subnumber you have to make a reference on the card for this number.\n\nE.g. \nOV 2019/319\n7.9. Picture taken see [3]-4\n\nSo yeah thats how we document our working stets. A example Picture is up there.
