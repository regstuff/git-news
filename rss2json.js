But deforestation rates in 2024 were 63% higher than the trajectory needed to meet this 2030 target\n\n&gt;More than half of the world\u2019s forested area is located in just five countries: Russia, Brazil, Canada, the US and China.\n\n&gt;There are many driving factors behind continuing deforestation. Agriculture has historically been the leading cause of forest loss, but wildfire is increasingly posing a threat. Wildfires were the leading driver of tropical forest loss in 2024 for the first time on record, a Global Forest Watch report found earlier this year.\n\n&gt;A different report from an international team of scientists recently found that fires burned at least 370Mha of land \u2013 an area larger than India \u2013 between March 2024 and February 2025.\n\n&gt;The chart above shows that some nations, such as China and Russia, added a lot more forest cover than they removed in the past decade through, for example, afforestation programmes.\u00a0\n\n&gt;But in other countries \u2013 particularly Brazil \u2013 the level of deforestation far surpasses the amount of forest re-grown.\n\n&gt;Levels of net forest gain in Canada also fell from 513,000ha per year in 2000-15 to 82,500ha per year in 2015-25.\u00a0\n\n&gt;In the US, the net forest growth trend reversed over the past decade \u2013 from 437,000ha per year of gain in 2000-15 to a net forest loss of 120,000ha per year from 2015 to 2025.\u00a0\n\n&gt;Oceania reversed a previously negative trend to gain 140,000ha of forests per year in the past decade, the report says. This was mainly due to changes in Australia, where previous losses of tens of thousands of hectares each year turned into an annual net gain of 105,000ha each year by 2015-25.\n\n&gt;The report notes that the total amount of carbon stored in forests has remained largely static over the past 35 years, but with some regional differences, as highlighted in the chart above.\u00a0\n\n&gt;The amount of carbon stored in forests across east Asia, Europe and North America is \u201csignificantly higher\u201d now due to expanded forest areas, but it is lower in South America, Africa and Central America.\n\n&gt;Several studies have shown that there are limitations on the ability of forests to keep absorbing CO2, with difficulties posed by hotter, drier weather fuelled by climate change.\n\n&gt;The amount of forested land located in protected areas increased across all regions between 1990 and 2025.\n\n&gt;Around 20% of the world\u2019s forests are located in these protected areas, the new report finds, which amounts to 813Mha of land \u2013 an area almost the size of Brazil.\u00a0\n\n&gt;Nearly every country in the world has pledged to protect 30% of the Earth\u2019s land and sea by 2030. However, more than half of countries have not committed to this target on a national basis\n\n&gt;Almost 18% of land and around 8% of the ocean are currently in protected areas, a UN report found last year. The level is increasing, the report said, but considerable progress is still needed to reach the 2030 goal.\n\n&gt;As highlighted in the chart above, 26% of all forests in Asia are protected, which is the highest of any region.

A deputy foreign minister notes that the train line in question is used for supplying Ukraine.\n\nReports of damage on the track first emerged on Sunday, after a train driver noticed damaged rails near the village of Mika on the route between Warsaw and Lublin. On Sunday afternoon, Tusk said the incident may have been an act of sabotage.\n\nOn Monday morning, the prime minister announced that, \u201cunfortunately, the worst fears have been confirmed\u201d. He said an \u201cexplosive charge\u201d had been used to destroy the track and noted that damage on the same line had been discovered at another location closer to Lublin.\n\nThe emergency services, Internal Security Agency (ABW) and prosecutor\u2019s office are working to investigate the incidents, which did not result in any injuries. Rail traffic continues to operate on an adjacent track.\n\nPoland has in recent years experienced a number of acts of sabotage, many of which have been blamed on individuals and groups operating on behalf of Russia.\n\nIn 2023, 16 members of a group operating on behalf of Russia were\u00a0[jailed]( They had\u00a0[planned]( among other objectives, to blow up aid trains bound for Ukraine. Since then, a number of other acts of sabotage, including\u00a0[arson attacks]( have been carried out by other groups.\n\nHowever, speaking to broadcaster Polsat on Sunday, deputy interior minister Maciej Duszczyk appealed for people not to automatically blame Russia for every such incident.\n\n\u201cRussia isn\u2019t so powerful that every arson, every situation of this kind, is provoked by Russia,\u201d said Duszczyk, though he added that Russia\u2019s involvement in the latest incident \u201ccannot be ruled out\u201d.\n\nHowever, Duszczyk\u2019s former boss, Bart\u0142omiej Sienkiewicz, who served as interior minister from 2023 to 2024, did immediately suggest that Russia was behind the incident, telling broadcaster TVN that \u201cit may indicate a new form of hybrid warfare between Russia and Poland\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot a month goes by without some form of aggression from people recruited by the Russian security services on the territory of not only Poland but the entire European Union,\u201d added Sienkiewicz, who is now an MEP for Tusk\u2019s Civic Coalition (KO) party. \u201cWe are truly at war.\u201d\n\nDeputy foreign minister Marcin Bosacki similarly told broadcaster TVP that \u201cnot a week goes by without our services detecting acts of sabotage by Russia\u201d. He noted that the latest incident took place on a track that is part of \u201ca very important route\u2026for supplying Ukraine\u201d.\n\nLater on Monday, the chief of staff of the Polish armed forces, Wies\u0142aw Kuku\u0142a, issued a statement on the incident. While he did not name Russia directly, he appeared to suggest Moscow was behind it.\n\n\u201cThe adversary has begun preparations for war,\u201d said General Kuku\u0142a. \u201cThey are building a certain environment here that is intended to undermine public trust in the government and institutions such as the armed forces and police.

Among those to\u00a0[attend this year\u2019s event](\u00a0was right-wing President Karol Nawrocki.\n\nHowever, in its news coverage of the event, NRK featured an on-screen label saying \u201cNazi marches in Poland\u201d.\n\nThe use of such a term is particularly sensitive for Poles given that their country suffered perhaps more than any other under\u00a0[Nazi-German occupation in World War Two](\n\nAround 6 million Polish citizens, 17% of the prewar\u00a0population, were killed in the war, a higher proportion than in any other country.\u00a0Poland also never had a collaborationist government, unlike many other European countries, including Norway.\n\nNRK\u2019s description of the march prompted anger in Poland. Ryszard Czarnecki, a politician from the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, Poland\u2019s main opposition, called it \u201canti-Polish propaganda\u201d. He said he felt personally offended as he had attended the march with his teenage son.\n\nMoja Norwegia, a news service aimed at Norway\u2019s large Polish immigrant population, reports that there was outrage among the Polish community and that Polish organisations had been issuing complaints to NRK, the Norwegian Media Ethics Commission, and the country\u2019s Broadcasting Council.\n\nThe Polish embassy in Oslo also contacted NRK, asking it to issue a correction. On Friday, in a statement issued to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), the head of news at NRK, Ole Eivind Henden, apologised on behalf of the station.\n\n\u201cThe term used is not NRK\u2019s \u200b\u200bassessment of what this march was,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBoth our nations were under Nazi occupation. It is easy to understand the feelings such a term evokes. The term \u2018Nazi marches\u2019 was unjustified and NRK apologises for using it.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who was then leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group in the European Parliament, caused similar controversy by describing the Independence March as \u201c60,000 fascists marching in the streets of Warsaw \u2013 neo-Nazis, white supremacists\u201d.\n\nThat prompted criticism from Poland\u2019s then-President Andrzej Duda, who called the remarks \u201cabsolutely scandelous\u201d. Kosma Z\u0142otowski, a PiS MEP, said the comments were \u201cextremely offensive\u201d and called on Verhofstadt to apologise.\n\nA Polish nationalist activist launched legal action against Verhofstadt, accusing him of defamation and insult. In 2019, a Warsaw court requested that the European Parliament strip Verhofstadt\u2019s immunity to face the claim.\n\nHowever, in 2020, an overwhelming majority of MEPs, 696, voted against waiving his immunity, with only 59 in favour, PiS MEPs among them.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/15/norwegian-state-tv-apologises-for-calling-polish-independence-march-nazi/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK minister unveils plan to cut animal testing through greater use of AI", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/11/uk-plan-to-cut-animal-testing-artificial-intelligence-ai-3d-bioprinting", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
