You can use it directly in JSON. Here is an example JSON document.  \ndoc = {  \n\"_id\": ObjectId(\"64b8ff58c5d61b60eab4a8cd\"), #BSON data type  \n\"user_name\": \"satoshi\",  \n\"bio\": EmbText(\"Satoshi is a passionate software developer with a decade of experience specializing in...\") # EmbJSON data type  \n}\n\n# When you use collection.qeury(\"who is Satoshi\") later -&gt; you'll get a relevant chunks!\n\nI also included ObjectId()to highlight the similarities between EmbJSON syntax and BSON syntax. The point is that you can simply wrap any text value in your JSON document and it's automatically chunked, embedded, and indexed. \n\nI guess seeing a sample use case might help to understand this better.
