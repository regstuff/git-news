You can use them separately until your prompt is perfect. \n\nThis prompt is different because of how flexible it is, the evaluation prompt evaluates across 35 criteria, everything from clarity, logic, tone, hallucination risks and many more. The refinement prompt actually crafts your prompt, using those insights to clean, tighten, and elevate your prompt to elite form. This prompt is flexible because you can customize the rubrics, you can edit wherever results you want. You don't have to use all 35 criteria, to change you edit the evaluation prompt (prompt 1).\n\n# How To Use It (Step-by-step)\n\n1. Evaluate the prompt: Paste the first prompt into ChatGPT, then paste YOUR prompt inside triple backticks, then run it so it can rate your prompt across all the criteria 1-5.\n   \n2.

As AI models become increasingly powerful, the gap between novice and expert prompt engineers continues to widen. Here are the ten fundamental pillars that define true mastery in this rapidly evolving field.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **1. Mastering the Art of Contextual Layering**\n\n\u2756 *The Foundation of Advanced Prompting*\n\nContextual layering is the practice of building complex, multi-dimensional context through iterative additions of information. Think of it as constructing a knowledge architecture where each layer adds depth and specificity to your intended outcome.\n\nEffective layering involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Progressive context building**: Starting with core objectives and gradually adding supporting information\n\n\u25c7 **Strategic integration**: Carefully connecting external sources (transcripts, studies, documents) to your current context\n\n\u25c7 **Purposeful accumulation**: Each layer serves the ultimate goal, building toward a specific endpoint\n\nThe key insight is that how you introduce and connect these layers matters enormously. A YouTube transcript becomes exponentially more valuable when you explicitly frame its relevance to your current objective rather than simply dumping the content into your prompt.\n\n**Example Application**: Instead of immediately asking for a complex marketing strategy, layer in market research, competitor analysis, target audience insights, and brand guidelines across multiple iterations, building toward that final strategic request.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **2. Assumption Management and Model Psychology**\n\n\u2756 *Understanding the Unspoken Communication*\n\nEvery prompt carries implicit assumptions, and skilled prompt engineers develop an intuitive understanding of how models interpret unstated context. This psychological dimension of prompting requires both technical knowledge and empathetic communication skills.\n\nMaster-level assumption management includes:\n\n\u25c7 **Predictive modeling**: Anticipating what the AI will infer from your wording\n\n\u25c7 **Assumption validation**: Testing your predictions through iterative refinement\n\n\u25c7 **Token optimization**: Using fewer tokens when you're confident about model assumptions\n\n\u25c7 **Risk assessment**: Balancing efficiency against the possibility of misinterpretation\n\nThis skill develops through extensive interaction with models, building a mental database of how different phrasings and structures influence AI responses. It's part art, part science, and requires constant calibration.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **3. Perfect Timing and Request Architecture**\n\n\u2756 *Knowing When to Ask for What You Really Need*\n\nExpert prompt engineers develop an almost musical sense of timing\u2014knowing exactly when the context has been sufficiently built to make their key request. This involves maintaining awareness of your ultimate objective while deliberately building toward a threshold where you're confident of achieving the caliber of output you're aiming for.\n\nKey elements include:\n\n\u25c7 **Objective clarity**: Always knowing your end goal, even while building context\n\n\u25c7 **Contextual readiness**: Recognizing when sufficient foundation has been laid\n\n\u25c7 **Request specificity**: Crafting precise asks that leverage all the built-up context\n\n\u25c7 **System thinking**: Designing prompts that work within larger workflows\n\nThis connects directly to layering\u2014you're not just adding context randomly, but building deliberately toward moments of maximum leverage.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **4. The 50-50 Principle: Subject Matter Expertise**\n\n\u2756 *Your Knowledge Determines Your Prompt Quality*\n\nPerhaps the most humbling aspect of advanced prompting is recognizing that your own expertise fundamentally limits the quality of outputs you can achieve. The \"50-50 principle\" acknowledges that roughly half of prompting success comes from your domain knowledge.\n\nThis principle encompasses:\n\n\u25c7 **Collaborative learning**: Using AI as a learning partner to rapidly acquire necessary knowledge\n\n\u25c7 **Quality recognition**: Developing the expertise to evaluate AI outputs meaningfully\n\n\u25c7 **Iterative improvement**: Your growing knowledge enables better prompts, which generate better outputs\n\n\u25c7 **Honest assessment**: Acknowledging knowledge gaps and addressing them systematically\n\nThe most effective prompt engineers are voracious learners who use AI to accelerate their acquisition of domain expertise across multiple fields.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **5. Systems Architecture and Prompt Orchestration**\n\n\u2756 *Building Interconnected Prompt Ecosystems*\n\nSystems are where prompt engineering gets serious. You're not just working with individual prompts anymore\u2014you're building frameworks where prompts interact with each other, where outputs from one become inputs for another, where you're guiding entire workflows through series of connected interactions. This is about seeing the bigger picture of how everything connects together.\n\nSystem design involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Workflow mapping**: Understanding how different prompts connect and influence each other\n\n\u25c7 **Output chaining**: Designing prompts that process outputs from other prompts\n\n\u25c7 **Agent communication**: Creating frameworks for AI agents to interact effectively\n\n\u25c7 **Scalable automation**: Building systems that can handle varying inputs and contexts\n\nMastering systems requires deep understanding of all other principles\u2014assumption management becomes critical when one prompt's output feeds into another, and timing becomes essential when orchestrating multi-step processes.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **6. Combating the Competence Illusion**\n\n\u2756 *Staying Humble in the Face of Powerful Tools*\n\nOne of the greatest dangers in prompt engineering is the ease with which powerful tools can create an illusion of expertise. AI models are so capable that they make everyone feel like an expert, leading to overconfidence and stagnated learning.\n\nMaintaining appropriate humility involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Continuous self-assessment**: Regularly questioning your actual skill level\n\n\u25c7 **Failure analysis**: Learning from mistakes and misconceptions\n\n\u25c7 **Peer comparison**: Seeking feedback from other skilled practitioners\n\n\u25c7 **Growth mindset**: Remaining open to fundamental changes in your approach\n\nThe most dangerous prompt engineers are those who believe they've \"figured it out.\" The field evolves too rapidly for anyone to rest on their expertise.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **7. Hallucination Detection and Model Skepticism**\n\n\u2756 *Developing Intuition for AI Deception*\n\nAs AI outputs become more sophisticated, the ability to detect inaccuracies, hallucinations, and logical inconsistencies becomes increasingly valuable. This requires both technical skills and domain expertise.\n\nEffective detection strategies include:\n\n\u25c7 **Structured verification**: Building verification steps into your prompting process\n\n\u25c7 **Domain expertise**: Having sufficient knowledge to spot errors immediately\n\n\u25c7 **Consistency checking**: Looking for internal contradictions in responses\n\n\u25c7 **Source validation**: Always maintaining healthy skepticism about AI claims\n\nThe goal isn't to distrust AI entirely, but to develop the judgment to know when and how to verify important outputs.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **8. Model Capability Mapping and Limitation Awareness**\n\n\u2756 *Understanding What AI Can and Cannot Do*\n\nThe debate around AI capabilities is often unproductive because it focuses on theoretical limitations rather than practical effectiveness. The key question becomes: does the system accomplish what you need it to accomplish?\n\nPractical capability assessment involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Empirical testing**: Determining what works through experimentation rather than theory\n\n\u25c7 **Results-oriented thinking**: Prioritizing functional success over technical purity\n\n\u25c7 **Adaptive expectations**: Adjusting your approach based on what actually works\n\n\u25c7 **Creative problem-solving**: Finding ways to achieve goals even when models have limitations\n\nThe key insight is that sometimes things work in practice even when they \"shouldn't\" work in theory, and vice versa.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **9. Balancing Dialogue and Prompt Perfection**\n\n\u2756 *Understanding Two Complementary Approaches*\n\nBoth iterative dialogue and carefully crafted \"perfect\" prompts are essential, and they work together as part of one integrated approach. The key is understanding that they serve different functions and excel in different contexts.\n\nThe dialogue game involves:\n\n\u25c7 **Context building through interaction**: Each conversation turn can add layers of context\n\n\u25c7 **Prompt development**: Building up context that eventually becomes snapshot prompts\n\n\u25c7 **Long-term context maintenance**: Maintaining ongoing conversations and using tools to preserve valuable context states\n\n\u25c7 **System setup**: Using dialogue to establish and refine the frameworks you'll later systematize\n\nThe perfect prompt game focuses on:\n\n\u25c7 **Professional reliability**: Creating consistent, repeatable outputs for production environments\n\n\u25c7 **System automation**: Building prompts that work independently without dialogue\n\n\u25c7 **Agent communication**: Crafting instructions that other systems can process reliably\n\n\u25c7 **Efficiency at scale**: Avoiding the time cost of dialogue when you need predictable results\n\nThe reality is that prompts often emerge as snapshots of dialogue context. You build up understanding and context through conversation, then capture that accumulated wisdom in standalone prompts. Both approaches are part of the same workflow, not competing alternatives.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25c8 **10. Adaptive Mastery and Continuous Evolution**\n\n\u2756 *Thriving in a Rapidly Changing Landscape*\n\nThe AI field evolves at unprecedented speed, making adaptability and continuous learning essential for maintaining expertise. This requires both technical skills and psychological resilience.\n\nAdaptive mastery encompasses:\n\n\u25c7 **Rapid model adoption**: Quickly understanding and leveraging new AI capabilities\n\n\u25c7 **Framework flexibility**: Updating your mental models as the field evolves\n\n\u25c7 **Learning acceleration**: Using AI itself to stay current with developments\n\n\u25c7 **Community engagement**: Participating in the broader prompt engineering community\n\n\u25c7 **Mental organization**: Maintaining focus and efficiency despite constant change\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n**The Integration Challenge**\n\nThese ten pillars don't exist in isolation\u2014mastery comes from integrating them into a cohesive approach that feels natural and intuitive. The most skilled prompt engineers develop almost musical timing, seamlessly blending technical precision with creative intuition.\n\nThe field demands patience for iteration, tolerance for ambiguity, and the intellectual honesty to acknowledge when you don't know something. Most importantly, it requires recognizing that in a field evolving this rapidly, yesterday's expertise becomes tomorrow's baseline.\n\nAs AI capabilities continue expanding, these foundational principles provide a stable framework for growth and adaptation. Master them, and you'll be equipped not just for today's challenges, but for the inevitable transformations ahead.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n*The journey from casual AI user to expert prompt engineer is one of continuous discovery, requiring both technical skill and fundamental shifts in how you think about communication, learning, and problem-solving. These ten pillars provide the foundation for that transformation.*\n\n**A Personal Note**\n\nThis post reflects my own experience and thinking about prompt engineering\u2014my thought process, my observations, my approach to this field. I'm not presenting this as absolute truth or claiming this is definitively how things should be done. These are simply my thoughts and perspectives based on my journey so far.\n\nThe field is evolving so rapidly that what works today might change tomorrow. What makes sense to me might not resonate with your experience or approach. Take what's useful, question what doesn't fit, and develop your own understanding.

I already learned it the hard way, while shipping my projects, tweaking prompts like a lunatic, and arguing with AI like it\u2019s my cofounder)))\n\nHere\u2019s their advice:\n\n**Before You Touch Code:**\n\n1. Make a plan with AI before coding. Like, a real one. With thoughts.\n2. Save it as a markdown doc. This becomes your dev bible.\n3. Label stuff you\u2019re avoiding as *\u201cnot today, Satan\u201d* and throw wild ideas in a \u201clater\u201d bucket.\n\n**Pick Your Poison (Tools):**\n\n1. If you\u2019re new, try Replit or anything friendly-looking.\n2. If you like pain, go full Cursor or Windsurf.\n3. Want chaos? Use both and let them fight it out.\n\n**Git or Regret:**\n\n1. Commit every time something works. No exceptions.\n2. Don\u2019t trust the \u201cundo\u201d button. It lies.\n3. If your AI spirals into madness, nuke the repo and reset.\n\n**Testing, but Make It Vibe:**\n\n1. Integration &gt; unit tests. Focus on what the user sees.\n2. Write your tests before moving on \u2014 no skipping.\n3. Tests = mental seatbelts. Especially when you\u2019re \u201crefactoring\u201d (a.k.a. breaking things).\n\n**Debugging With a Therapist:**\n\n1. Copy errors into GPT. Ask it what it *thinks* happened.\n2. Make the AI brainstorm causes *before* it touches code.\n3. Don\u2019t stack broken ideas. Reset instead.\n4. Add logs. More logs. Logs on logs.\n5. If one model keeps being dumb, try another. (They\u2019re not all equally trained.)\n\n**AI As Your Junior Dev:**\n\n1. Give it proper onboarding: long, detailed instructions.\n2. Store docs locally. Models suck at clicking links.\n3. Show screenshots. Point to what\u2019s broken like you\u2019re in a crime scene.\n4. Use voice input. Apparently, Aqua makes you prompt twice as fast. I remain skeptical.\n\n**Coding Architecture for Adults:**\n\n1. Small files. Modular stuff. Pretend your codebase will be read by actual humans.\n2. Use boring, proven frameworks. The AI knows them better.\n3. Prototype crazy features *outside* your codebase. Like a sandbox.\n4. Keep clear API boundaries \u2014 let parts of your app talk to each other like polite coworkers.\n5. Test scary things in isolation before adding them to your lovely, fragile project.\n\n**AI Can Also Be:**\n\n1. Your DevOps intern (DNS configs, hosting, etc).\n2. Your graphic designer (icons, images, favicons).\n3. Your teacher (ask it to explain its code back to you, like a student in trouble).\n\nAI isn\u2019t just a tool. It\u2019s a second pair of (slightly unhinged) hands.\n\n**You\u2019re the CEO now. Act like it**.\n\nSet context. Guide it. Reset when needed. And don\u2019t let it gaslight you with bad code.\n\n\\---\n\np.s. and I think it\u2019s fair to say \u2014 I\u2019m writing a newsletter where 2,500+ of us are figuring this out together, you can find it [here](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kt0x5y/ycombinator_just_dropped_a_vibe_coding_tutorial/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Exclusive: India may let US, foreign firms bid for government contracts, sources say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-may-let-us-foreign-firms-bid-government-contracts-sources-say-2025-05-23/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lahore Air Traffic Control refused IndiGo Delhi-Srinagar pilot's request to enter airspace &amp; avoid hailstorm", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lahore-atc-refused-indigo-delhi-srinagar-pilot-request-to-enter-airspace-avoid-turbulence-sources/articleshow/121345348.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The future host of The Apprentice, Donald Trump, evicted a bedridden 74 yr old Mary Filan out of her on Barclay Avenue in Flushing, Queens.", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/65w66newzg2f1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists confirm first 'hybrid child' showing human-Neanderthal interbreeding", "summary": "The debate surrounding how the Neanderthals were wiped out has raged since the archaic hominin species was discovered in Germany's Neander Vallery in 1856.  \n  \nSome believed that waves of technologically superior hunter-gatherers had spelled the doom of their heavy-foreheaded cousins, others argued for an epidemic of modern human diseases, while some even said that the Neanderthals vanished from the Earth after interbreeding with these early people - 40,000 years ago.  \n  \nBut then, in 2010, it was discovered that many ethnic groups outside of Africa can actually thank Neanderthals for around two per cent of their DNA, with their influence largely found in the genes affecting skin and hair. But with this revelation came a new question, where was the archaeological evidence for this implied interspecies breeding?  \n  \nHowever, a groundbreaking study appears to have just proved this long-discussed hypothesis, by dating the bones of a four-year-old human-Neanderthal \"hybrid child\" to 28,000 years ago. The ancient child's grave was first discovered in 1998 and made news around the world for its astounding mixture of features from both species, but a lack of accurate dating made conclusions hard to draw.  \n  \nArchaeologists struggled for decades to date the oddly shaped bones found in a rock shelter in Portugal, but a breakthrough in radiocarbon dating techniques finally allowed the research team to determine this misshapen child's place in human history.  \n  \n\"Being able to successfully date the child felt like giving them back a tiny piece of their story, which is a huge privilege,\" said the University of Miami's Bethan Linscott, who helped with the breakthrough finding.  \n  \nTouchingly,\u00a0despite more time elapsing between this child's birth and the advent of agriculture in 10,000BC than between this revolutionary period and today, their grave still betrays a very human emotion and family setting.  \n  \nThe researchers found that the red ochre colour found all over the bones was most likely from a cloak that had been wrapped around the young four-year-old by its family as they laid them to rest in the grave. Portraying the sentimentality and sorrow that the poor hybrid child's family had experienced at their death, 1200 generations of humanity ago.  \n  \nScientists were able to successfully date the bones for the first time by analysing traces of the amino acid hydroxyproline, which helps to form bone collagen. The team were able to isolate proteins in the acid that allowed them to accurately date the child to 28,000 years ago.  \n  \nTheir findings showed that, even in the Iberian Peninsula, where some anthropologists believe Neanderthals might have lived on until 35,000 years ago, some of their ancient hominin traits still persisted in some human communities many thousands of years after their last appearance in the fossil record.  \n  \nNamed after the valley they were discovered in, the Lapedo Child had a prominent Neanderthal jaw and build, but also had the chin and arms of a modern human. This means that the four-year-old likely had a larger proportion of Neanderthal genes in their DNA than modern humans, supporting the interbreeding theory for the collapse in Neanderthal populations.  \n  \nNeanderthals existed as a separate hominin species by around 400,000 years ago, roaming from western Europe to east Asia, but disappeared from the fossil record from around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago. This is just 20,000 years after modern humans (homo sapiens) made their world-dominating expansion out of Africa into these same areas.  \n  \nThese findings suggest that, rather than clubbing or spearing each other to death, humans and Neanderthals likely co-existed for millenia, possibly even in mixed groups sharing cultural burial practices. However, this exact relationship between us and the last-ever other hominin species remains unclear.  \n  \nCurrent genetic research suggests that all of the Neanderthal DNA present in our genetic code is from Neanderthal males breeding with human women, rather than human men mating with Neanderthal females. This is because researchers have yet to find any mitochondrial DNA belonging to this other species in our code, which can only be passed down from mother to child.  \n  \nSadly, as these ancient archaeologists and genetic researchers are grappling with what little information can be gleaned from these very rare fossil remains, the circumstances of this human-Neanderthal interbreeding will likely remain hidden in the mists of time.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ktdens/archaeologists_confirm_first_hybrid_child_showing/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Clox v1.1 Released : A CLI Based Clock/Calendar for Tech Enthusiasts.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/clox", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A 19-year-old won $100,000 for inventing a cheaper, faster way to make antiviral drugs out of corn husks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aol.com/19-old-won-100-000-220920320.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMDdIQfCITvNoxuMTLVfz6Ar5F_47U6WBG5FUrQzKMKPzzAfEfTMg9weAs4mFIRStJQkPmqqDaEwlykxobWE3Onf3X2RecctQIOBHxyK1u6nPn87Q_-2xuq09tLD7i7LYW9zOw2r6aTookzIEfa2rWpk_3mAWzlnlaSGSA6a5pzY", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan hires Trump-linked lobbyists to boost ties with US amid India tensions", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/pakistan-hires-trump-linked-lobbyists-to-boost-ties-with-us-amid-india-tensions/articleshow/121346479.cms?from=mdr", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indian study permits see 31% drop as Canada tightens international student cap", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indian-study-permits-drop-canada-10022800/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "TSMC declined India\u2019s invitation to set up plant: Report", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.economictimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/tsmc-declined-indias-invitation-to-set-up-plant-report/articleshow/121306183.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to create my own model and publish it", "summary": "I\u2019m excited to be here and working on a school project where I need to create my own or a trained model similar to the ones mentioned above.
