I\u2019d really appreciate insights from people who\u2019ve studied Islamic history, colonial/postcolonial religious shifts, or the cultural impact of modern state-sponsored ideologies.\n\nTo lay the context: Sufism has existed as a core part of Islamic spiritual life since at least the 8th-9th centuries. By the time of the so-called Islamic Golden Age (roughly 13th-17th centuries), it seems clear that Sufism played a significant role in shaping the cultural, artistic, and theological landscape of much of the Muslim world-from Persia to North Africa to South Asia. In fact, this period overlaps with what is sometimes called a religious renaissance in India, marked by the rise of both Bhakti and Sufi movements that emphasized divine love, personal devotion, music, poetry, and a rejection of rigid orthodoxy. The parallels between these movements are striking and seem to reflect a broader, more inclusive spiritual culture that thrived across regions.\n\nThis leads to some specific questions:\n\nIf Sufism was such an integral part of Islamic culture for so many centuries, when and why did Islamic orthodoxy begin viewing it as a threat? Were there clear political or theological triggers for this shift?\n\nHow did global Sufi movements differ from the uniquely syncretic, Bhakti-influenced Sufism that developed in India? Was Indian Sufism seen as particularly unorthodox from a transregional Islamic perspective?\n\nWhen exactly did Wahhabism and later Salafism (especially Saudi-backed forms) begin actively challenging or erasing these more syncretic and spiritually diverse forms of Islam?\n\n\nIt seems that by the late 20th century, Saudi Arabia-flush with oil wealth-began exporting a very narrow, rigid interpretation of Islam to countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh, influencing religious education, mosque infrastructure, media, and public life. This interpretation often marginalized or outright rejected the Sufi traditions that had been central to these regions for centuries.\n\nFast forward to the post-9/11 era, and there appears to be a major shift: Saudi Arabia begins a massive image overhaul, pushing a modernized, reformed version of itself-opening up to tourism, softening public religious controls, and promoting itself as a model for a contemporary, moderate Islam. Meanwhile, the countries that were deeply influenced by Saudi-style religious conservatism are left with the cultural disarray, radicalization issues, and spiritual suppression that accompanied decades of that ideological export.\n\nSo I\u2019m trying to understand this historically:\n\nIs it accurate to say that Saudi Arabia played a central role in eroding the cultural diversity of Islam in places like South Asia through its Wahhabi/Salafi influence?\n\nHow much of the current global perception of Islam-particularly around extremism-has roots in Saudi-funded religious movements, and why has this largely escaped mainstream accountability?\n\nTo what extent is Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201creformed\u201d image a result of it having externalized the ideological extremism it once promoted?\n\n\nAny historical or scholarly context on how these ideological and cultural shifts unfolded would be incredibly helpful-especially if there\u2019s work tracing the spiritual and political consequences of this transition across the Muslim world.\n\nDo correct me if I'm wrong, global Islamic history isn't exactly my forte.
