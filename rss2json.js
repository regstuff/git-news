He has published an article essentially arguing that geopolitical interventions by Western nations have created refugee crises, yet those same nations implement policies to keep out the displaced populations their actions helped create. Think about it US ruined Afghanistan but refugees are borne by India.  His central argument is that mainstream refugee law scholarship ignores connections between imperialism and displacement.\n\nHe points out that many recent major refugee flows occurred because of Western interventions in the Global South, specifically mentioning Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Yet refugees fleeing these nations are not welcome in the Global North countries whose policies contributed to instability in their home regions.\n\nThe article traces how the 1951 Refugee Convention functioned differently depending on geopolitical circumstances. During the Cold War, Western nations used it liberally to accept refugees from communist countries because this served their strategic interests. People fleeing Eastern Europe or Cuba were welcomed as proof that the opposing system was failing.\n\nAfter the Cold War ended, the primary direction of refugee movement shifted from South to North. At that point the same convention that had been interpreted generously became the basis for what scholars term the \"non entree regime,\" essentially a system of barriers to keep people out. This entire transformation happened without any formal amendment to the treaty text.\n\nChimni argues that understanding these patterns requires examining what he calls the \"logic of capital\" alongside the \"logic of territory.\" The logic of territory refers to state sovereignty and the right to control borders. The logic of capital refers to how global capitalism shapes state behavior and migration patterns.\n\nHe contends that imperialism, which he defines as economic and political practices facilitating global capital accumulation at the expense of postcolonial nations, underlies both underdevelopment and internal conflicts in Global South countries. These in turn produce forced and voluntary migration. Yet this causal chain gets ignored in mainstream analysis.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the article highlights how concepts of responsibility in international law could theoretically be applied to refugee situations but aren't. International law has doctrines of state responsibility, but these aren't invoked to argue that states whose interventions caused displacement should bear responsibility for admitting refugees.\n\nHe notes that the 1951 Convention and broader international refugee law were framed during the colonial period, and that colonialism's legacy shapes current arrangements. For instance, European colonial powers moved between 12 and 37 million people as indentured labor from 1834 to 1941. From 1850 to 1920, 40 million Europeans migrated overseas to settler colonies. Yet when a tiny fraction of that scale of movement occurs in reverse today, it's framed as a crisis.\n\nThe article points out that only 0.8% of the developing world's workforce has migrated to industrialized countries since World War II. If the Global South had emigrated at the same rate Europeans did historically, 800 million people would have moved north. Instead the actual number is one twentieth that proportion, and asylum seekers and refugees are only a fraction of even that small percentage.\n\nChimni argues for what he calls a 'dialectical approach' that would examine both formal legal obligations and these structural and historical factors. This would include developing norms of responsibility sharing that account for which nations' policies caused displacement, rather than current arrangements where refugee hosting falls disproportionately on neighboring countries in the Global South.\n\nHe proposes expanding the refugee definition to include climate displaced persons, which has particular relevance for South Asia given vulnerability to climate impacts. He also calls for giving refugees voice in asylum policy formation through what he terms the 'all affected principle' arguing that those subjected to political rule should have a say in such rule even without citizenship.\n\nThe article suggests that private corporations profiting from border control, which he terms the \"border industrial complex,\" represent how capital shapes contemporary migration governance. For example, Australia spent 1.4 Billion$ on a private company over 5 years without hosting a single refugee in those 5 years. He calls for applying human rights obligations to these private actors.\n\nWhether one agrees with the analysis or not, it centers questions about which nations bear responsibility for displacement and for those arguing why India hasn't signed the Refugee Convention, not only we have hosted a large no of refugees for mess created by Global North, ask them why have they changed their own standards.\n\nSource - [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1o9pqk0/indian_scholar_argues_refugee_flows_from/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK targets Russian oil giants and Nayara Energy in new sanctions aimed at cutting Kremlin revenue", "summary": "", "link": "https://regtechtimes.com/uk-targets-russian-oil-giants-and-nayara-energy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland votes to ban fur farming by 2033, with payouts for early closures", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/Artykul/3595152,poland-votes-to-ban-fur-farming-by-2033-with-payouts-for-early-closures", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sir David Attenborough becomes oldest daytime Emmys winner ever at 99, beating previous record holder Dick Van Dyke", "summary": "", "link": "https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/sir-david-attenborough-oldest-daytime-emmys-winner-99-1236555938/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Classic] On India's border, a huge mock war", "summary": "\n\n", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/06/world/on-india-s-border-a-huge-mock-war.html?unlocked_article_code=1.uU8.qGSQ.l8gj-aOkgs4R&amp;smid=url-share", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish government proposes new rights for unmarried partners, including same-sex couples", "summary": "Poland\u2019s ruling coalition has presented a bill that would allow unmarried partners, including same-sex couples, to sign an agreement granting them certain rights.\n\nThe proposal represents a compromise within the ruling coalition, where more liberal and conservative elements have failed to agree on a bill to introduce civil partnerships. The new measures are also designed to be acceptable to conservative President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, four figures from The Left (Lewica) and the Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL) \u2013 respectively the most left- and right-wing elements of the coalition \u2013 presented details of a proposed \u201claw on the status of the closest person\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found a compromise,\u201d said PSL leader and deputy prime minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz. \u201cThis bill is an example of agreement beyond divisions and proof that cooperation is possible. It is a bill that helps Poles \u2013 it gives them security, access to information, and certainty in difficult times.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter many months of talks, we have succeeded, we met PSL halfway,\u201d wrote The Left on social media. \u201cWe know that this is not everything we as The Left went to the elections with, but we are acting on the field that we have, with the hope that President Nawrocki will sign this bill.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe proposed law would allow a couple to sign an agreement before a notary that would grant them certain rights and obligations in their relationship that are currently available to married couples.\n\nThose would include exemptions from tax on inheritance and gifts between one another, the possibility to jointly file tax returns, and the right to mutually access medical information, have joint property ownership and to obtain leave from work to care for a partner.\n\nUrszula Pas\u0142awska, a PSL MP, said the newly proposed legislation differs from a\u00a0[previous bill to introduce civil partnerships](\u00a0\u2013 which failed to pass amid disagreements between PSL and The Left \u2013 because it makes the rights and obligations optional, to be decided on by the couple concluding the agreement.\n\nShe also noted that the state \u201cwould not be a regulator\u201d of such arrangements, but rather \u201can administrator of the information\u201d. The proposals also \u201cexclude issues related to children, such as custody or adoption\u201d, she added.\n\n\n\nEquality minister Katarzyn Kotula, who comes from The Left, added, however, that they are still \u201cdiscussing the details\u201d of the final shape of the bill, which she said \u201cwill be available soon\u201d, reports Business Insider Polska.\n\nKotula expressed confidence that the bill would be approved by parliament, where the government has a majority, but also hope that it was written in such a way that there would be the possibility of obtaining the signature of Nawrocki, which is needed for the bill to become law.\n\nEarlier this week, one of Nawrocki\u2019s senior aides, Marcin Przydacz, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP), that the president is \u201copen to discussions\u201d over the bill if it \u201ctruly addresses the status of the closest person and is devoid of the ideological elements characteristic of the extreme left\u201d.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk, speaking today in parliament, admitted that the bill \u201cwon\u2019t delight anyone, neither opponents nor proponents of more progressive solutions, but it offers a glimmer of hope\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we managed to reconcile these extremes in the coalition in which I am prime minister and find some ground for compromise is definitely a step forward,\u201d he added, quoted by news website Onet.\n\nMeanwhile, one of The Left\u2019s leaders, Robert Biedro\u0144, said that the proposed law is \u201cnot ideal but very much needed\u201d. He noted that he himself had long been waiting for the state to recognise his relationship with Krzysztof \u015amiszek, also a politician from The Left.\n\n\u201cTwenty-three years. That is how long my relationship has been waiting for the state to notice us,\u201d wrote Biedro\u0144 today on social media. \u201cLong years of dreams and fears, because what if something happens to one of us? According to the law, we are complete strangers to each other.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, in a statement issued on Thursday \u2013 before the bill had been formally announced today but when the outlines of it were already clear \u2013 a leading LGBT+ rights group, Mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 Nie Wyklucza, issued a statement criticising the plans.\n\nIt noted that the proposed solutions fell short of the idea of civil partnerships promised by parties within the ruling coaltion, and also criticised Kotula and PSL politicians for failing to mention LGBT+ people at all in their announcements regarding the bill.\n\nBy contrast, after today\u2019s announcement, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), Poland\u2019s main opposition party, condemned the proposals as \u201cultra-leftist solutions\u201d with the \u201cblatantly unconstitutional aims to replace traditional marriage with pseudo-unions\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/10/17/polish-government-proposes-new-rights-for-unmarried-partners-including-same-sex-couples/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Experts welcome \u2018landmark\u2019 moment for elephants after vaccine breakthrough", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/elephants-vaccine-elephant-endotheliotropic-herpesvirus-b2838643.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "rechenbrett - A go library for building Open Document spreadsheet (ods) files", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/fwilhe2/rechenbrett", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
