That can get expensive, and also is optimized for LLMs that run on APIs. Local LLMs usually do not understand what the tools want.\n\nSo what if I record my tool usage for like a month (prompt+ response) and use that as training data for fine tuning? Is that feasible? Would that teach an open source LLM to behave in the right way, or am I missing something?\nThank you ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1jjn7b4/question_on_collecting_fine_tuning_data/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ISPR calls out India Today for spreading misinformation.", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/a3pppmhpevqe1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fixing Common Open WebUI Errors: A Comprehensive Guide to JSON.parse &amp; 500 Internal Server Issues", "summary": "Open WebUI giving you headaches? \ud83d\ude2b Techlatest.net's guide fixes common errors like JSON.parse &amp; 500 Internal Server Errors on our Multi-LLM VM! \nNginx tweaks, RAM solutions, &amp; model management tips. \nGet back to building! \ud83d\udcaa \n\nMore details: \nFor free course: \n#LLM #OpenWebUI #Troubleshooting #AI #Nginx #TechSupport", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jjz2mx/fixing_common_open_webui_errors_a_comprehensive/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "profullstack/reddit-networking-bot", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/profullstack/reddit-networking-bot", "author": "None"}, {"title": "2 Hurriyat constituents -- the Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (JKPM) and the J&amp;K Democratic Political Movement (JKDPM) -- denounce separatism vow allegiance to Constitution", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theweek.in/wire-updates/national/2025/03/25/del79-jk-hurriyat-ld-saleem.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A first: Indigenous MRI machine set for trials at AIIMS", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/india/a-first-indigenous-mri-machine-set-for-trials-at-aiims/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Carolina the giant rat retires as a hero after saving many lives -- Last year, African giant pouched rats like Carolina prevented nearly 400,000 new cases of a deadly disease.

Cosine similarity is the obvious way to find what words are most similar to other words, but I\u2019m trying to use my novice linear algebra skills to find new relationships.\n\nI made on simple method that I hoped to find a word that\u2019s most similar to a pair of two other words. I would basically find the sub space (plane) that is spanned by word 1 and word 2, then project each other vector onto that, the find cosine similarity between each vector and its projection on the plane. I think the outcome tends to return words that are extremely similar to either word 1 or 2, instead of a blend of the two like I would hope for, but still a WIP.\n\nAnyways, my main question is if the word2vec google news embedding is the best for messing around with general semantics (I hope that\u2019s the right word) or meaning. Are there newer or better suited open source embeddings I should use?\n\nThanks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jja327/types_of_word_embeddings/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
