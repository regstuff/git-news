This produces a formatting similar to a \"programming language\". For me, it works very well on paper, forces the prompt to be very clear, concise and with little to no ambiguity, and I still think it's the best.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn.\n\nI thought of more than two ways: natural language.\n\nAnd Markdown, like XML.\n\nI once read that LLMs are trained to imitate humans (obviously) and therefore tend to translate Markdown (a more natural and organized form of formatting) better.\n\nBut I'm quite torn.\n\nHere's a quick example of the \"coding\" part. It's not really coding. It just uses variables and spaces to organize the prompt in a more organized way. It is a fragment of the formatter prompt.\n\nu 'A self-sufficient AI artifact that contains its own language specification (Schema), its compilation engine (Bootstrap Mandate), and its execution logic.
