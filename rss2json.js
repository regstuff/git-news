It was the fifth year that the march was held \u2013 the only other annual Pride gathering in the country besides that of Budapest \u2013 and was becoming a showcase of the city\u2019s commitment to freedom, diversity and the coexistence of minorities.\n\nThis year, however, politics loomed large. In March the country\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and his rightwing populist party [had voted to ban]( Pride events and allow the authorities to use facial recognition technology to identify and potentially fine those in attendance, a move Amnesty International described as a \u201cfull-frontal attack\u201d on LGBTQ+ people.\n\nEven so, in June tens of thousands of people [defied the ban]( to march in Budapest after Pride was rebranded as a municipal cultural event.\n\nMonths later, P\u00e9cs Pride [also attracted record numbers]( with as many as 8,000 people, including several members of the European parliament, taking part despite the police and the country\u2019s highest court confirming that the event was banned.\n\nFor the organiser G\u00e9za Buz\u00e1s-H\u00e1bel the nightmare began soon after. \u201cWe decided to hold P\u00e9cs Pride, despite the ban, because Hungary must remain a European country,\u201d the Romani LGBTQ+ activist said. \u201cFreedom of assembly is a fundamental human right, and we cannot allow political decisions to limit our community\u2019s visibility or self-expression.\u201d\n\n...\n\nBuz\u00e1s-H\u00e1bel said it was part of a much wider process playing out across Hungary. \u201cThis is not really about me. In the eyes of those in power, I am just a speck of dust,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is directed at my broader community, and the goal is to intimidate the people around me. They are using me as a tool to set an example for the entire country.\u201d\n\nHe spoke to the Guardian before a trip to Brussels, where, as a board member for Europe\u2019s largest Roma youth network, he was set to take part in a ceremony recognising Roma youth-led projects. The visit would also afford him the chance to meet with EU decision-makers and politicians interested in his case and the situation in Hungary, he said.\n\n\u201cThe real question is whether the European Union is ready to stand up for the principles it claims to represent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, in an EU member state, someone can face criminal prosecution simply for organising a peaceful Pride march \u2013 and the EU does not respond firmly \u2013 it sends the message that European values only matter until defending them requires real political courage.\u201d\n\nDespite the uncertainty that now plagued his life and career, he said he had no regrets. \u201cI have already experienced the personal cost of this system: I lost all my jobs, I was placed under secret service surveillance, and I now face potential criminal charges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut none of this changes the fact that I would organise Pride again in exactly the same way \u2013 and I will do so next year as well,\u201d he added. \u201cFor me, it is not just an event, but a stand for all those who need visibility and courage in such a hostile environment. Freedom sometimes comes at a high price, but the only thing I would truly regret is failing to stand up for my community.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/10/teacher-hungary-facing-criminal-charges-pride-event", "author": "None"}, {"title": "(Bolivian) Former President Luis Arce arrested in the Indigenous Fund case", "summary": "Google translated from Spanish: \n\nIn a surprise operation carried out this Wednesday in the Sopocachi neighborhood of La Paz, police arrested former president Luis Alberto Arce Catacora, who was transferred shortly afterward to the FELCC (Special Force to Combat Crime) headquarters to begin the corresponding procedures for an investigation related to the alleged misuse of public funds.\n\nFormer Minister of the Presidency, Mar\u00eda Nela Prada, denounced the arrest as an arbitrary measure and alerted the international community.\n\nAround 3:00 p.m., Arce was placed in a white van and taken directly to the offices of the anti-crime unit.

It ordered Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe European court emphasised, however, that its ruling \u201cdoes not require the member state to provide for marriage between persons of the same sex in its national law\u201d. It also said that the decision \u201cdoes not undermine national identity or pose a threat to public policy\u201d.\n\nBut those arguments have been questioned by COMECE, which argues that the CJEU\u2019s decision threatens to interfere with the right, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, for national governments to regulate issues relating to marriages and families.\n\nThe EU ruling \u201cimpoverishes the meaning\u201d of this guarantee \u201cby underlining that in exercising this competence, each member state must comply with EU law,\u201d wrote the bishops.\n\nCOMECE also said that the CJEU had given a \u201cdisappointingly limited role to the respect for member states\u2019 \u2018national identities\u2019\u201d. It argued that, \u201cfor some member states, the definition of marriage forms part of their national identity\u201d.\n\nPoland is one of the EU\u2019s most religious member states, with around\u00a0[70% of its population identifying as Catholic]( The preamble to the country\u2019s constitution refers to \u201cour culture rooted in the Christian heritage of the nation\u201d.\n\n[Polling](\u00a0by the Ipsos research agency this year found that only a minority of Poles, 31%, support the introduction of same-sex marriage. However, a majority, 62%, were in favour of allowing some form of legal recognition of same-sex relationships.\n\nIn their statement, COMECE expressed concern that the CJEU\u2019s latest ruling \u201cwill have an impact on national family law legal systems and may foster pressure to amend them\u201d.\n\nIt \u201ceffectively creates a convergence of matrimonial-law effects, even though the \\[European\\] Union does not have a mandate to harmonise family law\u201d, say the bishops. They also worry that the ruling could \u201cpave the way to future similar legal approaches regarding surrogacy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of judgements give rise to anti-European sentiments in member states and can be easily instrumentalised,\u201d they conclude.\n\nThe CJEU\u2019s ruling requires Poland to introduce recognition of same-sex marriages conducted in other member states. If the country does not, it could face ongoing fines until it does so.\n\nThe Polish government has\u00a0[indicated that it will respect the ruling]( However, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also declared that \u201cthe EU cannot impose anything on us on this issue\u201d and \u201cwherever matters must be decided by the nation state and national law, we will adhere to this principle\u201d.\n\nEven before the ruling, the government had\u00a0[presented a bill](\u00a0intended to allow unmarried partners, including same-sex couples, to sign an agreement granting them certain rights.\n\nHowever, it has not yet been approved by parliament and, even if it is, faces a potential veto from conservative, opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, who has said he will not support any measures that \u201cundermine the unique and constitutionally protected status of marriage\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/09/catholic-bishops-voice-concern-over-eu-court-order-for-poland-to-recognise-same-sex-marriages/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "National Guardsman kills 3 fellow service members hours after car bomb kills 5 in cartel stronghold in Mexico", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guardsman-kills-fellow-service-members-mexico/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "With flags and fireworks, Syrians celebrate one year since fall of al-Assad", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/8/with-flags-and-fireworks-syrians-celebrate-one-year-since-fall-of-al-assad", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018The patriarchy runs deep\u2019: women still getting a raw deal in the workplace as equality remains a dream", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/10/women-workplace-equality-gender-world-un-report", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
