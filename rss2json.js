By 1934 both girls, now considered spinsters,  were living together in London and working civil service jobs although Ida would soon be a successful romance author under the pen name Mary Burchell (her first book was published in 1936). Ida and Louise both had a passion for opera and frequently traveled so they could see their favorite operas. That year Ida and Louise were both in Salzburg attending an opera festival. They became acquainted with a Romanian opera singer named Viorica Ursuleac and her Austrian husband, a conductor named Clemens Krauss who were both secretly involved in helping Jews escape from the Nazis. The sisters were told about the plight of Jews in Austria and Germany and what they heard moved them so much that they knew they needed to act. Back in Britain the sisters contributed their own money and later donations from friends to help resettle Jews in Britain. Later they agreed to covertly transport expensive jewelry owned by Jews out of occupied territory. This was illegal as Jews weren't allowed to take any valuable items out of the country so Ida and Louise took a big risk doing this. That's when Ida had to transport the large diamond brooch and got the idea to pin it to the front of her cheap cardigan from Marks and Spencer's. It worked so well that Ida and Louise repeated the ruse several more times. On the rare occasions when they were stopped by officials they would \u201cdo the nervous British spinster act\u201d and act so crazy that any official would back off. As an example I'll quote this anecdote from the article \"When an Austrian frontier official questioned Louise\u2019s opulent string of pearls that she was wearing along with her otherwise inexpensive outfit, she acted affronted, exclaiming, \u201cAnd why not?!\u2019 She frantically ran to a mirror and looked at herself, all the while yelling at the inspector, \u201cWhat is wrong with my appearance?

These aren't theoretical concepts\u2014they're practical approaches that immediately enhance what you get from any LLM.\n\n# Zero-Shot vs. One-Shot: The Critical Difference\n\nMost people use \"zero-shot\" prompting by default\u2014simply asking the AI to do something without examples:\n\n    Classify this movie review as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\n    \n    Review: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction humanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving, unchecked. I wish there were more movies like this masterpiece.\n\nThis works for simple tasks, but I recently came across this excellent post\u00a0[\"The Art of Basic Prompting\"](\u00a0which demonstrates how dramatically results improve with \"one-shot\" prompting\u2014adding just a single example of what you want:\n\n    Classify these emails by urgency level. Use only these labels: URGENT, IMPORTANT, or ROUTINE.\n    \n    Email: \"Team, the client meeting has been moved up to tomorrow at 9am. Please adjust your schedules accordingly.\"\n    Classification: IMPORTANT\n    \n    Email: \"There's a system outage affecting all customer transactions. Engineering team needs to address immediately.\"\n    Classification:\n\nThe difference is striking\u2014instead of vague, generic outputs, you get precisely formatted responses matching your example.\n\n# Few-Shot Prompting: The Advanced Technique\n\nFor complex tasks like extracting structured data, the article demonstrates how providing multiple examples creates consistent, reliable outputs:\n\n    Parse a customer's pizza order into JSON:\n    \n    EXAMPLE:\n    I want a small pizza with cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni.\n    JSON Response:\n    {\n      \"size\": \"small\",\n      \"type\": \"normal\",\n      \"ingredients\": [[\"cheese\", \"tomato sauce\", \"pepperoni\"]]\n    }\n    \n    EXAMPLE:\n    Can I get a large pizza with tomato sauce, basil and mozzarella\n    {\n      \"size\": \"large\",\n      \"type\": \"normal\",\n      \"ingredients\": [[\"tomato sauce\", \"basil\", \"mozzarella\"]]\n    }\n    \n    Now, I would like a large pizza, with the first half cheese and mozzarella. And the other half tomato sauce, ham and pineapple.\n    JSON Response:\n\n# The Principles Behind Effective Prompting\n\nWhat makes these techniques work so well? According to the article, effective prompts share these characteristics:\n\n1. **They provide patterns to follow**\u00a0\\- Examples show exactly what good outputs look like\n2. **They reduce ambiguity**\u00a0\\- Clear examples eliminate guesswork about format and style\n3. **They activate relevant knowledge**\u00a0\\- Well-chosen examples help the AI understand the specific domain\n4. **They constrain responses**\u00a0\\- Examples naturally limit the AI to relevant outputs\n\n# Practical Applications I've Tested\n\nI've been implementing these techniques in various scenarios with remarkable results:\n\n* **Customer support**: Using example-based prompts to generate consistently helpful, on-brand responses\n* **Content creation**: Providing examples of tone and style rather than trying to explain them\n* **Data extraction**: Getting structured information from unstructured text with high accuracy\n* **Classification tasks**: Achieving near-human accuracy by showing examples of edge cases\n\nThe most valuable insight from Boonstra's article is that you don't need to be a prompt engineering expert\u2014you just need to understand these fundamental techniques and apply them systematically.\n\n# Getting Started Today\n\nIf you're new to prompt engineering, start with these practical steps:\n\n1. Take a prompt you regularly use and add a single high-quality example\n2. For complex tasks, provide 2-3 diverse examples that cover different patterns\n3. Experiment with example placement (beginning vs. throughout the prompt)\n4. Document what works and build your own library of effective prompt patterns\n\nWhat AI challenges are you facing that might benefit from these techniques?

This resulted in increased supply of US treasuries, decrease in prices, increase in yields, weakening of dollar...\n\nOf the $8.5T worth of US treasuries owned externally, Canada has $350B, Japan has $1T, and EU has $1.5T. China has \\~$850B and India has $225B.\n\nGiven the high volumes, Canada, EU, and Japan were able to spook US in withdrawing the tariff. This seems to be an effective tool in this regard.\n\nGiven this dynamic, my question is: What should India do wrt US treasuries?\n\n* Given relatively cheaper US treasuries available in the secondary market, should India buy it (they have decent enough USD reserves for now) to increase the US treasuries they own? Should India use that as potential threat by coordinating their steps with others in this regard?\n* Would buying more US treasuries by India create other issues for India? Other than fewer $$s for buying their net imports, I don't see any other downside...\n\nWould love to understand the dynamics that could be at play from someone who's better at macro economics than I am!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1jx3y0b/what_tools_does_india_have_for_tariff_war_with_us/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel\u2019s military says air force reservists who condemned Gaza war will be fired", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-military-says-air-force-reservists-who-condemned-gaza-war-will-be-fired", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
