This means that as learning progresses, the model\u2019s performance decreases. A common finding among multiple experiments is that performance decreases from about 5 to 10% steps or more. It also reduces the average cosine similarity score of the benchmark dataset. For example, the average of the cosine similarity scores of the pair Anchor and Postivies and the average of the cosine similarity scores of the pair Anchor and negatives are both lowered. This phenomenon appears to be a different result in that when setting scale(temperature) = 0.01, the result should be that the cosine similarity is distributed within a distribution of 0.7 to 1.0( \n\n\n\nbase models were used.
