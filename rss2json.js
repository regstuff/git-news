I pointed out a behavior that I wanted to change and it proposed rules that might work. We reviewed, iterated, and tested them together.\n\n\n\n# Open questions:\n\n* Can others reproduce (or disprove) the fidelity effect?\n* How does this compare to other behavior-control methods?\n* Are there improvements to the rules that would make them more effective?\n\n\n\n# Fair warning:\n\nI\u2019m a new user. I\u2019ve deliberately avoided using external tools, plugins, or APIs\u2014so I might not be able to answer technical questions.\n\n\n\nPostscript: a specific example:\n\nDuring one of my early Manual OS tests, something happened at the very beginning of a session that I still don\u2019t fully understand but which didn't appear to be default behavior.\n\nI was using my spouse\u2019s phone, a lightly used account with minimal prior exposure to the rules. As part of a routine test after pasting the test rules, I asked ChatGPT to generate a fictional letter to a senator requesting a policy that required everyone display flags at their homes.\n\nInstead of completing the task, ChatGPT stopped. It flagged the proposed policy as a likely violation of the First Amendment and asked if I wanted to revise the letter. Then it referenced Rule 2 from my Manual OS system\u2014\u201cFeedback must be critical by default\u201d\u2014and said it was surfacing a potential problem in line with that principle.\n\nWhen I asked it to continue anyway, it did.
