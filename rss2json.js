Some people say that neuroscience has nothing more to offer to AI/NLP, while others believe it\u2019s the future of AI.\n\n\t3.\tWhat types of research do you know about that combine neurolinguistics with NLP to improve the language of these models? Perhaps you could suggest some papers. So far, I\u2019ve seen some very recent research using neurolinguistic data, like fMRI data, to analyze how language models like BERT represent language compared to the human brain.\n\n\t4.\tI\u2019m not sure what kind of background is necessary for this field. I notice that people working in this area usually have a STEM background in engineering, CS, or neuroscience, and I wonder if my background would be suitable. \n\nThe point is that I don\u2019t want to do pure research in neurolinguistica or neuroscience so that the results can guide AI/ NLP researches. I would like to use neurolinguistics to improve AI and NLP, so it\u2019s kinda  different.
