I'm wondering if there was a way to generate embeddings locally to compare against articles published at the same time and associate the articles that are essentially about the same event/story. It doesn't have to be perfect, just something that will catch the more obvious associations.\n\nI've looked at various approaches (word2vec) and there seem to be a lot of options, but I know this is a fast moving field and I'm curious if there are are any interesting new options or tried-and-true algorithms/libraries for generating document-level embeddings to be used for clustering/association.

So my background is in anthropology and archaeology. I attend a university in the U.S and have been learning religiously about the looting industry that takes place. That being said I would like to propose an alternative to the common narrative. I\u2019ll do this by proposing an example.\nA person is walking down the beach in Florida, there\u2019s large sand dunes and fine sand and pebbles with high surf. This person stumbles across an intact projectile point in the tidal zone. They do one of the following.\n\nA) leave it there as they know that\u2019s what the law states and it likely gets lost to the waves and possibly destroyed.\nB) they pick it up and because they know it\u2019s illegal they keep it and don\u2019t tell anyone\n\nBoth of these outcomes are bad in my opinion. But if you look for the answer to this question of what to do you\u2019ll hear to leave it there. As Archaeologists I feel we should be educating the public on how to responsibly collect and report surface artifacts in danger of being lost. For example if the recommendation was to document a general location through photo and phone gps before picking up an artifact and contacting archaeologists/park officials this would both save more artifacts and it would prevent people from being sneaky about picking up artifacts. I would imagine most people that collect artifacts, wether it be coins or pottery or lithics want these things to end up in the right hand but won\u2019t speak up out of fear of legal ramifications \n\nBasically I\u2019m just wondering if the discussion around artifact findings by the public should be looked at a bit differently. Right now it doesn\u2019t seem entirely productive. Besides dickheads are still gonna break the law, I just feel creating a stigma around non archaeologists finding artifacts is making the problem bigger \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1gpzod0/amateur_collections_and_the_law/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France's Marine Le Pen rejects embezzlement claims as presidential bid hangs in the balance", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/france-le-pen-trial-embezzling-funds-far-right-6f930606aa5aede15b01e84d96922e19", "author": "None"}, {"title": "U\u0405 prohibits airlines from flying to Haiti and UN suspends flights after 2 planes were shot by gangs", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/haiti-violence-gangs-airport-90dc8d26bc58eb9b214385ac10f315a2", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shell wins landmark climate case against green groups in Dutch appeal, overturning an earlier ruling requiring it to cut its carbon emissions by 45%.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx240l9xq2yo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Alibaba's research unit Qwen has introduced a new series of AI models called Qwen-2.5-Coder, designed to help programmers write, analyze, and understand code.", "summary": "", "link": "https://the-decoder.com/alibabas-qwen-ai-unit-releases-capable-new-models-to-help-developers-write-and-analyze-code/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PAHO re-verifies Brazil as a measles-free country", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.paho.org/en/news/12-11-2024-paho-re-verifies-brazil-measles-free-country", "author": "None"}, {"title": "LGBTQ+ groups, after years of trying, will finally be able to openly march in Staten Island's St. Patrick's Parade", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.silive.com/news/2024/11/exclusive-after-60-years-staten-islands-st-patricks-parade-will-be-inclusive-of-lgbtq-groups.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenAI reportedly plans to release full version of its o1 \"reasoning\" model this year.", "summary": "", "link": "https://the-decoder.com/openai-reportedly-plans-to-release-full-version-of-its-o1-reasoning-model-this-year/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
