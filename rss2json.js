Amir Ohana, Speaker of the Israeli Knesset, and Mike Johnson, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, sent letters to the heads of parliaments in many countries, requesting support for the US President's bid. W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty also received this request.\n\n\"I will not support the Nobel nomination for President Trump because he does not deserve it,\" stated Speaker W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty.

But an industry body that represents supermarkets and grocery stores in Poland argues that it will significantly raise costs for retailers while potentially confusing customers and creating more environmental waste.\n\nLast November, the\u00a0agricultural ministry adopted a regulation introducing the new rules. The government hopes they will encourage the purchase of local produce by helping consumers identify products originating from Poland more easily.\n\nUnder current EU regulations, retailers must already provide written country-of-origin information for unpackaged fruit and vegetables. In Poland, many homegrown products are also voluntarily marked with a \u201cProdukt Polski\u201d (Polish Product) logo that incorporates the flag and national colours.\n\nHowever, the new rules will require retailers to label all loose fruit and vegetables with a national flag graphic, which must be \u201cplaced on a sign or in another place easily accessible to the buyer\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is intended to provide consumers with clearer information about the country of origin of products \u2013 both verbally and graphically,\u201d says the agriculture ministry.\n\nBut, in a statement issued last week, the Polish Organisation of Commerce and Distribution (POHiD), which represents leading retail chains operating in Poland, such as Biedronka, Carrefour, and \u017babka, questioned whether the flag labels are necessary, and argued they may even be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cIn the opinion of POHiD, this change will not only fail to enhance the recognition of Polish products, but may even depreciate the \u2018Produkt Polski\u2019 brand, visually equating it with products from any region of the world,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe organisation also noted that some national flags are very similar to one another, making it hard to differentiate them on electronic displays and potentially confusing customers.\n\nThe industry body estimates that the new regulation would raise costs for a single large retailer operating in Poland by an average of about 17 million zloty (\u20ac4 million) a year.\n\n\u201cIn practice, this \\[cost\\] includes modifying labelling systems, updating software and databases, changing central product management processes, and adapting labelling across a very large number of retail outlets,\u201d Karol Tyszka, POHiD\u2019s public relations manager, told Notes from Poland.\n\nPOHiD also highlighted the potential negative environmental impact of the new regulation. \u201cThe additional printing of colored labels is contrary to environmental goals and the principle of sustainable development,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, similar regulations for honey, juices and jams will come into force on 14 June. The agriculture ministry says that products made available on the market before the new sets of rules take effect may continue to be sold until existing stocks run out.\n\nPoland was the EU\u2019s third-largest producer of fruits, berries and nuts in 2024, behind Italy and Spain, and its fourth-largest producer of fresh vegetables, behind Spain, Italy and France, according to Eurostat.\n\nLast November,\u00a0 the agriculture ministry\u00a0[recommended](\u00a0that the government buy the Polish assets of French supermarket giant Carrefour, which is looking to exit Poland.\n\nThey could then be used to create a state-owned grocery retail network that would help challenge the \u201cdominance of foreign discount chains\u201d and support Polish farmers and other producers, said the ministry.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/04/poland-to-require-retailers-to-add-flags-of-origin-to-loose-fruit-and-vegetables/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
