Rather than just deploy another civility enforcement period to perform an annual sweep, we took to analyzing the patterns in which recurring rule-breakers appeared, what sort of profiles rule-breakers had, and how astroturfers operated.\n\nWe also heard the frustration regarding the forced megathreading of articles related to active conflicts, as users stated it was basically suppressing the topic, as users are significantly less likely to visit the megathread than new posts. However, we also note that people were also frustrated with the amount of dubious or misinformative submissions that came with the fog of war prior to the megathread enforcements.\n\nWe observed several things:\n\n* **Civility-violating users** are largely users who only are visiting the subreddit when posts with high upvote count appear in their default feed, and have not read the rules, period. They are also likely to have just read a title and skipped the article, and proceed to post a short kneejerk reactive comment.\n* **Astroturfers** primarily work across several subreddits and do not have any interest in the engaging with the community beyond outputting their comments. In addition, astroturfing accounts making link submissions tend to be less than 1 year old.\n* **Spammers** only respond to posts in top-level comments with very short comments.\n\nTherefore, we have made the following Automod changes and raised the bar for participation:\n\n* The basic entry for comment participation been upped from 100 comment karma to 200 karma.\n* Accounts must now be 1 year old to post. We will continue to monitor agendaposting traits in 1+ year old accounts.\n* Link submissions related to active conflicts with title keywords associated with countries in active conflicts will now be allowed. Automatic link flair will now to be assigned to these submissions that indicate users must be flaired to comment in them.\n* Commenters will need to self-assign a flair in order to engage in \"Flaired Commenters Only\" posts.\n* Top-level comments must now have a minimum of 150 characters. While succinctness is a valued trait in writing, this update also blocks out a large number of shallow, kneejerk comments, and we believe having top-level comments require more writing effort to reach the 150-character minimum makes users be more thorough, and helps provide more nuanced discussion. The comment character minimum restriction does not apply to comments replying to the top-level comment.\n\nWe apologize for the delay in announcing these changes after they were deployed, due to IRL constraints, and will continue to observe the subreddit for how best to improve r/anime_titties.\n\nWe are open to feedback on these new measures and other ways to improve the subreddit.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1erbas7/rule_and_automoderator_updates_to_address/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India, Israel join hands for new water technology centre at IIT Madras", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-israel-join-hands-for-new-water-technology-centre-at-iit-madras-124081301333_1.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tens of thousands in Sudan risk death if world does not step up response, says IOM", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tens-thousands-sudan-risk-death-if-world-does-not-step-up-response-says-iom-2024-08-13/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Closed borders with India cause food, fuel shortages in western Myanmar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/closed-borders-india-cause-food-fuel-shortages-western-myanmar-08122024200118.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Genomic ancestry and social dynamics of the last hunter-gatherers of Atlantic France", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2310545121?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ancient plant artefact reveals humanity's epic journey to Australia through the northern route", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2443538-ancient-plant-artefact-reveals-humanitys-epic-journey-to-australia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Boeing discovered a new set of problems in its 737s, further slowing deliveries", "summary": "", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-discovered-set-problems-737s-163902731.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Georgia tops college football AP preseason poll for second year in a row", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia tops college football AP preseason poll for second year in a row</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPbG4tRnlraVRDNjhVeXVCUUZOZGQ4cnhlV0NNR080ZG1lVGNjR0k4Mm9SSDBlNWxkRTRrS21odkE3Mmp5MURBQ1dBWW04Q0pJM1pvQ2R0WU1SVEpTUUpQSWdfd1E2Y2xjYXFITWs1Z0J1VlcyUG9LVnMtbjBHbGtnWExJRDRzNzNnYXNBSnFFUUVZUHk0Sng2eGxfQS1MN21rMVIzRkVLaVg?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-08-13", "author": "None"}]}}};
