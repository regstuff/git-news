Some declared themselves \u201cfree from LGBT ideology\u201d, while most adopted \u201cCharters of Family Rights\u201d that declared marriage to be exclusively between a man and a woman and pledged to \u201cprotect children from moral corruption\u201d.\n\nHowever, the resolutions \u2013 which were mainly symbolic, with no legal consequences \u2013 were gradually repealed, primarily due to the\u00a0[threat of losing European funds]( The final resolution, in the town of \u0141a\u0144cut, was\u00a0[revoked in April this year](\n\n\n\nIn a newly published\u00a0[discussion paper]( Pawel Adrjan, an economist at the University of Oxford, and Jan Gromadzki, from the Vienna University of Economics and Business, sought to assess the impact of the resolutions and the rhetoric around them.\n\nThey analysed job search behaviour in places with such resolutions, and compared it to neighbouring areas. The researchers examined 67 million clicks on job advertisements made by Polish users between 2016 and 2021.\n\nThey found that,\u00a0after the adoption of anti-LGBT+ resolutions, residents in those areas significantly increased their searches for jobs outside their home region. Searches for jobs in other Polish municipalities rose by around 12%, while searches for jobs abroad increased by approximately 15%.\n\nBoth within Poland and across Europe, job seekers focused on regions perceived as LGBT+ friendly. In Poland, searches concentrated on areas that had not passed anti-LGBT+ resolutions. Internationally, the most popular destinations were countries where same-sex marriage is legal, such as Germany and the UK.\n\n\n\nThe researchers also observed that job searches for positions abroad were particularly high in regions with anti-LGBT+ resolutions that had not previously shown strong support for far-right parties.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a place that\u2019s extremely conservative and consistently votes for far-right parties, you\u2019re not surprised when it adopts such a resolution,\u201d Gromadzki, one of the authors, told Notes from Poland.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re in a region with only moderate support for \\[such\\] parties and it suddenly introduces this kind of declaration, it\u2019s a shock. That shock leads people to update their beliefs about the local social norms.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe authors were limited in the personal data they could access: they did not know the job seekers\u2019 age, gender or sexual orientation, only the region they were searching from and where they were looking for a new job. However, they were able to observe the types of job postings people clicked on.\n\nGromadzki notes: \u201cWe expected the strongest effects for high-paying jobs, but actually, we saw increased interest across the board. In all occupational categories \u2013 low, middle, and high-paying \u2013 job search activity went up.\u201d\n\nTo determine whether the increased intensity in job searches had a real impact on migration flows, the researchers turned to census data.\n\nThey found that, in the affected counties, the population of people aged 18 to 27 declined by about 1% compared to neighbouring areas. After ruling out other factors such as birth and death rates, they concluded that the rise in job searches likely correlates with actual outward migration.\n\n\n\nEven so, the researchers cannot say for certain whether LGBT+ individuals were the ones leaving. Indeed, Gromadzki believes the rhetoric may have affected a broader group.\n\n\u201cI think it also impacted allies, friends, families \u2013 and even young parents who feared that if their children turned out to be LGBTQ, they would grow up in a homophobic and transphobic environment. That fear may have motivated them to seek better opportunities elsewhere,\u201d says the researcher.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a migration story \u2013 it\u2019s much broader,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe already know that the LGBT+ resolutions affected people\u2019s mental health and had political consequences. So even though it was \u2018just words\u2019, they had real power to change people\u2019s lives\n\n\n\nThe census data also indicated that it was primarily young women who left the affected regions. The authors suggest this is unsurprising, as anti-LGBT+ rhetoric often goes hand in hand with conservative views on women\u2019s rights and traditional gender roles.\n\nFurthermore, young women in Poland often\u00a0[have more socially progressive views](\u00a0than men in their age group.\n\nAdrjan and Gromadzki\u2019s findings were published by IZA \u2013 Institute of Labor Economics, a non-profit research institute based in Bonn, Germany.

Quad was drummed up to a vaccine supply chain alliance where India supported the end production and packaging. \n\nToday, rare earths are in similar situation. West has realized they have handed over a massive lever in Chinese hands. Years of cheap cost and superior quality meant there was no need to look for an alternative. That has conclusively changed. \n\nIndia could be positioned again as the refinement hub for rare earths (side note: As I understand the refinement step is extremely polluting which I think will make Australia and USA outsource this job). The challenge right now is a lot of other countries are trying to insert themselves into this mix (e.g. our ever friendly neighbor). But ofcourse capability ramp up and security is a challenge.
