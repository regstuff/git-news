However, even ahead of today\u2019s decision, the justice minister had already proposed a new bill reforming the KRS intended to take into account Duda\u2019s concerns.\n\nThe KRS is the body responsible for nominating judges. In 2017, the then PiS government changed how the council\u2019s 25 members were selected. Previously, most were chosen by judges themselves. However, after PiS\u2019s reforms, most were selected by politicians.\n\nThe move was widely condemned by expert bodies as undermining judicial independence. Various\u00a0[Polish\u00a0](\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings have found the KRS to no longer be a legitimate body due to its lack of independence.\n\nThat in turn has called into question the status of around 2,500 judges who have been appointed through the KRS since it was overhauled by PiS, and the huge number of rulings issued by them.\n\nFor example, around 60% of Supreme Court judges, including its chief justice, were nominated by the so-called \u201cneo-KRS\u201d.\n\nWhen PiS lost power in December 2023, the new government \u2013 a broad coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk \u2013 pledged to restore the rule of law, including\u00a0[depoliticising the KRS](\n\nA bill to that effect was approved by\u00a0[parliament in April 2024]( However, in August of that year, Duda refused to sign it into law, instead referring it to the TK for assessment. He argued that the bill was unconstitutional because it ended the current KRS\u2019s term prematurely.\n\nOn Thursday, the court agreed with Duda, ruling that the fixed terms of office for KRS members are essential to the body\u2019s functioning and cannot be cut short through legislation.\n\nThe TK judge who delivered the justification for the ruling, Krystyna Paw\u0142owicz, who was a PiS MP until being appointed to the court, noted that not only does their decision mean the bill has been rejected, but that lawmakers must avoid trying to reintroduce provisions the TK has found unconstitutional.\n\nFailure to comply with this could lead to criminal proceedings, said Paw\u0142owicz, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nEven before today\u2019s ruling, justice minister Waldemar \u017burek had already\u00a0[put forward a fresh draft bill](\u00a0intended as a \u201ccompromise\u201d that would take account of Duda\u2019s concerns. \u017burek\u2019s proposal would still ensure that KRS members are mostly chosen by the judiciary, but would not cut short the current council\u2019s term.\n\n\u017burek\u2019s bill still needs the approval of the cabinet and parliament. But even if, as seems likely, it obtains those, it appears unlikely that President Karol Nawrocki \u2013 who replaced Duda in August and is also aligned with PiS \u2013 would sign it.\n\nEarlier this week, Nawrocki\u2019s chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, condemned the \u201cterror of lawlessness \\[being\\] perpetrated by Minister \u017burek at the behest of Donald Tusk\u201d.\n\nHe told broadcaster RMF that the president would, by January at the latest, present his own plan to \u201crestore normality in the justice system\u2026instead of the terror and chaos that currently exists\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*, Bogucki said that Nawrocki\u2019s plan would include a presidential bill to overhaul the KRS that would still see most of its members chosen by parliament but would change the procedure in ways intended to offer a compromise.\n\nAccording to the newspaper\u2019s sources, if Nawrocki\u2019s proposals are rejected by the ruling coalition, the president would seek to call a national referendum to settle the issue. Nawrocki himself publicly suggested that idea earlier this month.\n\nMeanwhile, deputy justice minister S\u0142awomir Pa\u0142ka told the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily that, unless a solution is found soon, the rules introduced under PiS will require parliament to appoint new members of the KRS in May 2026.\n\nThat process would be controlled by Tusk\u2019s ruling coalition, which holds a parliamentary majority. \u201cThis, I suspect, is not necessarily to President Nawrocki\u2019s liking,\u201d said Pa\u0142ka.\n\nLast week, in an escalation of both the rule-of-law crisis and the conflict between the government and the president, Nawrocki announced that he was\u00a0[refusing to approve 46 judicial nominations](\u00a0because the judges in question are supportive of the unconstitutional actions of the government.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/20/constitutional-court-rejects-government-bill-overhauling-body-at-heart-of-polands-rule-of-law-crisis/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
