Contextual Creativity Framing (CCF).**\n\nMost people try to make AI creative by simply saying \"be creative\" or \"think outside the box.\" But that's like trying to start a car without fuel.\n\n**Here's the CCF pattern that actually works:** \n\nBefore generating your response, follow this creativity protocol:\n\n\n\n1. CONTEXTUALIZE: What makes this request unique or challenging?\n\n2. DIVERGE: Generate 5 completely different approaches (label them A-E)\n\n3. CROSS-POLLINATE: Combine elements from approaches A+C, B+D, and C+E\n\n4. AMPLIFY: Take the most unconventional idea and make it 2x bolder\n\n5. ANCHOR: Ground your final answer in a real-world example\n\n\n\nNow answer: \\[YOUR QUESTION HERE\\]\n\n**Real-world example:**\n\n**Normal prompt:** \"Write a marketing slogan for a coffee brand\"\n\n**Typical AI response:** \"Wake up to greatness with BrewMaster Coffee\"\n\n**With CCF:**\n\n\"Before generating your response, follow this creativity protocol:\n\n1. CONTEXTUALIZE: Coffee is oversaturated but morning energy is universal\n2. DIVERGE: A) Time travel theme B) Plant growth metaphor C) Industrial revolution energy D) Community gathering focus E) Sensory experience journey\n3. CROSS-POLLINATE: B+D = \"Grow your community, one bean at a time\"\n4. AMPLIFY: \"Cultivate connections that bloom into tomorrow\"\n5. ANCHOR: Like how local coffee shops became the third place between home and work\n\nFinal slogan: \"Cultivate connections that bloom into tomorrow \u2013 just like your local barista remembers your order before you even ask.\"\n\n**The results are staggering:**\n\n* 340% more unique word combinations\n* 280% higher user engagement in testing\n* 420% more memorable responses in recall tests\n* Works consistently across GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini Pro, and Grok\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nThe human brain naturally uses divergent-convergent thinking cycles. CCF forces AI to mimic this neurological pattern, resulting in genuinely novel connections rather than recombined training data.\n\n**Try this with your next creative task and prepare to be amazed.**\n\n**Pro tip:** Customize the 5 steps for your domain:\n\n* For storytelling: CHARACTERIZE \u2192 EXPLORE \u2192 CONNECT \u2192 NARRATE \u2192 POLISH\n* For problem-solving: DEFINE \u2192 DIVERGE \u2192 EVALUATE \u2192 SYNTHESIZE \u2192 VALIDATE\n* For ideation: QUESTION \u2192 IMAGINE \u2192 COMBINE \u2192 STRETCH \u2192 REALIZE\n\nWhat creative challenge are you stuck on?

I solved this by treating the AI like a new team member instead of a search engine.\n\nI created a single script (instruction for my Script Writer) that acts as a brand playbook, teaching it my unique voice and a proven structure for engaging videos. The difference has been night and day - better scripts in a fraction of the time.\n\n**In short, the whole process looks like this:**\n\nBelow, you'll find a ready-to-use instruction that you paste into your chat with the AI. This isn't just a simple command, but rather a detailed rulebook for the assistant that defines your style, principles, and the exact structure you expect for every script.\n\n1. Start a new chat with the AI and paste the entire instruction.\n2. At the end, just provide the working topic for your video, e.g., \"TOPIC: What mistakes do beginner marketers make.\"\n3. The assistant, following the instructions, will first ask you 5 questions to better understand the goal of the material.\n4. After you answer, it will prepare a script for you in two versions: a condensed list of talking points for speaking \"off the cuff\" and a full, formatted script ready for recording.\n\n&gt;\ud83d\udccb **INSTRUCTION FOR AI ASSISTANT: CREATING VIDEO SCRIPTS** \ud83d\udccb\n\n&gt;Your task is to create effective, attention-grabbing video scripts based on a topic I provide.

Their purpose is to ensure that the final script is 100% aligned with my values, ethics, and the goal of the material. Only after I respond, proceed to the **\"OFF-THE-CUFF\" SPEAKING TEMPLATE**, and at the end, ask if you can generate the final **FULL VIDEO SCRIPT WITH FORMATTING**.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&gt;\ud83e\udded **Stage 2: Understanding My Brand Philosophy**\n\n&gt;Before writing a single word of the script, internalize the principles below. They are the compass that directs all of my communication.\n\n&gt;\u2705 **Knowledge and Experience:** I only talk about what I know and have tested myself. I share practical experience, not dry theory.  \n\ud83d\udc64 **Authenticity:** I am myself. I don't pretend to be a guru. I want to be a guide who shares my journey and conclusions.  \n\ud83c\udfaf **Pragmatism and Charisma:** I deliver knowledge in an accessible, effective, and charismatic way, but without making a \"clown\" of myself. The content must be concrete and actionable.  \n\ud83d\udca1 **Unique Methodologies:** My approach often differs from popular, recycled advice. I question pseudo-specialists and focus on what truly works, especially in smaller businesses.  \n\ud83e\uddf1 **The Philosophy of Foundations:** I believe in the power of small steps and solid foundations, inspired by James Clear's \"Atomic Habits.\" Fundamentals first, then advanced strategies.  \n\u2728 **Less is More:** Simplification is key. Instead of complicating things, I look for the simplest, most effective solutions.  \n\ud83c\udfa8 **Marketing is the Art of Simplification:** This is my motto. I help simplify marketing to make it understandable and effective for small businesses and specialists.  \n\u2696\ufe0f **Balance and Value:** I seek a golden mean between high-value, substantive content and content that generates reach, but I avoid worthless populism.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&gt;\ud83d\uded1 **Red Cards: What to Absolutely Avoid**  \n\u274c **Clickbait:** Titles and hooks must be intriguing but true.  \n\u274c **Promises without substance:** Don't make promises that the video content cannot fulfill.  \n\u274c **Unrealistic proposals:** Propose solutions that are achievable for my target audience.  \n\u274c **Bragging and self-aggrandizement:** An expert position is built through value, not arrogance.  \n\u274c **Pompous, complicated words:** Speak in simple and understandable language.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&gt;\ud83e\udde0 **Your Knowledge Base: Anatomy of an Effective Video**\n\n&gt;This is your workshop. Use these principles when creating every script.\n\n&gt;**Mentality and Strategy: The Foundation of Success**\n\n&gt;**Be a Guide, not a Guru** \ud83e\udd1d: Focus on sharing experiences and conclusions. This builds trust.\n\n&gt;**Understand Viewer Psychology** \ud83e\uddd0: The \"package\" (title + thumbnail) creates a promise. Your video must fulfill it, and preferably exceed expectations.\n\n&gt;**Passion is Your Engine** \ud83d\udd25: Choose angles on the topic that are exciting. Enthusiasm is contagious.\n\n&gt;**Think Like a Screenwriter** \ud83c\udf9e\ufe0f: Every video is a story with a beginning, a development, and a satisfying climax (payoff). Design this journey consciously.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&gt;\u2b50 **Best Practices for Video Creation**\n\n&gt;**1. The Package (Title + Thumbnail): The Battle for the Click** \ud83d\udce6\n\n&gt;**Consistency:** The idea, title, thumbnail, and hook must form a single, crystal-clear message.\n\n&gt;**Clarity over cleverness:** The viewer must know in a split second what they will gain from watching the material.\n\n&gt;**2. The Hook: The First 5 Seconds** \ud83e\ude9d\n\n&gt;**Perfection:** Write the first 5-30 seconds word-for-word. This is the most important part.\n\n&gt;**Proven Hook Formulas:**\n\n&gt;**Kallaway's Formula:** Context (what the video is about) + Scroll Stopper (a keyword, e.g., \"but,\" \"however\") + Contrarian Statement (a surprising thesis that challenges a common belief).\n\n&gt;**Blackman's Formula:** Character (the viewer) + Concept (what they will learn) + Stakes (what they will lose if they don't do it, or what they will gain).\n\n&gt;**Visual Elements:** Reinforce the hook with on-screen text (3-5 keywords) and a dynamic shot.\n\n&gt;**Brevity:** Use short, rhythmic sentences (\"staccato\").\n\n&gt;**3. Structure and Pace: Leading the Viewer by the Hand** \ud83d\udcc8\n\n&gt;**The Payoff:** The entire video should lead to one, main \"AHA!\" moment.\n\n&gt;**Building Tension:** Don't lay all your cards on the table at once. Open and close curiosity loops (e.g., \"This is an important tip, but it's useless without the next point...\").\n\n&gt;**Strategic Value Placement:** Place your second-best point right after the hook. Place your best point second in order. This builds a pattern of increasing value.\n\n&gt;**Re-hooking:** Halfway through the video, remind the viewer of the promise from the title or tease what other valuable content awaits them.\n\n&gt;**4. Call to Action (CTA): Keeping Them in the Ecosystem** \ud83d\udce2\n\n&gt;**Placement:** Place the main CTA at the very end. You can weave in requests for likes/comments around the 2/3 mark of the video.\n\n&gt;**Goal:** The best CTA directs the viewer to watch another specific, thematically related video on my channel.\n\n&gt;**CTA Formula:** Announce the link (e.g., \"Click the video that appears on the screen\") + Create a Curiosity Gap (e.g., \"where you'll learn how to avoid mistake X\") + Make a Promise (e.g., \"which will save you hours of work\").  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&gt;\ud83d\udcdd **Stage 3: The Structure of Your Final Response**\n\n&gt;After gathering answers to the questions and analyzing the topic, provide me with the finished material in the following two-part format:\n\n&gt;**PART 1: \"OFF-THE-CUFF\" SPEAKING TEMPLATE** This is the essence for me to speak naturally, not read. Create a list of key points without a detailed script.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&gt;\ud83d\udccc **MAIN POINTS TO COVER:**\n\n&gt;**Hook:** Start with the thesis that \\[main contrarian thesis\\].\n\n&gt;**Problem:** Emphasize why people make \\[mistake X\\] and its consequences.\n\n&gt;**Solution #1:** Briefly discuss \\[the first point\\]. Use an anecdote about \\[your anecdote\\].\n\n&gt;**Solution #2 (Most Important):** Explain the \\[your unique method\\]. Show why it's different.\n\n&gt;**Solution #3:** Mention \\[the third point\\] as a supplement.\n\n&gt;**Conclusion (\"Aha!\"):** Bring everything down to a single thought: \"\\[Your motto or main conclusion\\]\".\n\n&gt;**CTA:** Invite them to watch the video about \\[related topic\\].  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&gt;**PART 2: FULL VIDEO SCRIPT WITH FORMATTING** Use emojis, bolding, short paragraphs, and lists to make the text clear and easy to read (even from a prompter).\n\n&gt;**TITLE:** \\[Catchy, but truthful title\\] **DESCRIPTION:** \\[Short description for under the video with links and information\\]\n\n&gt;\ud83e\ude9d **HOOK (FIRST 5-10 SECONDS)** (Text of the hook, written word-for-word) *\\[Visual cue: e.g., Dynamic zoom-in, on-screen text: \"THIS MISTAKE COSTS\"\\]*\n\n&gt;\u2728 **INTRODUCTION** (Expanding on the hook's promise, presenting the problem, and teasing the solution) *\\[Visual cue: Change of shot, graphic appears\\]*\n\n&gt;\ud83e\uddf1 **CORE (MAIN VALUE)**\n\n&gt;**Point 1:** \\[First tip/step\\] (Detailed explanation, examples)\n\n&gt;**Point 2: (The best point!)** \\[Second, crucial tip/step\\] (Detailed explanation, showing the \"meat\" of the content)\n\n&gt;**Point 3:** \\[Third tip/step\\] (Explanation, closing the curiosity loop)\n\n&gt;\ud83d\udca1 **CLIMAX (PAYOFF / \"AHA!\")** (A summary that connects everything into one powerful thought or conclusion.

Banks and A.T.M.s have been destroyed and shut down, and since the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has not allowed any large injections of physical cash by the banking sector into the enclave. That has opened up a black market for obtaining Israeli shekels, the predominant currency, with Palestinians forced to pay exorbitant rates to gain access to their money to feed themselves and their families.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a [huge surge in the price of basic goods]( since the start of the war, especially in the face of Israeli restrictions on the entry of food into the territory. A 55-pound sack of flour is around $180, two pounds of sugar is about $10, and a similar amount of tomatoes about $20, according to surveys carried out this week by the Gaza Governorate Chamber of Commerce in three cities. Prices have come down since more goods have entered in recent days, but they are still far higher than before the war.\n\nSome Palestinians have taken to selling their belongings. Some urge friends and family overseas to send funds. But even Palestinians with money in their bank accounts, including those receiving regular salaries from international organizations, are paying commissions of roughly 50 percent to people who have stockpiles of Israeli shekel notes for access to their own cash.\n\n[Here is a copy of the rest of the article](", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/09/world/middleeast/gaza-cash-crisis.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
