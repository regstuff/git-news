I\u2019m currently taking a Master  in computational linguistics in Germany, and even before starting, I did quite a bit of research on the field. Right away, I noticed\u2014especially here on Reddit\u2014that computational linguistics/NLP is increasingly dominated by machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, and so on. More traditional linguistic approaches, like formal semantics or formal grammars, seem to be in declining demand.\n\nMoreover, every time I check job postings, I mostly see positions for NLP engineers, AI engineers, data analysts, etc., all of which require strong programming skills, as well as expertise in machine learning and related fields. That\u2019s why I chose this university from the start\u2014it offered more courses in machine learning, mathematics, etc. And now that some courses, like NLP and ML, are more theoretical, I wanna  supplement my knowledge with more hands-on practice, like  Udemy courses or similar.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the thing, in my college, many of my classmates with humanities/linguistics backgrounds are not concerned with that and they always argue that it\u2019s not our role to become NLP engineers or expert programmers. \nThey claim that there are plenty of positions specifically for computational linguists, where programming and machine learning are just useful extras but not essential skills. So, they\u2019re shaping their study plans in a more theoretical direction\u2014choosing courses like formal semantics instead of more advanced classes in ML, advanced NLP etc... They don\u2019t seem particularly concerned about building a strong foundation in programming, ML or mathematics either, because \u201cwe will work with computer scientists and engineers that do that, not us\u201d.\n\nWhile, I don\u2019t know, for me it\u2019s very important to have a good knowledge in these areas, because I think that even tho we will never have the same background of a computer scientist, we are supposed to have these skills and knowledge if we wanna be competitive outside of academia.\n\nWhen I talk with them I feel like they\u2019re a bit out of touch with reality and haven\u2019t really  looked at  the current job market. As I mentioned, when I look at t job postings I don\u2019t see all these \u201ccomputational linguistics\u201d positions as they say and the few less technical roles I see are typically annotation jobs, which are lower-paid but also require far fewer qualifications\u2014often, a basic degree in theoretical linguistics is more than enough for those positions.\n\nI mean maybe I\u2019m wrong about this and I\u2019d rather be wrong in this case, but I\u2019m not that positive", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1iw6d5s/are_my_colleagues_out_of_touch_with_the_job/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "63% of Ukrainians approve of Zelensky as president, poll shows", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/63-of-ukrainians-approve-zelensky-as-president-poll-shows/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Linux voice Containers", "summary": "I have been thinking about the nature of voice frameworks that seem to be in various forms of branded voice assitants that seem to contain little innovation just refactoring to create alternatives to the big 3 of Google, Amazon &amp; Apple.  \nThen there are speech toolkits that have much innovation and development that is original.  \nAll do compete in the same space and its unlikely any one will contain the bestof for all the stages in a voice pipeline.\n\nOpensource and Linux seems to be missing a flexible method to be able to pick and choose the modules required and assemble in what is mostly a serial chain of voice processing.  \nWe need something like Linux Voice Containers to partition system dependencies and link at the network level. I think that part could just reuses the same concurrent client/server websockets server, to move a text file of meta/data pairs likely json and binary files/streams, due to its 2 distinct packet types that are conveniently text &amp; binary.  \nLVC should be shared containers with a multiple client input websockets server to accept file data and binary audio, to drop as files, standard ALSA or stdin processes.\n\nIt would be really beneficial if branding could be dropped and collaboration amongst frameworks to create Linux Voice containers that are protocol and branding free.  \nThat a single common container with both a client and server can be linked in repetive chans to provide the common voice pipeline steps of.  \nZonal KWS, Microphones initial audio processing -&gt; ASR -&gt; Multimodal Skill Router -&gt; Skill Server -&gt; Zonal Audio out.  \nThat each client output can route to the next free stage or queue the current request and be a simple chain or complex routing system for high user concurency.\n\nIf the major frameworks could work together to create simple lowest common denominator container building blocks in a standardised form of Linux Voice Containers using standard linux methods and protocols such as websockets those frameworks might be less prone to plaguarism of refactoring and rebranding and presenting as own as all they have done is link various systems together to create an ownbrand voice assistant.  \nThere are some great frameworks that actually innovate and develop such as\u00a0[Wenet](\u00a0[ESPnet](\u00a0and\u00a0[SpeechBrain](\u00a0and apols if your missed from the list but just examples, but if all could contribute to a non branded form of voice pipeline that IMO should be something like LVC but what ever the collaborative conclusion should be.  \nIt should be a collaborative process of as many parties as possible and not just some mechanism to create false claims that your own proprietary methods are in someway opensource standards!\n\nIf you don't provide easy building block systems for linking together a voice pipeline then its very likely someone else will and simply refactor and rebrand the modules at each stage.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1iw07mx/linux_voice_containers/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adani power plans to develop 30 GW nuclear capacity", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/adani-power-plans-to-develop-30-gw-nuclear-capacity/articleshow/118461064.cms?", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UPDATE: Tool Calling with DeepSeek-R1 671B with LangChain and LangGraph", "summary": "I posted about a Github repo I created last week on tool calling with DeepSeek-R1 671B with LangChain and LangGraph, or more generally for any LLMs available in LangChain\u2019s ChatOpenAI class (particularly useful for newly released LLMs which isn\u2019t supported for tool calling yet by LangChain and LangGraph).\n\n\n\nThis repo just got an upgrade.
