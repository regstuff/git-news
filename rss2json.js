He mentioned using this with Docker and I had always steered clear of Docker since I could never get it installed on my machine. Then I learned about Gemini CLI.\n\nGemini CLI is great for about 1 hour, then it heavily limits itself. But, I was able to get Gemini CLI to install Docker for me and make a container with Open Webui, all with one command. Then I watched as it happened. Finally, I was able to have Docker and a setup that mimics ChatGPT sorta, imo. \n\nNow, I love it. I spent all night learning how to get models into Open Webui, customizing the interface some (still having issues here), and getting it to work for assistant, chat, music, and work needs, in that order of prioritization. Ha. So, being able to use this, technically, as a 1-click install, is possible. Getting it going the way you need does require some digging but I enjoy that part. \n\nOne thing that is bugging me is the lack of resources I can find for customizing it. I don't want to do much to it, but I have some personal visual issues that needs some assistance. I would like to figure out how the fonts can be changed, the color of the font can be changed, and change the color of the backgrounds. I see that it appears to be possible to do so.

Tried a bunch of reminder apps but honestly couldn't be bothered to actually use them.\n\nThen I had this dumb/brilliant idea - what if I could just BCC myself with a time delay? Like when I'm emailing someone, just add mailto:myself[\\+3d@gmail.com](mailto:+3d@gmail.com) to BCC and get the email back in 3 days?\n\nTurns out Gmail (and most email providers) have this \"plus addressing\" thing where anything after the + still goes to your inbox. So I built a little service that:\n\n* Watches your inbox for these special addresses\n* Sends you back your original email at the right time\n* Works with stuff like +2h (2 hours), +7d (7 days), +1w (1 week)\n* Also works with other services than Gmail, I personally use it on my own custom mail server\n\nBeen using it for months and it's honestly been a game changer. No more \"oh shit I forgot to follow up\" moments.\n\nJust made some huge updates and open-sourced it in case anyone else has the same problem. It runs on your own server so your emails stay private. Also added a bunch of languages because why not.\n\nGitHub: [\n\nNot trying to make this a big thing, just thought someone might find it useful!", "link": "https://github.com/mariusangelmann/Wiedervorlage", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Model Context Protocol (MCP) for beginners tutorials (53 tutorials)", "summary": "This playlist comprises of numerous tutorials on MCP servers including\n\n1.

The Free TPU also has a whipping 334GB of memory to work with, and 255GB of system storage. Meaning with Unsloth, we could fine-tune models like Qwen3 235B at 4-bit, or even run models like DeepSeek-R1 at Q3, or train them if Unsloth ever supports 3-bit loading, all for free.\n\n# The Implementation\n\nYou would use a library such as Pallas, which is meant to enable custom kernel development on TPUs if the ecosystem is PyTorch or JAX, and Unsloth uses PyTorch as part of HF Transformers / Diffusers, and TRL Trainer.\n\n# Why?\n\nThe benefits are immense. More people can explore fine-tuning or even efficient inference using Unsloth's kernel development, and TPUs are generally faster than GPUs for deep-learning tasks.\n\n# Summary\n\nTPUs would be an amazing addition to Unsloth for more broad fine-tuning, especially since Unsloth defaults to using platforms with TPU access, which are Google Colab and Kaggle.\n\n## I really hope this gets worked on!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1lnz5ua/idea_allow_tpu_fine_tuning/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "offline-first code snippet manager", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/ddoemonn/patchwork", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine withdraws from anti-personnel mines ban treaty, says Zelenskyy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/29/ukraine-to-withdraw-from-anti-personnel-mines-ban-treaty-says-zelenskyy", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Very Fast Dictation: Private real-time dictation app for Mac", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/aviaryan/Very-Fast-Dictation", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I Built a 20-Pillar Method to Context Engineer Apps (Choose From 200 Functions)", "summary": "Have an app idea but need the complete feature roadmap?

Think: prompt that forces insight \u2192 introspection \u2192 method refinement \u2192 flaw injection \u2192 repair. Rinse and repeat.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n* Shifts AI behavior from single-shot\u2014to recursive, self-correcting reasoning.\n* Makes \u201clearning\u201d visible within session, without fine-tuning or memory.\n* Forces balance: creativity *plus* grounding, avoiding echo chambers.\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 Prompt Template (use as-is):\n\nYou are about to engage in recursive intelligence amplification.\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: Offer one original insight about intelligence, learning, or self\u2011improvement.\n\nSTEP 2: Reflect on how that insight challenges or contradicts your prior reasoning.\n\nSTEP 3: Use that reflection to \\*hack\\* your own insight-generation process.\n\nSTEP 4: Inject one intentional flaw in your output.\n\nSTEP 5: Analyze the flaw's impact \u2013 how it corrupts or biases future reasoning.\n\nSTEP 6: Propose a repair heuristic that would ground or stabilize the insight.\n\n\n\nConstraints:\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t modify this prompt in any cycle.\n\n\u2013 Each cycle must expose a \\*new\\* structural vulnerability.\n\n  \n**Example Demo:**  \n*(Summarize a single cycle or two here\u2014e.g., insight about error/failure, self-critique, flaw injection, repair heuristic)*\n\n**Try it out:**\n\n* Try this prompt with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.\n* Share your *Cycle 1 output* and subsequent cycles.\n* What patterns emerge? Where does it converge, diverge, or spiral?\n* Does it actually feel like the AI \u201clearned\u201d?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lo42s6/recursive_intelligence_amplification_prompt_make/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
