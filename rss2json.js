He \u201creassured\u201d the president that \u201cthere is no threat on our western border\u201d.\n\nOn 27 December, Poland celebrates the anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater Poland Uprising in 1918. In 2021, under the rule of the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government and PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda, the day was\u00a0[made an official national holiday](\n\nThe uprising took place in the wake of World War One, as Poland sought to re-establish itself as an independent state following over a century of\u00a0[partition between Germany, Russia and Austria](\n\nIt broke out in the Greater Poland region, which had been under German rule. By mid-January 1919, Polish forces had taken control of most of the province, and in June it was recognised as part of the newly independent Poland in the Treaty of Versailles. Around 2,300 people died in the uprising.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday at an event in the city of Pozna\u0144 to mark the anniversary, Nawrocki hailed the Greater Poland insurgents for \u201cgiving us an example of how we can triumph\u201d.\n\nPoland is a \u201cnational community open to the west, but also a national community ready to defend the western border of the republic, as the Greater Poland insurgents knew\u201d, continued the president, who was elected this year with the support of PiS, which is now Poland\u2019s main opposition party.\n\nNawrocki also recalled how Poles had lived under \u201csevere German imperialism\u201d during the partitions, when \u201caggressive\u201d efforts were made to \u201ctake away our culture and national heritage\u201d.\n\nJust as Poles back then took action to defend their national identity, so today \u201cwe must do everything we can to ensure that Poland remains Poland\u201d, added the president.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s speech was met with a response today from Sikorski, who is part of a government that enjoys\u00a0[friendly relations with Berlin](\n\n\u201cI wish to reassure the president that, as long as Germany is in NATO and the EU, and is governed by Christians or social democrats, there is no threat to our western border,\u201d wrote the foreign minister on social media.\n\nHe added that a threat \u201ccould only arise if power beyond the Oder \\[river that marks the border\\] were taken by Europhobic nationalists\u201d. That \u201craises an obvious question for our nationalists: do you really want Germany to become like you?\u201d\n\nPiS has long presented Germany as a threat to Poland. In 2023, the party\u2019s leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski,\u00a0[warned](\u00a0that the European Union is seeking to introduce a \u201cGerman plan\u201d that would result in \u201cthe annihilation of the Polish state\u201d.\n\nThey also accuse the current government of being complicit in executing that plan. Last year, Kaczy\u0144ski\u00a0[said](\u00a0that Prime Minister Donald Tusk is leading a \u201cpacification operation\u201d designed to destroy Poland\u2019s sovereignty and \u201cturn us into farmhands for people from Western Europe, especially Germany\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Germany\u2019s main opposition, has at times used anti-Polish rhetoric. Last month, one of its co-leaders, Tino Chrupalla,\u00a0[said](\u00a0that Poland is as much of a threat to Germany as is Russia.\n\nIn recent years, there have been particular tensions over the Polish-German bobrder, especially Germany\u2019s policy of\u00a0[sending thousands of migrants back to Poland](\u00a0who have crossed illegally.\n\nThat prompted the\u00a0[formation](\u00a0of so-called \u201ccitizen patrols\u201d, many of them linked to or supported by PiS, who sought to defend the border from migrant transfers.
