In this case, however, a doctoral student at the University of Warsaw and editor of Archeowie\u015bci will tell the story of a particular area of western Mexico where, more than six centuries ago, cremation was the main funeral rite for at least a part of the Indigenous community. Burials associated with the local community of this region were recently discovered in the Middle Balsas River valley, which constitutes the border between the states of Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero. Traces of these funerary practices are the subject of a remarkably important study conducted by the author in collaboration with researchers from the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia Michoac\u00e1n and Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, under the direction of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Luis Punzo D\u00edaz.", "link": "https://archeowiesci.pl/en/fire-walk-with-me-cremation-burial-practices-in-tierra-caliente-michoacan/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In 2004, Gayle Laverne Grinds passed away in the hospital after surgeons spent six exhausting hours trying to separate her skin from a couch to which it had fused after she had spent six years sitting on it.", "summary": "", "link": "https://historicflix.com/the-tragic-tale-of-gayle-grinds/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ContextCheck: An open-source framework for testing and evaluating LLMs, RAGs, Chatbots", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Addepto/contextcheck", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Amazon's ambitious AI upgrade for Alexa is struggling with significant technical issues, according to internal documents.
