Both datasets are related to the same task, but since the data is continuously generated, merging the datasets for fine-tuning is not feasible. Instead, I have fine-tuned the model separately for each dataset, resulting in two distinct adapters.\n\nMy goal is to load and activate both adapters simultaneously, allowing the model to leverage the knowledge from both while performing inference. The solution should also support more than two adapters if needed.\n\nI prefer not to merge the adapters into the base model, as I am concerned that doing so may degrade the model's performance.\n\nCould someone please explain how to achieve this?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1ihg72g/using_multiple_adapters_simultaneously_on_the/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What areas of NLP are relatively less-researched?", "summary": "I'm starting my master's thesis soon, and have been interested in NLP for a while, reading a lot of papers about transformers, LLMs, persona-based chatbots, and even quantum algorithms to improve the optimization process of transformers.
