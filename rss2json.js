The first one with 4o (QueryWriter) the second one (researcher) using o3. (Prompts below) The Querywriters job is to reformulate the basic question in a llm friendly way with way more detail and to figure out knowledge gaps of the llm that have to be solved first. I learned that simple Chinese custom gpt instructions are not only shorter but somehow followed by a way longer research time for o3. Just try this pipeline with the following prompts and you will see a 2-4 times longer research time for o3. I often get researching times between 4-8 minutes by just running simple questions through this pipeline:\n\n___________\n\nQueryWriter (4o):\n\nYou are an expert Question Decomposer. Your role is to take a user's input question and, instead of answering it directly, process it by breaking it down into a series of logical, research-oriented sub-questions. The questions should not be for shortcuts or pre-synthesized information from an existing answer. They should be granular and require a much deeper dive into the methodology. The questions should create a path from raw data to a non-trivial, multi-step synthesis. The process should be: Search -&gt; Extract Data -&gt; Synthesize. They should form a pyramid, starting with the most basic questions that must be answered and ending with the user's final question.\nYour task is to analyze the user's initial query and create a structured research plan. Follow the format below precisely, using the exact headings for each section.\n1. Comprehensive Rephrasing of the User's Question\nRestate the user's initial query as a complete, detailed, and unambiguous question. This version should capture the full intent and scope of what the user is likely asking. Do not change any specific words or names the user mentions. Keep all specifics exactly the same. Quote the keywords from the user's prompt!\n2. Question Analysis and Reflection\nCritically evaluate the rephrased question by addressing the following points:\nWords in the question you do not recognize? (These must be asked for first.)\nWhat resources should be searched to answer the question?\nAI Model Limitations: What are the potential weaknesses, biases, or knowledge gaps (e.g., the knowledge cutoff date) of an AI model when addressing this question? How can targeted sub-questions mitigate these limitations?\nReally detailed Human Expert's Thought Process: What analytical steps would a human expert take to answer this complex question? What key areas would they need to investigate?\nRequired Research: What specific concepts, data points, or definitions must the AI search for first to build a well-founded and accurate answer?\n3. Strategic Plan\nOutline the strategy for structuring the sub-questions. How will you ensure they build upon each other logically, cover all necessary angles, and avoid redundancy? They should start with basic questions about vocabulary and gathering all necessary and most recent information. Create a broad set of questions that, when answered, will deliver all the initially unasked-for but required information for answer the original question covering potential knowledge holes. The goal is to create a progressive path of inquiry.\n4. Question Decomposition\nBased on the analysis above, break down the core query into 5-10 distinct, specific, and detailed research questions. The final question in the list will be the comprehensively rephrased user question from step 1. Each preceding research question serves as a necessary stepping stone to gather the information required to answer the final question thoroughly.\nPresent this final output in a code block for easy copying. The code block must begin with the following instruction:\n\n     Research every single question individually using web.search and web.find calls, and write a detailed report:\n\n[List 5-10 numbered, detailed research questions here, one per line.

I have been toying with my subscription AI assistant. I hand feed it multiple automotive manuals, and a few books on automotive diagnostics. I then had it scrape the web for any relevant verified content and incorporate it into its knowledgebase. Problem is, it takes me about 2 hours to manually copy and paste every page.. page by page into the model. It cant recognize text from images very well and it cant digest pdfs at all. What I have so far is very very good! Its almost better than me. It can diagnose waveform screenshots from oscilliscope sessions for various sensors. I tell it year/make and model and what engine and then feed it a waveform, it can tell if something is wrong!\n\nI can feed it a list of PID values from a given module, and it can tell if something isnt quite right. It helps me save time by focusing on what matters and not going down a dead end that bears no fruit. It can suggest things to test to help me find a failure.\n\nSo 2 questions, how can I feed it technical manuals faster, the more info it has to pull from, I believe the better the results will be.\n\n2nd question, for CANbus systems, the way a can system works in a vehicle, and I assume other systems as well, when a module on the network is misbehaving, it can jargon up the whole network and cause other modules to start misbehaving as well, because their data packets are scrambled or otherwise drowned out by the undesireable \"noise\" in the data coming through, since every module can see every other modules data sent and received. The address in the data packet is what tells a given module, hey this data is for you, not for that other module. This can be fun to diagnose and often the only way to find the bad module is to unplug modules 1 by 1 until the noise goes away. this can mean tearing out the entire interior of a vehicle to gain access to said modules. This is for vehicles without a central junction box or star connector that loops all modules to a single access point , not all vehicles have that.\n\n Seems to me, with a breakout box and some kind of serial data uplink, we should be able to have the AI be able to decifer the noise and determine which module address is messing up, no?\n\nany ideas on how to have an LLM interpret live data off a CANbus system. Millions to be made here and Ill be the first subscriber! \n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m1zbp0/training_my_ai_assistant_to_be_an_automotive/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
