Everything felt magical.\n\nBut after three months, I found myself frustrated. My productivity wasn\u2019t improving as much as I expected. Some outputs felt bland or even useless. Eventually, I realized something important:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Using AI poorly is worse than not using it at all.\n\nHere are a few lessons I\u2019ve learned the hard way \u2014 hopefully they\u2019ll save you some time.\n\n# 1. Not knowing what you want in the first place\n\nI used to treat AI like a magic genie. Ask it anything, see what happens.\n\nBut AI can\u2019t define your problem for you. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for, AI won\u2019t magically figure it out.\n\nI once asked, \u201cHow can I be more productive?\u201d Sure, it gave me a long list of suggestions \u2014 most of which I already knew. The issue wasn\u2019t knowledge; it was clarity.\n\nPro tip: Get clear on your actual problem. Then use AI as a helper, not a mind-reader.\n\n# 2. Assuming AI will do all the work\n\nWe tend to think the smarter the tool, the less effort we need to put in.\n\nBut that\u2019s backwards. AI is only as good as your input.\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT to \u201cwrite a resume,\u201d it gave me a generic, boring version. But when I provided specific job titles, personal experiences, and desired tone, the result was 10x better.\n\n&gt;\n\n# 3. Weak prompts = weak results\n\nThis was my biggest realization.\n\nI started off talking to AI like I would talk to a friend. Naturally, the responses were vague and kind of useless.\n\nEventually I learned that prompts are everything.\n\nFor example:\n\n* \u274c \u201cWrite some slides for me.\u201d\n* \u2705 \u201cYou\u2019re a marketing expert with 10 years of experience. Help me create a 10-slide presentation about brand positioning. Each slide should have one key sentence and three bullet points.\u201d\n\n# 4. Too many tools, too much context switching\n\nI tried using ChatGPT for copywriting, Notion AI for note-taking, Midjourney for visuals, and a bunch of project management tools like Trello and Slack\u2026\n\nIn the end, I was spending more time switching between tools than actually working.\n\nNow I stick to just a few essential tools, and I reuse structured prompts or templates to keep things consistent.\n\n# Final thoughts:\n\nAI is not a magic wand. It\u2019s a mirror \u2014 it reflects the clarity and structure you give it.\n\nInstead of hoping for smarter tools, start by being a smarter user.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1loqr5i/using_ai_poorly_is_worse_than_not_using_it_at_all/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump Says He Doesn\u2019t Expect to Extend July 9 Tariff Deadline - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-29/trump-says-he-doesn-t-expect-to-extend-july-9-tariff-deadline", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
