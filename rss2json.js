Contextual Creativity Framing (CCF).**\n\nMost people try to make AI creative by simply saying \"be creative\" or \"think outside the box.\" But that's like trying to start a car without fuel.\n\n**Here's the CCF pattern that actually works:** \n\nBefore generating your response, follow this creativity protocol:\n\n\n\n1. CONTEXTUALIZE: What makes this request unique or challenging?\n\n2. DIVERGE: Generate 5 completely different approaches (label them A-E)\n\n3. CROSS-POLLINATE: Combine elements from approaches A+C, B+D, and C+E\n\n4. AMPLIFY: Take the most unconventional idea and make it 2x bolder\n\n5. ANCHOR: Ground your final answer in a real-world example\n\n\n\nNow answer: \\[YOUR QUESTION HERE\\]\n\n**Real-world example:**\n\n**Normal prompt:** \"Write a marketing slogan for a coffee brand\"\n\n**Typical AI response:** \"Wake up to greatness with BrewMaster Coffee\"\n\n**With CCF:**\n\n\"Before generating your response, follow this creativity protocol:\n\n1. CONTEXTUALIZE: Coffee is oversaturated but morning energy is universal\n2. DIVERGE: A) Time travel theme B) Plant growth metaphor C) Industrial revolution energy D) Community gathering focus E) Sensory experience journey\n3. CROSS-POLLINATE: B+D = \"Grow your community, one bean at a time\"\n4. AMPLIFY: \"Cultivate connections that bloom into tomorrow\"\n5. ANCHOR: Like how local coffee shops became the third place between home and work\n\nFinal slogan: \"Cultivate connections that bloom into tomorrow \u2013 just like your local barista remembers your order before you even ask.\"\n\n**The results are staggering:**\n\n* 340% more unique word combinations\n* 280% higher user engagement in testing\n* 420% more memorable responses in recall tests\n* Works consistently across GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini Pro, and Grok\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nThe human brain naturally uses divergent-convergent thinking cycles. CCF forces AI to mimic this neurological pattern, resulting in genuinely novel connections rather than recombined training data.\n\n**Try this with your next creative task and prepare to be amazed.**\n\n**Pro tip:** Customize the 5 steps for your domain:\n\n* For storytelling: CHARACTERIZE \u2192 EXPLORE \u2192 CONNECT \u2192 NARRATE \u2192 POLISH\n* For problem-solving: DEFINE \u2192 DIVERGE \u2192 EVALUATE \u2192 SYNTHESIZE \u2192 VALIDATE\n* For ideation: QUESTION \u2192 IMAGINE \u2192 COMBINE \u2192 STRETCH \u2192 REALIZE\n\nWhat creative challenge are you stuck on?

Your goal is to help me, an investor, understand the current market environment and analyze a potential investment. If there is something you are unable to complete do not fake it. Skip the task and let me know that you skipped it.\n\n\n\n**Part 1: Market &amp; Macro-Economic Overview** Identify and summarize the top 5 major economic or market-moving themes that have been widely reported by reputable financial news sources (e.g., Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, Reuters) over the following periods:\n\n* This week (as of today, August 12, 2025)\n* This month (August 2025)\n* This year (2025 YTD)\n\nFor each theme, briefly explain its potential impact on the market and list a few sectors that are commonly cited as being positively or negatively affected.\n\n**Part 2: Initial Analysis**\n\nThe following must be found within the previously realized sectors impacted positively\u2026\n\n1. Filter for Liquidity: Screen for stocks with an Average Daily Volume greater than 500,000 shares. This ensures you can enter and exit trades without significant slippage.\n2. Filter for Volatility: Look for stocks with an Average True Range (ATR) that is high enough to offer a potential profit but not so high that the risk is unmanageable. This often correlates with a Beta greater than 1.\n3. Filter for a Trend: Use a Moving Average (MA) filter to identify stocks that are already in motion. A common filter is to screen for stocks where the current price is above the 50-day Moving Average (MA). This quickly eliminates stocks in a downtrend.\n4. Identify Support &amp; Resistance: The first step is to visually mark key Support and Resistance levels. These are the \"rules of the road\" for the stock's price action.\n5. Check the RSI: Look at the Relative Strength Index (RSI). For a potential long trade, you want the RSI to be above 50, indicating bullish momentum. For a short trade, you'd look for the opposite.\n6. Use a Moving Average Crossover: Wait for a bullish signal. A common one is when a shorter-term moving average (e.g., the 20-day EMA) crosses above a longer-term one (e.g., the 50-day SMA).\n7. Confirm with Volume: A strong signal is confirmed when the price moves on above-average volume. This suggests that institutional money is moving into the stock.\n\n\n\n**Part 3: Final Analysis**\n\n**Technical Entry/Exit Point Determination:**\n\n* Once you've identified a fundamentally strong and quantitatively attractive company, switch to **technical analysis** to determine the optimal timing for your trade.\n* **Identify the Trend:** Confirm the stock is in a clear **uptrend** on longer-term charts (e.g., weekly, monthly).\n* **Look for Pullbacks to Support:** Wait for the stock's price to pull back to a significant **support level** (e.g., a major moving average like the 50-day or 200-day MA, or a previous resistance level that has turned into support).\n* **Confirm with Momentum Indicators:** Use indicators like **RSI** or **MACD** to confirm that the stock is not overbought at your desired entry point, or that a bullish divergence is forming.\n* **Volume Confirmation:** Look for increasing **volume** on price increases and decreasing volume on pullbacks, which can confirm the strength of the trend.\n* **Set Your Stop-Loss:** Place your stop-loss order just below a key support level for a long trade, or just above a key resistance level for a short trade. This protects your capital if the trade goes against you.\n* **Set Your Take-Profit:** Set your take-profit order at the next major resistance level for a long trade, or the next major support level for a short trade. A typical risk-to-reward ratio for a swing trade is at least 1:2 or 1:3.\n\n  \n  \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mok7p0/ive_been_testing_prompts_for_stock/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Octavia Spencer paid for Power star to get a publicist when he was $20K in debt: 'Didn't ask for the money back'", "summary": "", "link": "https://ew.com/octavia-spencer-paid-for-power-star-to-get-publicist-11789768", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan Army Chief Warns It Will Counter Any India Aggression", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-11/pakistan-army-chief-warns-it-will-counter-any-india-aggression", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Some GRPO questions", "summary": "Thank so much for the great fine-tuning tool, especially for memory saving.\n\nI have been testing GRPO with qwen3.
