I dont think there is a quick and easy answer but i thought i may as well ask the experts.\n\nIn public sector research there's often massive spreadsheets with proper nouns taking up one of the columns. These are usually public entities, companies, or people. Much of the time these are free text entries.\n\nThis means for proper analysis one needs to standardise. Whilst fuzzy matching can take you some of the way, its not specifically for this kind of use case and has limitations. It cant deal with abbreviations, often different sequences of words etc.\n\nbrute forcing with llms is one way, the most thorough approach I think ive got to is something like:\n\n1. cleaning low value but common words\n2. fingerprint\n3. levenshtein\n4. soundex\n\nbut this seems so messy!

I want to attend a university with a good archaeology program to avoid being stuck digging up arrowheads for 50k USD a year. So far I know that: you want a university with enough archaeologists on staff to get you connections, a program with field opportunities and lots of different courses for methods (maritime, classical, etc.). \n\nIn the US, as far as I'm concerned, given my B+ average, lack of too much extracurricular activities, and \\~1300 SAT score, there are not any colleges I can get into that are worth paying 80k to attend because they only have an 'alright' archaeology program. That said, I am very interested in the European colleges, barring my discovery of an on par college in the US that fits my criteria.\n\nI am looking at specifically Universitet Uppsala, as I have family in Sweden, though they are quite a distance from Uppsala, and it has an 80% acceptance rate, 12k USD estimate yearly total including housing and 6k USD tuition. The primary issue is that I know very minimal Swedish, and all classes not Bachelors or Masters are in Swedish. I also want a social life at the university, and from what I understand, Uppsala is a college town.\n\nBut I have also seen the Sapienza University of Rome, which I somewhat think I can get into, and seems to have the same benefits and problems (language barrier). I haven't done too much research into this university specifically.\n\nAll this is additionally hampered by my significant lack of understanding how domestic and international universities function.\n\nSo I am asking 2 things: \n\n1, are there any universities you think I have a chance of getting into in the US that are close to or on par with the 2 European ones, that don't have a destructively high tuition, and,\n\n 2, are the two universities I named in Europe worth considering, or are there better ones in Europe with acceptance rates I can get into, and also, within that: do I actually need to know Swedish that proficiently to attend Uppsala, or Italian for Sapienza? Any universities in England or Ireland I can get into without again being stuck in the US looking at my 5th arrowhead of the day?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1h1l1dz/where_to_attend_college_for_archaeology/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yorkshire woman wakes from coma unable to speak - then sings entire Adele song", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/yorkshire-woman-wakes-coma-unable-30465166?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=reddit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine\u2019s warriors brace for a Kremlin surge in the south", "summary": "", "link": "https://archive.ph/23i9f", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hamas Says 'Ready' For Gaza Truce After Lebanon Ceasefire", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.barrons.com/news/hamas-says-ready-for-gaza-truce-after-lebanon-ceasefire-6d7a8846", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pipelight - Manage git-hooks without the bloat ", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/pipelight/pipelight", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Smog hits India and Pakistan: Here's why", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PAKISTAN-POLLUTION/znpnljqdbpl/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "On January 19, 1981, Muhammad Ali, the heavyweight champion, was shocked to hear that a Vietnam veteran was about to end his life near his home.
