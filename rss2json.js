The problem with this is that it seems impossible to get a job in the field without some sort of formal education in CS. Fortunately, though, I have taken online courses in Python and CS (CS50 courses) and am breezing through my Python for Text Processing course this semester because of it. I also do have a strong suit for math, so courses in that would not be a concern for me pursuing another degree.\n\nI would love to get another degree in any program that would set me up for a career, though funding is another massive issue here. As of now, it seems that the jobs I would qualify for now with just the BA in Ling are all low-paying (teaching ESL mainly), meaning I would struggle to pay for an expensive masters program. Because of this, these are the current options I have been considering, and I would appreciate insight from anyone with relevant or similar experience:\n\n1. Pursue a linguistics masters degree with a concentration in CL from the university I currently attend.\n   1. This would be likely the cheapest option for a MS, but seemingly is going to be much more Ling than CS, and would not cover a lot of the seemingly very important math content that I understand is very important.\n2. Pursue an masters in CL from another university.\n   1. From what I have seen, these are all almost double the cost of the first option, but are much closer to CS and often have 'make-up' courses for those who are not as familiar in CS.\n3. Pursue a second Bachelor's in CS.\n   1. This would likely be difficult since there seems to be even less funding for second Bachelor's than for masters degrees.\n4. Get a job unrelated for now, until I save up enough to afford one of these programs, while perhaps taking cheap courses via community college or online.\n   1. I really do not want to do this, as much of what I'm qualified for currently are not fields I am particularly passionate or excited about entering.\n\nMy questions for you all are:\n\nHave any of you been in a similar position? I often see people mention that they came from Linguistics and pivoted, but I don't actually understand how that process works, how people fund it, or which of programs I know of are actually reasonable for my circumstances.\n\nI have seen that people claim you should just try to get a job in the industry, but how is that possible when you have no work experience in programming?\n\nWould another Linguistics degree with just a *concentration* in CL be enough to actually get me jobs, or is that unrealistic?\n\nHow the HELL do people fund their master's programs to level up their income when their initial career pays much lower?? One of my biggest concerns about working elsewhere first is that I'll never be able to fund my higher education if I do wait instead of just taking loans and making more money sooner.\n\nI don't expect anyone to provide me with a life plan or anything, but any insight you have on these things would really help since it feels like I've already messed up by getting a Linguistics degree.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1gbgo5g/post_bachelors_planning/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is a Linguistics major, CS minor, and Stats minor enough to get into a CL/NLP masters program?", "summary": "Obviously a CS major would be ideal, but since I'm a first year applying out of stream, there is a good chance I won't get into the CS major program.

The meeting has raised hopes of stabilizing India-China relations following the 2020 border tensions. The disengagement agreement announced this week is seen as a positive step towards restoring peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). However, the absence of a joint statement suggests ongoing differences between the two countries. While China emphasizes the need for economic normalization, India remains focused on securing the border first.\n\nThe recent BRICS summit also marked the admission of new members \u2014 Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE. This expansion reflects the bloc's ambition to counter Western influence and promote a multipolar world order, but challenges remain due to internal imbalances, particularly with China's dominant economic position.\n\nThe broader geopolitical landscape also remains in flux, with both Modi and Xi keeping an eye on the upcoming U.S. elections and their potential impact on global politics.\n\n", "link": "https://i.redd.it/qfhs1hdoruwd1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Argentina: An example in economic diplomacy", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/india-argentina-an-example-in-economic-diplomacy", "author": "None"}, {"title": "This Normal Trove of Coin is the Most Valuable Treasure Ever Found in Britain", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/an-astonishing-trove-of-coins-dating-to-the-norman-conquest-just-became-the-most-valuable-treasure-ever-found-in-britain-180985313/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Career Path: Archaeologist or Archaeological Chemist?", "summary": "I'm a recent chemistry graduate from the Philippines interested in pursuing a career in archaeology.
