Currently it is doing quite well, despite there being no API available.  Though through hard work, and some unique mechanisms, I've gotten the AI to make good progress to learn the game mechanics, and structure the code in such way to guide it in an api like fashion. \n\nMy question is, would anyone be interested in working on An ai project involving Dark Souls? The scope and difficulty is huge, but I know the community has been wanting a structure for Dark souls ai gaming for a while now. I aim to supply that, in a unique and different way, one that by passes the traditional API method, and focuses heavily on the AI itself. I'd love to hear your feed back, it will influence my decision to either go open source on github or not. Either way, the code as it's stands is a breakthrough as it is and will continue to grow. With collaboration and shared skill and knowledge it would just be better that's all. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from the community. \n\nSummary:\n\n1. Technor AI is an AI that plays and trains in the Dark Souls Remastered Environment. \n\n2. It's primarily been taught the concept of \"fun\" to enhance novelty and exploration in order to become an agent that 100% Dark souls. \n\n3. Has been incorporated with several enhanced unique mechanisms for guided training to induce a API like sense of direction and structure. Dark souls has sparse rewards, so teaching without an API is challenging.  \n\n4. Looking forward to Jolly cooperation, if it's not your scene no worries, if it is, I'll answer your questions. There's also a video of a previous iteration on YouTube for reference. \n\n5. Code on github is not full deployment obviously as stated,  full deployment to be determined.  \n\nThank you.
