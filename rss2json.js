H ere are this week's\u00a0[Top 5](\u00a0ancient headlines:\n\n* [Turtles May Have Been Taken by Ancient Humans While Traveling \u2014 and Eaten as Snacks](\u00a0\u2014 Archaeologists in Germany have discovered shell fragments of European pond turtles dating from 42,000 to 50,000 years ago. These turtles thrive in warmer conditions, indicating that they were carried north by Ice Age hunters, possibly as mobile food sources during their travels. Found in a gravel pit near Magdeburg, this finding aligns with other evidence of turtle consumption across ancient human sites in Israel, South Africa, and Spain. Further research is needed to determine whether modern humans or Neanderthals were responsible for transporting these turtles.\n* [Ancient Pueblo Used Conch Shell Trumpets for Communication](\u00a0\u2014 Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that the ancient Pueblo peoples of the southwestern United States used conch shell trumpets as communication tools. These artifacts, discovered in a context suggesting ceremonial use, indicate a sophisticated network of sound-based signaling that spanned large distances, enhancing social and ritual connectivity in the region.\n* [Traces of Feasts Found at Roman Necropolis in France](\u00a0\u2014 Excavations at the Robine necropolis in Narbonne, France, dating from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE, have uncovered over 1,400 graves. This site, once part of the Roman colony Narbo Martius, revealed evidence of ceremonial feasts, with charred remains of dates, figs, cereals, and bread found in the graves. These remains are thought to have been offered through ceramic libation tubes during Feralia, a Roman festival honoring the deceased, allowing people to share feasts with those who had passed. Artifacts like banquet beds were also discovered at the site, along with grave goods like vases, jewelry, and apotropaic amulets.\n* [Archaeology Team Uncovers 7000-Year-Old Settlement in Serbia](\u00a0\u2014 In Serbia, archaeologists have discovered an unusually large 7,000-year-old Neolithic site near the village of Jarkovac. This find includes well-preserved buildings, pottery, and stone tools, offering a vivid picture of Neolithic life in the Balkans. The artifacts indicate that the site was that of the Vin\u010da culture, which is dated to between 5400 and 4400 BCE.\n* [Traces of Hallucinogenic Plants and Chile Peppers Found at Maya Ball Court Suggest Rituals Took Place There](\u00a0\u2014 Environmental DNA analysis of a Maya ball court in Yaxnohcah, Mexico, uncovered ceremonial plant bundles, suggesting ritual activities linked to ball games. The study identified remains of xtabentun, a hallucinogenic morning glory, along with lancewood and chile peppers, all historically significant in Maya religious and medicinal practices. These findings, dating back to around 80 CE, highlight the dual use of ball courts in Maya culture, not only for the well-known pok-a-tok games but also for spiritual ceremonies.\n\nHope you enjoyed this abridged version of\u00a0[Ancient Beat]( Have a great weekend!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1cjywj5/this_weeks_archaeological_news_turtle_snacks/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "African delegates denounce UMC LGBT votes: 'Devastated\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/african-delegates-denounce-umc-lgbt-votes-devastated.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Assyriologist claims to have solved archaeological mystery from 700 BC", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-05-assyriologist-archaeological-mystery-bc.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India, Nigeria likely to finalise local currency settlement system agreement soon", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/india-nigeria-likely-to-finalise-local-currency-settlement-system-agreement-soon-19406492.htm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Growing Tolerance for Kashmiri Separatism in US Touches Raw Nerve in India", "summary": "", "link": "https://sputniknews.in/20240503/growing-tolerance-for-kashmiri-separatism-in-us-touches-raw-nerve-in-india-7281056.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces $3 Billion to Replace Toxic Lead Pipes and Deliver Clean Drinking Water to Communities Across the Country | The White House", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-3-billion-to-replace-toxic-lead-pipes-and-deliver-clean-drinking-water-to-communities-across-the-country/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada police arrest \u2018hit squad\u2019 suspects linked to Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar\u2019s murder", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3261409/canada-arrests-hit-squad-suspects-linked-sikh-leader-hardeep-singh-nijjars-murder-report-says?utm_source=ground.news&amp;utm_medium=referral", "author": "None"}, {"title": "js-languages: A simple javascript script to change inner text of your website using json.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/spigbop/js-languages", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland\u2019s biggest gas supplier to increase bills by around 50%", "summary": "", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/04/30/polands-biggest-gas-producer-to-increase-bills-by-around-50/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The UK's Conservatives suffer historic losses in local elections as Labour edges closer to power", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-conservatives-labour-sunak-starmer-71b0348dc6057513bb73f32385039df4", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hungarian foreign minister grants himself luxury jet privileges for official travel", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.atlatszo.hu/2024/04/12/hungarian-foreign-minister-grants-himself-luxury-jet-privileges-for-official-travel/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Modi\u2019s \u2018inner circle\u2019 implicated in murder plots abroad", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1830523", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dirham-rupee trade: A game changer for Indian economy, energy security | Policy Circle", "summary": "Dirham-rupee trade deal: At the annual conference of the Reserve Bank of India in the first week of April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged stakeholders to elevate the rupee to the status of an international currency.
