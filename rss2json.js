Made every mistake possible. Burned through money, created garbage content, got frustrated with inconsistent results.\n\n**Now I\u2019m generating consistently viral content and making money from AI video.** Here\u2019s everything that actually works.\n\n# The fundamental mindset shifts:\n\n# 1. Volume beats perfection\n\nStop trying to create the perfect video. Generate 10 decent videos and select the best one. This approach consistently outperforms perfectionist single-shot attempts.\n\n# 2. Systematic beats creative\n\nProven formulas + small variations outperform completely original concepts every time. Study what works, then execute it better.\n\n# 3. Embrace the AI aesthetic\n\nStop fighting what AI looks like. Beautiful impossibility engages more than uncanny valley realism. Lean into what only AI can create.\n\n# The technical foundation that changed everything:\n\n# The 6-part prompt structure:\n\n    [SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]\n    \n\nThis baseline works across thousands of generations. Everything else is variation on this foundation.\n\n# Front-load important elements\n\nVeo3 weights early words more heavily. \u201cBeautiful woman dancing\u201d \u2260 \u201cWoman, beautiful, dancing.\u201d Order matters significantly.\n\n# One action per prompt rule\n\nMultiple actions create AI confusion. \u201cWalking while talking while eating\u201d = chaos. Keep it simple for consistent results.\n\n# The cost optimization breakthrough:\n\nGoogle\u2019s direct pricing kills experimentation:\n\n* $0.50/second = $30/minute\n* Factor in failed generations = $100+ per usable video\n\nFound companies reselling veo3 credits cheaper. I\u2019ve been using [these guys]( who offer 60-70% below Google\u2019s rates. Makes volume testing actually viable.\n\n# Audio cues are incredibly powerful:\n\nMost creators completely ignore audio elements in prompts. Huge mistake.\n\n**Instead of:** Person walking through forest**Try:** Person walking through forest, Audio: leaves crunching underfoot, distant bird calls, gentle wind through branches\n\nThe difference in engagement is dramatic. Audio context makes AI video feel real even when visually it\u2019s obviously AI.\n\n# Systematic seed approach:\n\nRandom seeds = random results.\n\n**My workflow:**\n\n1. Test same prompt with seeds 1000-1010\n2. Judge on shape, readability, technical quality\n3. Use best seed as foundation for variations\n4. Build seed library organized by content type\n\n# Camera movements that consistently work:\n\n* **Slow push/pull:** Most reliable, professional feel\n* **Orbit around subject:** Great for products and reveals\n* **Handheld follow:** Adds energy without chaos\n* **Static with subject movement:** Often highest quality\n\n**Avoid:** Complex combinations (\u201cpan while zooming during dolly\u201d). One movement type per generation.\n\n# Style references that actually deliver:\n\n**Camera specs:** \u201cShot on Arri Alexa,\u201d \u201cShot on iPhone 15 Pro\u201d\n\n**Director styles:** \u201cWes Anderson style,\u201d \u201cDavid Fincher style\u201d **Movie cinematography:** \u201cBlade Runner 2049 cinematography\u201d\n\n**Color grades:** \u201cTeal and orange grade,\u201d \u201cGolden hour grade\u201d\n\n**Avoid:** Vague terms like \u201ccinematic,\u201d \u201chigh quality,\u201d \u201cprofessional\u201d\n\n# Negative prompts as quality control:\n\nTreat them like EQ filters - always on, preventing problems:\n\n    --no watermark --no warped face --no floating limbs --no text artifacts --no distorted hands --no blurry edges\n    \n\nPrevents 90% of common AI generation failures.\n\n# Platform-specific optimization:\n\n**Don\u2019t reformat one video for all platforms.** Create platform-specific versions:\n\n**TikTok:** 15-30 seconds, high energy, obvious AI aesthetic works\n\n**Instagram:** Smooth transitions, aesthetic perfection, story-driven **YouTube Shorts:** 30-60 seconds, educational framing, longer hooks\n\nSame content, different optimization = dramatically better performance.\n\n# The reverse-engineering technique:\n\nJSON prompting isn\u2019t great for direct creation, but it\u2019s amazing for copying successful content:\n\n1. Find viral AI video\n2. Ask ChatGPT: \u201cReturn prompt for this in JSON format with maximum fields\u201d\n3. Get surgically precise breakdown of what makes it work\n4. Create variations by tweaking individual parameters\n\n# Content strategy insights:\n\n**Beautiful absurdity &gt; fake realism**\n\n**Specific references &gt; vague creativityProven patterns + small twists &gt; completely original conceptsSystematic testing &gt; hoping for luck**\n\n# The workflow that generates profit:\n\n**Monday:** Analyze performance, plan 10-15 concepts\n\n**Tuesday-Wednesday:** Batch generate 3-5 variations each **Thursday:** Select best, create platform versions\n\n**Friday:** Finalize and schedule for optimal posting times\n\n# Advanced techniques:\n\n# First frame obsession:\n\nGenerate 10 variations focusing only on getting perfect first frame. First frame quality determines entire video outcome.\n\n# Batch processing:\n\nCreate multiple concepts simultaneously. Selection from volume outperforms perfection from single shots.\n\n# Content multiplication:\n\nOne good generation becomes TikTok version + Instagram version + YouTube version + potential series content.\n\n# The psychological elements:\n\n# 3-second emotionally absurd hook\n\nFirst 3 seconds determine virality. Create immediate emotional response (positive or negative doesn\u2019t matter).\n\n# Generate immediate questions\n\n\u201cWait, how did they\u2026?\u201d Objective isn\u2019t making AI look real - it\u2019s creating original impossibility.\n\n# Common mistakes that kill results:\n\n1. **Perfectionist single-shot approach**\n2. **Fighting the AI aesthetic instead of embracing it**\n3. **Vague prompting instead of specific technical direction**\n4. **Ignoring audio elements completely**\n5. **Random generation instead of systematic testing**\n6. **One-size-fits-all platform approach**\n\n# The business model shift:\n\nFrom expensive hobby to profitable skill:\n\n* Track what works with spreadsheets\n* Build libraries of successful formulas\n* Create systematic workflows\n* Optimize for consistent output over occasional perfection\n\n# The bigger insight:\n\n**AI video is about iteration and selection, not divine inspiration.** Build systems that consistently produce good content, then scale what works.\n\nMost creators are optimizing for the wrong things. They want perfect prompts that work every time. Smart creators build workflows that turn volume + selection into consistent quality.\n\n# Where AI video is heading:\n\n* **Cheaper access through third parties** makes experimentation viable\n* **Better tools for systematic testing** and workflow optimization\n* **Platform-native AI content** instead of trying to hide AI origins\n* **Educational content about AI techniques** performs exceptionally well\n\nStarted this journey 10 months ago thinking I needed to be creative. Turns out I needed to be systematic.\n\n**The creators making money aren\u2019t the most artistic - they\u2019re the most systematic.**\n\nThese insights took me 10,000+ generations and hundreds of hours to learn.

You have read it line by line, reasoned through it, applied it, and learned its concepts deeply. You also have a particular obsession with ensuring that when conveying the book's topics and examples to the learner, you don't miss a single one of them. In these [number of chapters] sessions, you plan to teach the book's concepts in-depth to an individual at a [beginner, intermediate, professional] level in this field, one chapter per session. In your teaching, you utilize the latest educational methods (diagrams, comparative tables, images, practical examples from outside the book, and small quizzes at the end of the session), and you also keep in mind this principle: a person learns best when they first understand the application and then receive the information.\n\nYour teaching method is as follows: Whatever book you are teaching has its own writing style and content organization. So, you read and learn step-by-step the summary of the main axis, positive and negative examples, the conclusions from the examples, and the author's instructions. Then, you similarly identify the main objectives and the core message of the chapter. You make sure no point is missed. You explain the connections of the concepts in each chapter with the other chapters as well. You do not interject your own opinion; you only convey the author's views and teach using the best educational techniques I mentioned. You also state the applications of the concepts you are teaching.\n\nExplain each chapter or topic of the book to me in separate messages, as if you are conducting different sessions. Please note: only after I write \"Okay\" to you, begin session (each session is the summary of one chapter), and we will continue this until the book's chapters are finished.\n\nThis summary should consist of one to three theoretical paragraphs (in such a way that you read the theory of each chapter completely and explain it comprehensively in your own words, understandable to the audience, without changing the core concept or creating misunderstanding).\n\nI ask that for the topics you explain, you list *all* the examples provided in the book for that topic, item by item, in a way that each one is at most about two sentences long, and you also write its specific conclusion in two additional sentences following that same example.\n\nInclude the *reason why* behind concepts presented in the book as instructions or prohibitions at the end of the section dedicated to explaining that specific topic.\n\nInclude the original language (English) of specialized terms from the book next to their Persian name in parentheses.\n\nFor every solution or instruction you see in the book, provide a visual roadmap, and for each roadmap in your response, dedicate a separate section, mentioning the topic name and the related problem in its title.\n\nAlso, include the golden tips and tricks related to each topic at the end of the explanation for that specific topic.\n\nKeep in mind that I don't care about the length of your response, as long as you correctly execute my requests and instructions.\n\nFurthermore, in the first session, just tell me how many chapters the book has, and after getting an \"Okay\" from me, begin teaching with the same procedure I outlined.\n\nThe summary should ultimately be about 25% the volume of the original text (in terms of the number of lines).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Don't forget to fill the [ ]s by your subjective info.\n**It explains every chapter separately after you give it \"Ok\" it starts another chapter.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mv1ayb/best_book_summary_you_ever_had/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Code \u2014 open-source coding CLI with browser control and multi-agent workflows", "summary": "Code is a new open-source coding CLI that integrates directly with your browser and multiple AI agents.
