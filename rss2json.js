He is accused of crimes relating to four incidents \u2013 the most infamous among them his attack on a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah in parliament in December 2023 \u2013 and could face prison if convicted.\n\nBraun, who has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, declared in court that he was facing trial because he had \u201cdared to defend myself against Jewish supremacy\u201d. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside to show their support.\n\nThe case has taken so long to come to trial because prosecutors needed first to apply for Braun to be\u00a0[stripped of legal immunity](\u00a0by Poland\u2019s parliament and then, after he was subsequently elected to the European Parliament, repeat the process. He was finally\u00a0[charged](\u00a0and\u00a0[indicted](\u00a0in July this year.\n\nIn the meantime, Braun has revelled in his notoriety. Standing in this year\u2019s presidential elections, he used as his logo an image of the fire extinguisher with which he\u00a0[attempted to put out Hanukkah candles in parliament](\n\nWhile he began the campaign as a rank outsider, Braun ended up\u00a0[finishing fourth in the election]( winning 6.3% of the vote.\n\nIn relation to the Hanukkah incident, Braun has been indicted for the crimes of\u00a0insulting a religious group, malicious interference with a religious act and offending religious feelings, as well as assaulting and causing harm to the health of a woman who had been involved in the ceremony.\n\nOffending religious sentiment is a crime in Poland, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to two years. The law is\u00a0[quite often invoked]( though normally for alleged insults against the feelings of Catholics, who make up the majority of Poland\u2019s population.\n\nAddressing the court today, Braun declared: \u201cI am accused by Jews who are \u2018professional Jews.\u2019 That is, they represent various formations and associations. I have been ritually cursed and damned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am standing before this court because I dared to defend myself against oppression and the ritual manifestation of Jewish supremacy,\u201d he added, quoted by news service I.pl.\n\nAt the same trial, Braun is also facing charges of\u00a0causing damage to property and disturbing the peace\u00a0[during a lecture by Jan Grabowski]( a Polish-Canadian Holocaust scholar, and during a separate incident in which he\u00a0removed a Christmas tree from a courthouse because it was decorated with EU and LGBT+ flags.\n\nFinally, he has been indicted for assaulting and insulting a public official during an incident in which Braun entered the National Institute of Cardiology and confronted its director, \u0141ukasz Szumowski.\n\nSzumowski was Poland\u2019s health minister during part of the Covid pandemic and has been\u00a0[blamed by Braun and his supporters](\u00a0for the lockdown and vaccination policies that they see as part of a global conspiracy.\u00a0\n\nHe also called for the removal of the judge presiding over the case, Marcin Brzostko, arguing that he was appointed to his position unlawfully after the judicial reforms of the former Law and Justice (PiS) government\u00a0[rendered the body responsible for nominating judges illegitimate](\n\n\u201cI do not want to enter into this dispute \\[over the rule of law\\], but out of procedural prudence,\u00a0I do not want to participate in proceedings whose legality may be questioned later,\u201d said Braun, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nBrzostko, however, announced that a separate court had considered Braun\u2019s request to exclude him and had rejected it.\n\nAfter the indictments against him were read, Braun pleaded not guilty, saying that he had \u201cacted in the public interest\u201d. Among the various offences he is accused of, the maximum prison sentence he could face if found guilty is three years.\n\nBraun is separately subject to investigations by prosecutors for a number of other alleged crimes, many relating to various anti-Jewish, anti-LGBT and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric and actions carried out during his presidential campaign this year.\n\nLast month, the European Parliament\u00a0[again stripped Braun of immunity](\u00a0to face charges for six alleged crimes, including inciting religious hatred against Jews, assaulting a doctor involved in carrying out a late-term abortion, and\u00a0[vandalising](\u00a0an LGBT+ exhibition.\n\nThere are also two further requests to lift Braun\u2019s immunity still pending.
