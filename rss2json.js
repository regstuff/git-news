Our troops got the most casualties fighting in someones others war in WW1 and WW2. Haven't we learned our lessons since then? Why are we still fighting for others interests?\nSecond that our troops gets excited when they get selected for UN missions. Isn't that a collonial mindset? Why do you want to fight where u can get injured or take casualties fighting for others interests?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1fhyqzq/un_mission_in_sudan/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dallas nonprofit creates 'toolkit' to combat housing displacement | KERA News", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.keranews.org/news/2024-09-16/builders-of-hope-dallas-toolkit-combat-housing-displacement", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Stone-eaters That Threaten Iran's Ancient Persepolis", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.barrons.com/news/the-stone-eaters-that-threaten-iran-s-ancient-persepolis-3dec26ab", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Are Indian n Chinese govt deescalating coz of Bangladesh regime change?

If this happens Bangladesh regime change would be worst move played by deep state and CIA.\n\nThis might be intellectual jerk off but China-India-Russian alliance with 1/3 of population, lots of resources n tech oriented youth will be a economic / military nightmare for west.
