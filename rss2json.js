They're missing how to ask it.", "summary": "Everyone copies those \"proven prompts\" from the internet, then wonders why they get the same bland, useless responses as everyone else.\n\nWhen you ask AI to \"write marketing copy for my business\", it has zero clue what you're selling, who wants it, or why they should care. So it spits out generic corporate fluff because that's the safest bet.\n\n**Here's how it makes a real difference:**\n\n**Bad prompt:** \"Write a sales email to freelance graphic designers to sell them my template for saving time with client revisions.\"\n\n**Good prompt:** \"Write a sales email to freelance graphic designers who are tired of clients asking for endless revisions and who want to save time. I'm selling a contract template that allows them to do exactly that. Use a confident and professional tone (the goal is to build trust and authority). I want as many people as possible to click through to my landing page. Every graphic designer runs into frustration around revision, since it takes time and more potential revenue that could be made.\"\n\nSee that? The second version tells the AI exactly who you're talking to, what problem you're solving, and what you want to happen. The AI can actually help instead of just guessing what you're looking for.\n\n**Here's the simple framework:**\n\n1. **WHO** are you talking to? (Be specific. Not just \"small business owners\")\n2. **WHAT** problem are you solving?\n3. **WHY** should they care right now?\n4. **HOW** do you want it written? (tone, length, format, ...)\n5. **WHAT** counts as success?\n6. **Anything else** the AI should know?\n\nThis works for everything. Blog posts, code, analysis, creative stuff. The pattern never changes: **give precise context = get better results**.\n\n**This is the secret**: the better you understand the task and the intended result, the better you can provide the details an AI model needs in order to give you relevant and precise outputs. It's that simple, and I cannot stress enough how important this is. It is the first and most important step in writing valuable prompts.\n\nStop treating AI like it can read your mind. Give it the details it needs to actually help you. The more details, the better.\n\nI'm always testing new approaches and genuinely want to see what challenges you're running into. Plus, I'm putting together a group of serious prompters and solopreneurs to share frameworks and test new techniques.

Like Anthropic would already tell Claude how to respond to your request. So I'm not convinced that re-using some made some prompt template you came up with is better than crafting a simple prompt on the fly for whatever I'm trying to do, or just simply meta-prompting and starting a new conversation. Literally, just tell the agent to meta-prompt and start a new conversation.  \n\nIMO prompt engineering has to have some way of actually measuring results. Like suppose I want to measure how well a prompt solves coding problems. I would need at least a few thousand coding problems to benchmark. To measure and find the best prompt. And it needs to be at a scale that proves statiscal significance across whatever kind of task the prompt is for.  \n\nAnd ultimately, what are you actually trying to achieve? To get more correct answers with fewer tokens? To get better results regardless of token count?  \n\nJust to give you a specific example, I want Claude to stop calling everything sophisticated. I'm so sick of that word dude! But I'm not convinced telling Claude not to say sophisticated is a good idea because it's going to distract Claude from the coding task I'm giving it. But me just telling Claude things isn't prompt engineering. It's just prompting!  \n\nThe engineering comes in when you're trying to actually engineer something.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mplt36/this_sub_isnt_for_tips_on_how_to_prompt_chatgpt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Emmanuel Macron admits French colonial repression in Cameroon independence struggle", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly39dd36epo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\udca1", "summary": "\ud83d\udca1 Artificial Intelligence is a bridge, it is not a path on which people can walk.   \n\\- sumit  \n  \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mpp41a/_/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Has anyone tested humanizers against Copyleaks lately?", "summary": "Curious what changed this year.

The tool assumes it's operating in a potentially untrusted environment and gives you the power to verify its behavior and lock down its capabilities.\n\n\n\n1. Verifiable Zero-Egress\n\nWe claim the tool is air-gapped, but you shouldn't have to take our word for it.\n\nHow it works: At startup, the CLI can monkey-patch Node.js's http and https modules. Any outbound request is intercepted. If the destination isn't on an explicit allowlist (e.g., localhost for a local vector server), the request is blocked, and the process exits with a non-zero status code.\n\nHow to verify: Run agm prove-offline. This command attempts to make a DNS lookup to a public resolver. It will fail and print a confirmation that the network guard is active. This allows you to confirm at any time that no data is leaving your machine.\n\n2. Supply Chain Integrity for Shared Context: The .agmctx Bundle\n\nWhen you share context with a colleague, you need to be sure it hasn't been tampered with. The .agmctx bundle format is designed for this.\n\n\n\nWhen you run agm export-context --sign --zip:\n\n\n\nChecksums First: A checksums.json file is created, containing the SHA-256 hash of every file in the export (the manifest, the vector map, etc.).\n\nCryptographic Signature: An Ed25519 key pair (generated and stored locally in keys) is used to sign the SHA-256 hash of the concatenated checksums. This signature is stored in signature.bin.\n\nVerification on Import: When agm import-context runs, it performs the checks in reverse order:\n\nIt first verifies that the checksum of every file matches the value in checksums.json. If any file has been altered, it fails immediately with exit code 4 (Checksum Mismatch). This prevents wasting CPU cycles on a tampered package.\n\nIf the checksums match, it then verifies the signature against the public key. If the signature is invalid, it fails with exit code 3 (Invalid Signature).\n\nThis layered approach ensures both integrity and authenticity.\n\n3. Policy-Driven Operation\n\nThe tool is governed by a policy.json file in your project's .antigoldfishmode directory. This file is your control panel for the tool's behavior.\n\n\n\nCommand Whitelisting: You can restrict which agm commands are allowed to run. For example, you could disable export-context entirely in a highly sensitive project.\n\nFile Path Globs: Restrict the tool to only read from specific directories (e.g., src and docs, but not dist or node\\_modules).\n\nEnforced Signing Policies:\n\n\"requireSignedContext\": true: The tool will refuse to import any .agmctx bundle that isn't signed with a valid signature. This is a critical security control for teams.\n\n\"forceSignedExports\": true: This makes signing non-optional. Even if a user tries to export with --no-sign, the policy will override it and sign the export.\n\n4. Transparent Auditing via Receipts and Journal\n\nYou should never have to wonder what the tool did.\n\nReceipts: Every significant command (export, import, index-code, etc.) generates a JSON receipt in receipts. This receipt contains a cryptographic hash of the inputs and outputs, timing data, and a summary of the operation.\n\nJournal: A journal.jsonl file provides a chronological, append-only log of every command executed and its corresponding receipt ID. This gives you a complete, verifiable audit trail of all actions performed by the tool.\n\nThis combination of features is designed to provide a tool that is not only powerful but also transparent, verifiable, and secure enough for the most sensitive development environments.\n\nYou can check out the source code on GitHub: [\n\n", "link": "https://github.com/jahboukie/antigoldfish", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How I 10x my prompt engineering skills with this simple tool", "summary": "**TL;DR:** I built a Chrome extension called [Promptr One]( that takes any plain-text prompt you write in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc., formats it into a clean, structured template using AI, and replaces your original input \u2014 making prompt engineering faster, easier, and more consistent. It also stores templates locally (create your own template!), supports multiple models, and will soon allow user-supplied API keys and shared templates.\n\n# Background\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI first want to say thanks to all of the members of this sub, they have been a huge inspiration for my templates and they have helped me tremendously with the links they shared and their ideas.\n\n# The story\n\nI have been using ChatGPT since the GPT-3 model and have been a plus user for more than 2 years now. I pretty much use AI daily mostly for programming, school, and learning new skills. One thing I was always curious about was prompt engineering. I saw multiple times people saying that they have this perfect prompt that would help them get the most out of AI, but I was never able to apply it consistently for the following reasons:\n\n* I would forget about the template the next day\n* I was too lazy to transform my prompt in a JSON, XML, or Markdown template. It just didn't feel natural.\n\nFor a long time I stopped trying to improve my prompts, but I was stuck in a loop where it felt like I was getting mediocre results with AI and I knew that it was because my prompts were just not good enough, but I was still too lazy to write clean and well-formatted prompts and follow the rules that everyone talks about here.\n\n# The breakthrough\n\nThis was until I found the article that completely changed the way I work and gave me the idea that boosted my productivity to new levels I didn't even believe before: [Claude prompt engineering guide]( For those who haven't read the docs and haven't played with Claude prompt generator, it's simply a tool that helps you perfect your prompt and helps you test it by generating examples and you can see the results. You can also create new versions of the prompt and improve it with Claude.\n\nIt may sound stupid and pretty obvious but I was finally realizing that I could simply use AI to polish my prompts. I can finally write my prompts in plain text and then instruct Claude or any other LLM to structure them following a specific template.\n\n# The solution\n\nGreat! But there is still an issue: How am I going to remember and store all of these awesome prompts I see everywhere online? Well, this is when everything clicked: I can just use a Chrome extension that will do the following steps for me:\n\nTake my input in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or any other LLM -&gt; Send it with the template of my choice to OpenAI so it can format my prompt with a set of instructions defined in the template -&gt; Replace my input with the new formatted prompt! That's it, I was finally able to solve the two most annoying parts of prompt engineering (well, at least for me): storing my templates and going from natural text to a well-structured prompt.\n\nI have been playing with it so far and I'm really excited to share my extension with you guys: you can read about it here: [Promptr one](\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Do I store your inputs and outputs in the database?** Input and output is NEVER stored in the database, the text is only processed and returned to the user. I will soon add a feature to handle users bringing their own API key and also adding more supported models if people are interested. You can still see the history since it's saved in the Chrome extension local storage (on your computer).\n\n**Will the extension be available on other browsers?** If there is a request for it, sure! I'm currently working on the extension in Cursor, so users will be able to use their templates directly in Cursor since it's one of my biggest requests so far.\n\n**Will there be new templates?** Yup I will be adding new templates pretty much every day. I also want to add a feature in the future where users can share their templates and we can even rank which templates are most used for each subject.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions, I will be happy to hear you out! I will also be offering free pro tier to anyone who wants to work with me by giving me feedback and suggestions to improve this extension.
