When I wasn't doing sadhana, I could clearly feel it's effect exactly like **Sadhguru** has spoken of in a video (quotes below)  \n\\- \"*When there is sexual interaction, or intimacy which involves thought, emotion and body, the amount of memory that is left in your system is very big. If you unconsciously pick up enormous amounts of memory it'll become very* ***difficult to remain peaceful &amp; joyful*** *in your life no matter what good things might be happening, simply because there is confusing memories. When something else of similar nature cones, the body goes into a* ***turmoil of confusion****\"*  \n*- \"If there is certain level of chaos in this memory, then you may know everything but this* ***memory will work against you*** *because it's contradictory and conflicting within itself.\"*  \n*- \"If you create a lot of contradictory memory in you system, you will see life will tell later, that you will have everything but you will* ***feel like you have nothing****, because it's confused and it's joyless, it* ***doesn't have exuberance****.\"*  \n*- \"...you will become a* ***loose life****\"*  \n\n\nI just wonder how long it would take or if it ever even will happen that I am able to dissolve this runanubandha that has developed. \nIn some discussions I've had, I have been told the following by people which has stuck with me (would like to hear opinions on this too)  \n1. \"Once there is penetration, doesn't matter if you are speaking to the person or not, you are now connected to them for life. You both are connected at a subtler plane and will continue to exchange energies.\"  \n2. \"When you do sadhana, the other also experiences its benefits, because you are connected in spirit.\"  \n3. \"You will collect their qualities once you have sex and it's not easy to get rid of them.\"  \n4. \"As a woman, you are at a bigger loss than the man, if you indulge.\"\n\nAbout all these points, even point 3, I feel it doesn't matter if its their qualities or mine, because the whole point is to transcend all of it, even if its good.\n\nI understand from sadhana's perspective and experience (the nothingness, no thought, no preference, no form one enters) that it doesn't matter even if I will be largely impacted by this runanubandha this life.   \nYet, this question has been with me for over a year and hence I'd like to know the sub's precious takes.\n\nAll opinions and knowledge is welcome.\n\nAnother post.. typing which has helped me greatly.  \nThank you, grateful for this space, the beauty that is Reddit and all the fantastic people active here.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bshovo/relentless_runanubandha/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Materialious - A modern interface for Invidious", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/WardPearce/Materialious", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin orders 150,000 conscripts into military service", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/putin-orders-150000-conscripts-into-military-service/a-68707491", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Union (left) and Confederate (right) veterans meet for the Battle of Gettysburg's 50th anniversary in 1913.

Python's nltk package uses two POS taggers, AveragedPerceptronTagger and StanfordTagger that come with pretrained weights downloaded from the nltk_data repository. If someone wishes to write their existing NLP pipeline in Rust, a POS tagger implementation is crucial.\n\n## Project\n\npostagger.rs is a rewrite of AveragedPerceptronTagger (originally in Python) and uses the same weights that the Python version uses. Alongside the Rust API, I've also produced C bindings with cbindgen and Java bindings with JNI.\n\nWriting the FFI was tricky, as it comprised of transporting custom C structs (or Java objects) across the interface. In the Java wrapper, I had to return a JSON string with the results, just to tackle the complexity of returning a custom object. This was not a problem with C, thanks to cbindgen.\n\n\nuse postagger::PerceptronTagger;\n\nfn main() {\n    let tagger = PerceptronTagger::new( \"tagger/weights.json\" , \"tagger/classes.txt\" , \"tagger/tags.json\" )  ; \n    let tags = tagger.tag( \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" ) ;\n    for tag in &amp;tags {\n        println!( \"{} {} {}\" , tag.word , tag.tag , tag.conf ) ; \n    }\n}\n\nOutput:\n\nthe DT 1\nquick JJ 1\nbrown NN 0.9741066\nfox NN 0.85340536\njumps VBZ 0.90339375\nover IN 0.9998745\nthe DT 1\nlazy JJ 0.9865011\ndog NN 0.9999973\n\nThe library is available as a crate of crates.io and\n\non GitHub: \n\nI would be glad if Rust + ML enthusiasts can collaborate on the project.
