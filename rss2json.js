The one drawback has been that there's no easy replacement for the ChatGPT app for Mac, which I used on a regular basis to access the chat interface in a floating window. I know Anthropic has a similar application for Claude that people might be familiar with. I hadn't found an easy replacement for this... until now.\n\n[MenubarX]( is a Mac App Store app that puts a tiny icon in the menu bar that, when clicked, opens a small, mobile sized web browser window. It took only thirty seconds to configure it to point at my local Open WebUI interface, allowing me to use Open WebUI in the same way I had used ChatGPT's Mac app.\n\nIt does have a \"pro\" version unlockable through an in app purchase but I have found this unnecessary for how I use it. And to be clear, I don't have any affiliation with the developers.\n\nIt's a perfect solution, I just wish I knew about it earlier!
