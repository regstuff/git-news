The model with predictive auxiliary objectives learned faster and required fewer training iterations compared to models without this additional task.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 The activity patterns in the model's prediction module resembled those in the hippocampus of animals, with place fields forming that became active at specific positions in the virtual space. The model's input module also showed learning-related changes, with units responding more selectively to rewarded visual stimuli, similar to neurons in the visual cortex.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 The study suggests that predictive learning could be a key mechanism by which the hippocampus provides structured representations for other brain areas. The researchers plan to conduct further studies with more complex tasks and additional learning-supportive goals to make the models more biologically realistic and potentially inspire new approaches for efficient machine learning and flexible AI.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1croqtp/ai_study_sheds_new_light_on_the_role_of_the/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "BioHive-2 to speed up drug development by several years", "summary": "\ud83e\uddec Biopharmaceutical company Recursion has commissioned BioHive-2, the most powerful supercomputer in the pharmaceutical industry.\r\nThe system features 504 Nvidia H100 GPUs and achieves 2 exaflops of AI performance.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 BioHive-2 allows Recursion scientists to select the most promising areas of biology for their experiments.
