Seeking advice on DeBERTa decoder configs, query prefix strategies, and loss functions for supervised fine-tuning. Also looking for general tips and common pitfalls to avoid... And an other infinite series of question.*\n\n\nI'm working on fine-tuning a retrieval model (currently using the sentence-transformer library for simplicity). I'm considering DeBERTa v3 large and DeBERTa v2 xxlarge (1.5B param) as base models. unfortunately, there's no v3 xlarge, which is really sad since v3 uses an ELECTRA-style pretraining that's more effective and efficient than the classic MLM of BERT/RoBERTa/DeBERTa v1-2.\n\n\nMy pipeline uses various datasets, ranging from retrieval-oriented ones like MSMARCO and GooQA to smaller datasets for asymmetrical retrieval, sentence similarity, NLI, and sentence compression...i then fine-tune on smaller datasets generated using GPT-4, Claude sonnet, and Command R Plus (I used multiple models to avoid stylistic bias and to increase variability).\n\n\nThe use case may be defined \"knowledge retrieval\" in the medical/biomedical domain but can be generalized to STEM fields. \nI've had great results by adding an unsupervised fine-tuning step before my usual pipeline, with the TSDAE approach being particularly effective. However, there's no config for DeBERTa models when used as decoders in the transformers library, so I ended up using RoBERTa large and e5-unsupervised large. \n\nI'm seeking advice from those with experience in similar projects. Specifically:\n\n- Does anyone know how to obtain a config for DeBERTa as a decoder?\n\n- Regarding query prefixes or instructions, is there a consensus on the best approach? should I simply prepend the query text, use the \"[SEP]\" token between query and input text, or use a new custom token?\n\n- For supervised fine-tuning loss, are there any recommended choices? I used Multiple Negative Ranking Loss, then switched to GISTEmbed, which provided better results (using Snowflake Arctic large as a \"guide\" in the GISTEmbed loss to remove false negatives that occur with in-batch negative mining).\nDue to hardware limitationd, I've been using cached versions of these losses to effectively increase the batch size beyond my GPU VRAM limits. As expected, both GISTEmbed and MNRL performance are directly proportional to the batch size, given the in-batch negative mining.\n\n- Which pooling strategies (e.g., CLS token, mean pooling, max pooling, attentive pooling) have shown the best results for generating document/query embeddings in retrieval tasks?\n\n- Which learning rate schedules have worked well for fine-tuning large models like DeBERTa for retrieval tasks? Are there any domain-specific considerations for decay rates or warmup periods?\n\n- What are the most effective strategies for continued pretraining in the medical/STEM domain? Are there specific techniques or datasets that work particularly well?\n\n- Regarding unsupervised learning approaches, I've had success with TSDAE. are there other unsupervised methods that have shown promise for retrieval tasks in specialized domains?\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text and for all of those question... \n\nAny tips or advice to avoid common mistakes would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance to the whole community.
