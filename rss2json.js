Japan didn\u2019t share the US\u2019s Cold War alignment with Pakistan and instead had a longstanding respect for India\u2019s ancient civilization. This mutual regard translated into Japan\u2019s support for India\u2019s socio-economic goals through substantial Official Development Assistance (ODA).\n\nDespite this, Japan\u2019s economic presence in India remained limited due to an unwelcoming business environment, leading Japanese companies to favor Southeast Asia and China. The relationship faced a setback after India\u2019s nuclear tests in 1998, which led to a freeze in relations. However, this period of introspection paved the way for a renewed partnership, highlighted by key diplomatic visits and a stronger bilateral focus.\n\nIn recent years, India-Japan ties have strengthened, marked by annual summits since 2006 and the establishment of a Special Strategic and Global Partnership in 2014. Japanese investments in India have expanded, and ODA has more than doubled in the last decade, supporting major infrastructure projects like the high-speed rail from Mumbai to Ahmedabad.\n\nCooperation has deepened in sensitive areas such as civil nuclear energy and defense, with a series of agreements since 2014 covering defense cooperation, equipment transfers, and reciprocal military supplies.

Though not related to India, it can affect us.\n\nMy latest post (link below), written today, looks at the predictions made in my previous post of 10 June and suggests what might happen next.\n\nI had posted that Israel will be in a position to start a ground operation against Hezbollah by the end of August. That would be the time operations in Gaza would largely be over with Hamas largely degraded and losing the ability to offer organized resistance.\n\nI estimate casualties for both sides - in terms of irrecoverable losses and suggest that the exchange ratio, far from being an implausible 50:1 is a more credible 10:1.\n\nI argue that unlike 2006, Hezbollah is stuck in a battle of attrition it cannot win, nor can the Lebanese economy afford to continue confrontation with Israel. Iran and Hezbollah have no good choices. Hezbollah loses face by staying in place and by retreating behind the Litani river.\n\nI suggest it was not in Netanyahu's interest to negotiate a ceasefire agreement when he has the opportunity to resolve the Hamas ad Hezbollah threats and put a wo state solution on the backburner. Israel as done this so far by controlling escalation dominance.\n\nI analyze the Houthi threat and while it has resulted in a reduction of shipping through the Suez canal (which has hurt Egypt mor than Israel) the threat is overblown with only one ship sunk of the 82 vulnerable ships targeted by the Houthis, some by multiple cruise missiles.\n\nI believe a strong Hezbollah response will result in an Israeli ground operation to reach the Litani river to implement UN resolution 1701.  \n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1f13uin/gazahezbollah_wars_blog_update/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018We need to start moving people and key infrastructure away from our coasts,\u2019 warns climate scientist", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/we-need-to-start-moving-people-and-key-infrastructure-away-from-our-coasts-warns-climate-scientist/a546015582.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Taiwan introduces ban on performances by captive wild animals ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/5924846", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u201cI wish everyone in the Kremlin would drop dead\u201d: Testimonies from war-torn Kursk Oblast, where locals have been left to their own devices", "summary": "", "link": "https://theins.press/en/society/274092", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI-powered answer engine for your documents and materials", "summary": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe've built a Discord bot that lets you upload documents and ask questions about their content.
