The trio also held talks focused on security, and in particular Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOne reflection that dominated today is that it\u2019s been 163 years since the January Uprising and one thing remains unchanged: Russia is still a threat to the region,\u201d said Poland\u2019s Karol Nawrocki. \u201cRegardless of whether it is Tsarist Russia, Bolshevik Russia or Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\u201d\n\nSpeaking alongside him, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky emphasised that the event was a reminder that \u201call of us in our part of Europe must fight and struggle to protect our sovereignty, our freedom and our independence\u201d.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da, who hosted the summit,\u00a0likewise declared that the \u201ccourage, faith and sacrifice \\[of the January insurgents\\] are an example to us all\u201d, showing that \u201ccommitment to freedom and refusal to submit to tyranny are a shared historical legacy\u201d.\u00a0\n\nThe January Uprising began on 22 January 1863 in so-called Congress Poland, which was a puppet state of Russia. Its area covered much of modern-day central and eastern Poland, as well as parts of Lithuania.\n\nThe insurrection initially broke out among Poles conscripted into the Russian army, and was joined by tens of thousands more, including Lithuanians and Belarusians. (Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya also joined today\u2019s ceremonies.)\n\nThe uprising was brutally suppressed by Russia \u2013 with thousands of Poles killed and many more deported to Siberia \u2013 and was eventually brought to an end in 1864, though Russian reprisals against the local population continued long after.\u00a0\n\nToday\u2019s meeting took place under the auspices of the\u00a0[Lublin Triangle]( a regional alliance established in 2020 between Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine. It is named after the 1569 Treaty of Lublin, which created the\u00a0[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]( a state that also contained much of modern-day Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Nawrocki recalled that the countries of their region had been proven right in their longstanding warnings about Russia. That emphasises why \u201cit is important for the voice of central and eastern Europe, and forums like this one, to be heard worldwide\u201d.\n\nHe and Naus\u0117da noted that Zelensky had updated them on the progress of peace negotiations, with Naus\u0117da commenting that, \u201cnot for the first time, we see Russia not wanting to commit to peace\u201d.\n\nZelensky, meanwhile, thanked Poland and Lithuania for their strong support since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.
