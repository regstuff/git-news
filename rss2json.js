Whenever a new model comes out, I ask this question, and the answers are highly plausible but totally incorrect, usually suggesting that he became more adventurous over time. The simple answer is that Reicha instead became more conservative over time, with his earlier works being quirkiest; a more accurate and sophisticated answer would consider the various purposes of composition (curiosity, ambition, professional expectation, camaraderie) and the variable quality of his work and would have to involve fresh scholarship about the actual dates, which are often uncertain.

But what does it reflect about llm creativity? Mistral-7b will give crazy nonsensical far-less-plausible answers to this question, but they're a lot more \"interesting\" if you ignore truth (mistral's answer below is not THAT interesting, but a composer who started as a church organist and then dramatically changed course both upon learning about haydn and later upon learning about beethoven is more interesting than what gpt-4 comes up with). I think of it as, mistral-7b knows a tiny bit about Reicha--roughly when he composed and that he has some sort of relationship with Beethoven and Haydn--and comes up with various unrealistic narratives accordingly. gpt-4o is equally or more useless for information, since it sounds more plausible but is still wrong, but because it knows more about Reicha and about the typical course of composers' careers, its incorrect answer is also less interesting.\n\nI guess this is a similar problem as \"delve\"--when the models become more knowledgeable and coherent, do they become really annoyingly dull without very very extensive prompting? If you ask gpt-4o to give an implausible and interesting answer, it just dresses up its original answer with some crap like \"aliens told him about new harmonies\"--it's still not creative, because now instead of being confined by its knowledge of reicha and of other composers, it's confined by the least-common-denominator representation of \"implausible theory\".\n\nI'm mostly curious if this question--the trade-off between coherence and interestingness--has been deeply explored by anyone. I'm sure it has, just want to read more.\n\n[Mistral-7b-chat](\n\n&gt; Anton Reicha, a French composer of the Romantic period, is known for his innovative and versatile compositions. His style evolved significantly over time as he incorporated new musical ideas and techniques into his works.\n\n&gt; Reicha began his career as an organist and choir director in the early 18th century. During this time, his music was heavily influenced by the Baroque style of Bach and Handel. He composed various religious pieces such as motets, cantatas, and oratorios that showcased his skillful handling of counterpoint and harmony.\n\n&gt; In the late 1700s, Reicha became interested in contemporary music and started studying composition with Joseph Haydn. This exposure to Classical symphonies and chamber music led him to develop a more secular repertoire. He began writing sonatas for violin and piano, symphonic poems, and operettas, which reflected the changing tastes of the public towards lighter genres.\n\n&gt; Around 1820, Reicha experienced a shift in his aesthetic again when he came across the works of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven. The profound emotions and expressive power of Beethoven's music greatly . . .\n\ngpt-4o with temperature 0:\n\n&gt; Anton Reicha's compositional style underwent significant evolution over the course of his career, reflecting his broad musical influences and innovative spirit. Here are some key aspects of how his style changed over time:\n\n&gt; 1. **Early Period (Late 18th Century):**\n   - **Classical Influence:** In his early works, Reicha was heavily influenced by the Classical style, particularly the works of Haydn and Mozart. This period includes his early symphonies, chamber music, and piano works, which adhere to the formal structures and harmonic language typical of the Classical era.\n   - **Traditional Forms:** His compositions from this period often employed traditional forms such as sonata-allegro, minuet and trio, and rondo.\n\n&gt; 2. **Middle Period (Early 19th Century):**\n   - **Innovative Techniques:** As Reicha matured, he began to experiment more with form and harmony. He was particularly interested in counterpoint and fugue, and he wrote several theoretical works on these subjects. His \"36 Fugues for Piano\" (1803) is a notable example of his innovative approach to counterpoint.\n   - **Wind Quintets:** Reicha is perhaps best known for his wind quintets, composed during this period. These works were groundbreaking in their use of wind instruments and contributed significantly to the development of the wind quintet as a genre. They exhibit a blend of Classical clarity and innovative textures and harmonies.\n\n&gt; 3. **Later Period (Mid-19th Century):**\n   - **Harmonic Experimentation:** In his later years, Reicha's music became more adventurous harmonically. He explored unusual modulations, chromaticism, and even early forms of polytonality. His theoretical work \"Trait\u00e9 de haute composition musicale\" (1824-1826) outlines many of his advanced ideas on harmony and composition.\n   - **Influence on Romanticism:** While Reicha himself is not typically classified as a Romantic composer, his later works and theoretical writings had a significant influence on the next generation of composers, including his students Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, and C\u00e9sar Franck. His forward-thinking ideas helped pave the way for the harmonic and structural innovations of the Romantic era.\n\n&gt; Throughout his career, Reicha maintained a balance between respect for classical forms and a desire to push the boundaries of musical expression. His contributions to music theory and his innovative compositions have earned him a lasting place in the history of Western music.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cu69bd/how_does_the_creative_behavior_of_small_models/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Musicians Algorithmically Generate Every Possible Melody, Release Them to Public Domain", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxepzw/musicians-algorithmically-generate-every-possible-melody-release-them-to-public-domain", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India must support Israel.
