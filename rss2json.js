Both Orb\u00e1n and Nawrocki are also close to Donald Trump. But they hold very different positions towards Russia.\n\nThe Polish president was due to visit Hungary on 3-4 December, attending a summit of presidents of the Visegrad Group \u2013 which consists of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic \u2013 in Esztergom on Wednesday, followed by a meeting with Orb\u00e1n in Budapest on Thursday.\n\nHowever, today, the head of the president\u2019s foreign policy office, Marcin Przydacz, confirmed that Nawrocki would now only attend the Wednesday summit.\n\n\u201cIn connection with the visit to Moscow carried out by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and its context, President Nawrocki decided to limit the program of his visit to Hungary exclusively to the summit of the presidents of the Visegr\u00e1d Group in Esztergom,\u201d wrote Przydacz.\n\n\u201cPresident Nawrocki consistently advocates for seeking ways to end the war in Ukraine caused by Russia,\u201d added Przydacz, but also believes \u201cthat Europe\u2019s security depends on solidarity, including in the field of energy\u201d.\n\nLater, speaking to broadcaster TVN, Nawrocki\u2019s spokesman, Rafa\u0142 Le\u015bkiewicz, said that, \u201cin view of what happened on Friday \u2013 the meeting between Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n and the criminal Putin \u2013 it is obvious that the president has cancelled this visit and will not meet with Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n\u201d.\u00a0\n\nOn Friday, Orb\u00e1n travelled to Moscow, where he met with Putin. Afterwards, the Hungarian prime minister said he had secured supplies of Russian oil and gas, and had also reiterated Budapest\u2019s offer to host peace talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States.\n\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s visit was criticised by other EU leaders, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz saying that the Hungarian prime minister was \u201cacting without a European mandate and he is doing so without consulting us\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s government \u2013 a broad, pro-EU coalition ranging from left to centre right \u2013 has also regularly clashed with Orb\u00e1n, both\u00a0[over his close ties with Russia](\u00a0and also his decision to offer refuge to PiS politicians fleeing justice in Poland.\n\nLast year, Hungary\u00a0[granted asylum](\u00a0to a former PiS government minister who was facing criminal charges in Poland, prompting Warsaw to\u00a0[withdraw its ambassador]( This month, former PiS justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro\u00a0[took refuge in Budapest](\u00a0amid efforts to bring charges against him in Poland.\n\nWhile Nawrocki and PiS are aligned with Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party on many issues, the two sides differ markedly on the question of Russia. Nawrocki and PiS regard Moscow as a perennial and major threat to Poland and Europe.\n\nThose differences\u00a0[led to a break](\u00a0between PiS and Fidesz following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. However, more recently, the two sides have once again\u00a0[moved closer](\n\nIn September, soon after Nawrocki had taken office, Orb\u00e1n said that he believed the new Polish president could help \u201crebuild Polish-Hungarian cooperation\u201d, reported news website Onet at the time. However, the cancellation of next week\u2019s meeting between the pair appears to have damaged those hopes.\n\nFigures from Poland\u2019s ruling coalition welcomed Nawrocki\u2019s decision, but also suggested that it shows the dangers of the president\u2019s\u00a0[critical rhetoric towards the EU](\u00a0and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe president gave Orban the brush-off,\u201d wrote foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski. \u201cA few more months and maybe they \\[Nawrocki and PiS\\] will realise that those who hate the European Union and Ukraine mostly love Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cFew things are surprising in Polish politics,\u201d wrote interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski. \u201cBut the fact that President Nawrocki listened to the voice of the prime minister and, more broadly, the government regarding Orb\u00e1n\u2019s harmful, pro-Russian policy is cause for moderate optimism.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/30/polands-president-nawrocki-cancels-orban-meeting-after-hungarian-pms-putin-visit/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Takaichi uses line from 'Attack on Titan' to drum up investment", "summary": "Takaichi Yeager", "link": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/12/01/takaichi-attack-on-titan-investment/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland charges three Belarusians and two Ukrainians with espionage", "summary": "Poland has charged three Belarusians and two Ukrainians \u2013 one of whom is a minor \u2013 with carrying out espionage on behalf of foreign intelligence.

They were paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nAt a press conference, the spokesman for the National Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Przemys\u0142aw Nowak, said that, during questioning, the suspects \u201cconfessed to most of the acts covered by the charges\u201d, reports news website Onet.\n\nThe latest case closely fits the pattern of how Russia has in recent years\u00a0[hired](\u00a0Ukrainian and Belarusian immigrants and refugees](\u00a0in Poland to carry out espionage and sabotage.\n\n\u201cThe behaviours \\[undertaken by the suspects\\] are consistent with the established and well-known modus operandi of Russian intelligence,\u201d writes the ABW, which notes that they were also tasked with putting up posters and creating graffiti.\n\nAfter being arrested this week, Viktorya M., Oleksandr S. and Anton M. were placed in pretrial detention; Sofia Ch. was put in a juvenile facility; and Uladzimir U., who is currently hospitalised, was allowed to remain at liberty due to his poor health but with a ban on leaving the country.\n\nIn recent years, Poland has detained a growing number of individuals and groups found to have been carrying out sabotage and espionage on behalf of Russia.
