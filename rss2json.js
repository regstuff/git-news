Unlike typical coding challenges or Kaggle-style competitions, our benchmark simulates end-to-end ML workflows including:\n\n\\- Dataset handling and preprocessing\n\n\\- Debugging model and code failures\n\n\\- Implementing new model architectures\n\n\\- Fine-tuning and improving existing models\n\nWith 30 diverse tasks, ML-Dev-Bench evaluates agents across critical stages of ML development. To complement this, we built Calipers, a framework that provides systematic performance evaluation and reproducible assessments.\n\nOur experiments with agents like ReAct, Openhands, and AIDE highlighted that current AI solutions still struggle with the complexity of real-world workflows. We believe the community\u2019s expertise is key to driving the next wave of improvements.\n\nWe\u2019re calling on the community to contribute! Whether you have ideas for new tasks, improvements for Calipers, or just want to discuss ways to bridge the gap between current AI agents and practical ML development, we\u2019d love your input. Your contributions can help shape the future of AI in ML development.\n\nRepository here: [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1itva25/mldevbench_benchmarking_agents_on_realworld_ai/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At the 544-mile Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon in 1983, a 61-year-old potato farmer named Cliff Young showed up in overalls and work boots.

Since my Dutch dataset is not annotated, I\u2019m using a small labeled English dataset (around 2500 examples) for fine-tuning and then testing on the Dutch data.\n\nSo far, my best performance is a F1 score of 0.73. I believe the main issue is not the language transfer, but domain adaptation. The English data consists of adults explaining their problems to therapists, while the Dutch data is children posting on a social media forum.\n\nI've tried various approaches (fine-tuning XLM-RoBERTa, adapters, few-shot learning, rewriting English data as a Dutch teenager using LLMs), but I cant seem to go higher than 0.73.\n\nDo you have any ideas or suggestions that I can try to increase my model performance?\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ituehi/help_with_domain_adaptation_for_detecting/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Malaysia: Defence Secretary co-chairs 13th Malaysia-India Defence Cooperation Committee", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/malaysia-defence-secretary-co-chairs-13th-malaysia-india-defence-cooperation-committee20250219142856/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Technology that automatically translates", "summary": "I remember I saw something on Instagram about a technology that was headphones and it would immediately translate what one person said to your language.
