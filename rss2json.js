There may a reset under the new administration but we'll never know, so let's talk about the present. I am trying to note down some points and why they may or may not have caused the friction. Feel free to correct or calibrate me on any of the issue.\n\n#Background\n\nOne of the biggest reasons India and US are \"allies\" is bounded by their common interests. USA doesn't want to see rise of China, so they obviously see India as a counterbalance to China's rising power. India is not a match for China right now, empowered India would be difficult for China to handle as they have multiple fronts to deal with, so obviously USA wants that.\n\nIn light of that, USA has been getting closer to India with QUAD among other things. \n\n#Fallout speculation\n\n##Russia-Ukraine War\n\nUSA wants to isolate Russia completely, so they may not like India continuing the trade with Russia, but I don't see that as a major issue, honestly. Most of the oil India is buying is going to Europe any way. USA knows this. Blinken in his statements have hinted that they are fine with whatever is going between Russia-India-Europe. So that can't cause such a big fallout\n\n##Nijjar-Panun\n\nThis seems to be a big point of contention. Canada did not like Nijjar assassination and they are confident that India did it (Whether India did it or not, does not matter at this point). Similarly with Pannun. But I am not sure why USA would want to antagonise India about this issue. It seems like a minor issue in the scheme of things. Or are they just looking for Canada like a \"big brother\"? Or FiveEyes have bigger fish to fry with India?\n\n##Sheikh Hasina\n\nI am not going to speculate whether \"USA deep state\" was involved in coup against Hasina. It's not relevant to this discussion but what is important is that whatever happened in Bangladesh clearly had the blessings of USA. They have vocally supported Students Movement, Coup, Yunus, remained silent about whatever happened after that at ground level. This however is very late in the game, USA-India relationship was already bad at that point. \n\n##Adani bribe\n\nIt's clear that USA knew the fallout it would cause with India if they went ahead with indictment on this one. FCPA is clearly judicial overreach on the part of USA. Many in USA are not in favour of this law in the first place, so prosecution under FCPA has to be very selective and strategic. Once again, not passing a judgement on whether Adani bribed the officials or not because that's not relevant to the current discussion. \n\nSo these are major events that has tested India-USA relationship but none of them seem significant enough to cause such a big fallout.
