Archaeologist here. A little about me, lest anyone wonder who's bringing this up: My background is in European prehistory, but I'm pivoting into cultural resource management here in the United States. I currently hold a bachelor's and an MPhil. And if you don't want to hear it from me, please at least watch this [excellent John Oliver segment]( before leaving.\n\nAnyway! The sub sidebar states that \"ethics and morality in archaeology\" is a valid topic, so let's talk about it. Every time I've seen someone post about repatriation recently, people in the comments have gone for the pitchforks or made some really odd excuses about why [x] country doesn't have the right to [y] artifact that originated there. There are a couple of things to think about here.\n\n1.) **Archaeology isn't just about objects for their own sake.** None of these items exist in a vacuum. Archaeology is about knowledge of the past, and as either a subfield or sister field of anthropology (depending on which countries' universities you ask), it's also about people.\n\n**Objects have different kinds of value: aesthetic, scientific, emotional. These might be relevant to different groups.** A burnt chunk of cow bone doesn't have aesthetic or emotional value to most, but it might have a lot of scientific value if it has something to say about ancient diets or the history of domestication. A human skeleton has little aesthetic value, but scientific--to archaeologists--and emotional--to any genetic or cultural descendants--might be neck-in-neck. This can be a point of tension if the archaeologists do not belong to that group of genetic or cultural descendants. And a carved stela might not need to be studied in a lab, but it has aesthetic value to museum visitors as a beautiful piece of art, and emotional value to people who see it as a symbol of their culture's history. Etc.\n\n2.) **Archaeology has a dark, embarrassing past.** No field of study is purely objective or without bias, but modern archaeology in the western world sits in a particularly awkward place as a science born *directly* of colonialism. **I often see people talk about how institutions like The British Museum and the The Metropolitan Museum of Art are repositories of shared human culture. But who got to decide that, exactly?** I urge you again to watch the John Oliver segment, as it addresses museums specifically (it is also very funny). The truth is that **archaeology was born from treasure hunting and plundering by colonial powers.** In a global age, as more countries struggle to establish their own identities, we have to remember that. And **we have to be good global citizens.** Sometimes that means taking a step back and thinking about what objects mean to us versus what they mean to other people. Or interrogating the impulse to say \"but we bought that fair and square 250 years ago!\" Discuss!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1fx2npy/lets_talk_about_repatriation/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is SWI-Prolog still common in Computational Linguistics?", "summary": "My professor is super sweet and I like working with him.
