Got too many stupid political comments on a post that wasn't meant to be. \nHere are my views and recommendations on it: \n\n1. If you think geopolitics have no place in major global companies, you are WRONG as it is very much possible in global companies like google, apple etc i can give you many examples to it but i ll list only few and hopefully you ll dyor. Read about what US did with china using huwei, nvdia, tiktok etc. What they did with russia. The most recent example is turkey, read what they are doing with turkey w.r.t kaan's engine.And they can easily do the same with india too. \n\n2. Read the events b/w India-us in recent months. US literally put every economical huddle possible for india. From tarrifs to H1B visa all bad for india and prepare for the worse till we bow down to them(which we don't want to ofc). To add some spice read the statements of US and western politician.\n\n3. Regarding zoho, too many people criticising it with some useless points like they are from rss and they will sell the data. Understand that neither i am saying this will replace everything nor i am saying that all zoho products are great and working but atleast we have got a little something to hold on if incase US decided to rug pull. (Rare but possible like many other events in this decade) . Also, the  post was never about zoho, it was about if we can rely less on US tech if we choose to. You can also bulid some products if you can, i promise i ll appreciate and HYPE it in the same way. \n\n4. For me personally, I am trying aratai now because i want to explore our own options. If it works fine, i ll always have an indian option and that's great right? \n\n5. Support indigenous product and joining the hype is not bad always. Think of two scenarios to get this better hopefully -\na) Without our own defence platforms(Bhramos, akash etc), could we have pulled off Operation Sindoor the same way?\nb) If we had our own S-400s, fighter jets or similar assets, wouldn't the operation have been even more effective?\nYou can think of this in terms of ISRO as well.\n\n6. Last, i would say if you don't understand these basic geopolitics and do nothing about it at your individual level ofc, these things definitely create a huge economically loss for us and the government. And we need finance to run a country so don't cry when government try to cut the losses with a increase in tax. \n\nPeople are welcome to downvote this post as well. Criticise the government and indian policies as much they want. But the truth remains the same that rely completely on US gives an overhand to them which is bad for us hence we need to explore &amp; create indian option asap. \n\nThankyou \ud83e\udee1", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1o1axov/we_need_to_understand_why_we_are_in_need_of/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Training instruct from base", "summary": "Hello,\n\nI'd appreciate pointers to good resources, if they exist, about training a model from the -base version into -instruct.
