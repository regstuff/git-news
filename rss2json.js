Meanwhile, the right-wing opposition largely abstained from voting \u2013 prompting criticism from a coal miners\u2019 union.\n\nPoland is Europe\u2019s most coal-dependent country, with the fossil fuel\u00a0[accounting for 57% of power generation](\u00a0last year. While there has been a gradual shift away from coal, this has been accompanied by concerns about the impact it will have on coal-mining regions.\n\nWhen\u00a0[approving the bill](\u00a0in October, the government said that the measures would \u201cpave the way for a just transition in mining regions\u201d by \u201cproviding real support for thousands of miners\u201d while acting as a \u201cstimulus for investment and development, and the creation of new jobs\u201d.\n\nThe legislation would allow mining companies to decommission mines independently but with state financial backing. They can also transfer such assets as donations to local authorities or state entities, allowing them to be used for investments, revitalisation projects or infrastructure construction.\n\nThe bill would also introduce a package of protective benefits for workers at companies that are closing mines, including severance payments of 170,000 zloty (\u20ac40,000). The plan foresees five mines closing within the next decade and a complete phase-out of thermal coal mining by 2049.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s vote in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, 241 MPs in the 460-seat chamber voted in favour, most of them from the ruling coalition.\n\nOnly six lawmakers voted against it, but 186 abstained, largely from the two main opposition parties, the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) and far-right Confederation (Konfederacja).\n\nThe legislation will now go to the upper-house Senate, where the ruling coalition also holds a majority and which can in any case not block legislation. It must then be signed by opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, who is a strong advocate of coal.\n\nBefore the vote, Confederation MP Witold Tumanowicz, who was among those to abstain, criticised the bill for failing to present an alternative to coal.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that miners must be adequately protected now that we have decided to close the mines,\u201d he said, though adding that \u201cin our view \\[it\\] is a mistake\u201d to close the mines.\n\nHowever, what is now being proposed is simply \u201can attempt to extinguish social conflict\u201d rather than a genuine effort to develop Poland\u2019s energy sector, said Tumanowicz.\n\nPiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski did not take part in the vote at all. But he gave a speech on Thursday \u2013 which was Poland\u2019s annual Miners\u2019 Day, known as\u00a0*Barb\u00f3rka*\u00a0\u2013 in which he condemned \u201canti-mining propaganda\u201d and declared that coal \u201chas a future because it is cheap energy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all miners to believe in the future and that their hard work will continue,\u201d said Kaczy\u0144ski, during a meeting with miners. \u201cWe will do everything to ensure that it continues.\u201d\n\nHowever, the opposition\u2019s decision not to support the bill was met with criticism from Poland\u2019s biggest trade union, Solidarity, which represents many coal miners.\n\n\u201cEvery MP who voted against this bill or abstained acted extremely irresponsibly,\u201d said Dominik Kolorz, head of Solidarity in the\u00a0Silesian-D\u0105browa region, home to many coal mines.\n\n\u201cThe MPs knew perfectly well that, if this bill didn\u2019t come into force by the end of the year, coal companies would face bankruptcy,\u201d he added, accusing them of putting their party interests first.\n\nIt remains unclear whether, once the bill is sent to him by parliament, Nawrocki will sign it into law or exercise his right to veto it \u2013 as he has done with many government bills.\n\nIn a message to miners on Thursday, the president repeated one of his campaign slogans from earlier this year: that Poland must \u201cmine, extract and develop\u201d coal.\n\nWhile standing for election, Nawrocki called coal Poland\u2019s \u201cblack gold\u201d and said that he \u201ccannot imagine closing Polish mines\u201d until\u00a0Poland has a nuclear power plant. The country is preparing to build its first reactor, now expected to come online in 2036.\n\n\u201cYou have the right to employment stability,\u201d Nawrocki told union members at the Bielszowice mine and Huta Pok\u00f3j steelworks in January. He added, however, that if miners \u201creach an agreement with the government, after reviewing these documents, you can certainly count on my support\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s mining sector has been struggling in recent years. Polish coal is among the\u00a0[most expensive in the world](\u00a0to get out of the ground. Burning it causes significant emissions that bring costs under the EU Emissions Trading System.\n\nEurostat data show that Polish households have the\u00a0[EU\u2019s third-most expensive electricity]( when taking countries\u2019 costs of living into account.\n\nBut Poland\u2019s coal industry \u2013 with its long history and powerful unions \u2013 has long enjoyed political influence and public support.
