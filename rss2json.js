I'm here to ask for advice on how to pivot into a career involving NLP considering my background. I earned a non-STEM degree many years ago and am currently an AI enthusiast who runs my own AI server and spends a lot of time learning about AI (Especially GenAI and NLP). What I'm most confused about is what constitutes being 'job-ready'. I've spent hours researching this topic and thought I would come here to see what you think. **Q:** Should I pursue a self-study path or go back to school for a specific degree? Do I stack online self-study courses or enroll in a university? What university degree would you say is the most useful for work in NLP?\n\nI'm going to share a little bit about my background, what I've done that's AI-related, what I'm currently doing, and what I think I need to study next. \n\n**Background:**\n\n* I completed a non-STEM degree many years ago and I work in IT. In other words I do have some level of technical capability but not CS or Data Science level. \n\n**What I've done that's AI-related:**\n\n* I've learned basic Python via online courses from sites like Coursera.\n* I've spent dozens if not hundreds of hours of self-study gaining an understanding of how AI works, especially Generative AI. Not CS level but I can explain various concepts. \n* I have a home lab which includes a Linux server running LLM models I've downloaded. I basically have my own private AI server at home. \n\n**What I'm currently doing:**\n\n* I'm currently enrolled in an AI engineering boot camp focused on RAG for LLMs and enjoy the material. \n* I want to learn RAG so I can feed the aforementioned private 'GPT' my own data and use it for information retrieval. \n* I use Generative AI very heavily for search (Perplexity) and LLMs like ChatGPT as a form of personal tutor and general research on a topic. \n\n**What I think I need to study next:**\n\n* Data structures and algorithms\n* More Python\n* APIs\n* Practical tools like NLTK, PyTorch etc\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and I look forward to reading any advice or recommendations you may have on this subject of a career pivot.
