I aimed to define every project requirement before development, including the tech stack, goals, and features, then breaking features into a hierarchy: Feature (high-level functionality), File (code location), Function (code purpose), Variable (data used), Code (implementation), and Implementation Logic (step-by-step flow). \n\nEvery entity, element, and relationship is detailed, with variable names and purposes defined. This enables test development for a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. \n\nNext, I planned how to divide work among AI agents by pre-planning prompts for each. Inspired by YouTube\u2019s Project Requirements Prompts (PRP), which break PRDs into AI tasks, I developed a Pre-Development Planning Workflow (PDPW). This combines PRD and PRP but goes deeper.

It is our duty as scientists to ensure we leave them with the best possible environment.\u201d\n\nAiden said that the new material is as strong as petroleum-based products but breaks down into its original components when exposed to salt. Those components can then be further processed by naturally occurring bacteria, thereby avoiding generating microplastics that can harm aquatic life and enter the food chain.\n\nAs salt is also present in soil, a piece about five centimetres (two inches) in size disintegrates on land after over 200 hours, he added. \n\nThe material can be used like regular plastic when coated, and the team are focusing their current research on the best coating methods.

I have it running in a Kubernetes cluster and use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. I've also got an OpenTelemetry Collector configured, and I can see the standard http.server.requests and http.server.duration metrics coming through, which is great.\n\nHowever, I'm aiming to create a comprehensive Grafana dashboard to track **LLM token usage** (input/output tokens) and more specific **model inference metrics** (like inference time per model, or total tokens per conversation/user).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Does Open WebUI expose these token usage or detailed inference metrics directly (e.g., via OpenTelemetry, a Prometheus endpoint, or an internal API endpoint)?\n2. If not directly exposed, is there a recommended way or **tooling** I could leverage to extract or calculate these metrics from Open WebUI for external monitoring? For instance, are there existing APIs or internal mechanisms within Open WebUI that could provide this data, allowing me to build a custom exporter or sidecar?\n3. Are there any best practices or existing community solutions for monitoring LLM token consumption and performance from Open WebUI in Grafana?\n\nUltimately, my goal is to visualize token consumption and model performance insights in Grafana.
