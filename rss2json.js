Like all other teams, we have been extensively leveraging GenAI and prompt engineering to make our lives easier. In a past life, I used to teach at Universities and still love to create online content.\n\nSomething I noticed was that while there are tons of courses out there on GenAI/Prompt Engineering, they seem to be a bit dry especially for absolute beginners. Here is my attempt at making learning Gen AI and Prompt Engineering a little bit fun by extensively using animations and simplifying complex concepts so that anyone can understand.\n\nPlease feel free to take this free course (1000 coupons expires April 19 2025) that I think will be a great first step towards an AI engineer career for absolute beginners.\n\nPlease remember to leave a rating, as ratings matter a lot :)\n\n**Link (including free coupon):**  \n[**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jyurtt/ive_created_a_free_course_to_make_genai_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India Eyes Wrapping Key Aspects of US Trade Talks in Six Weeks - Bloomberg", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/india-eyes-wrapping-key-aspects-of-us-trade-talks-in-six-weeks?srnd=phx-india-v2", "author": "None"}, {"title": "deep research sucks", "summary": "I've been using deep research for quite some time now, and there's 3 fundamental problems I see with it:\n\n1. search results are non-trivially irrelevant or plain wrong, they most notably uses Microsoft Bing API\n2. the graph node exploration is more depth-first, then change direction, than a wide research exploration\n3. it is not tied to one\u2019s research objective, not constrained by your current learning/understanding\n\nIf anything OpenAI has built extended search capabilities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jz6zzb/deep_research_sucks/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Tutorial on GitHub - Build an AI Agent with MCP", "summary": "This tutorial walks you through: Building your own MCP server with real tools (like crypto price lookup) Connecting it to Claude Desktop and also creating your own custom agent Making the agent reason when to use which tool, execute it, and explain the result what's inside:\n\n* Practical Implementation of MCP from Scratch\n* End-to-End Custom Agent with Full MCP Stack\n* Dynamic Tool Discovery and Execution Pipeline\n* Seamless Claude 3.5 Integration\n* Interactive Chat Loop with Stateful Context\n* Educational and Reusable Code Architecture\n\nLink to the tutorial:\n\n[\n\nenjoy :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jyzvsj/new_tutorial_on_github_build_an_ai_agent_with_mcp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh's Yunus Angers India During China Visit With 'Landlocked Sisters\u2019 Remark", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MLzMrxAqo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "18th Century Indian Chess Set", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyym4x", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Google\u2019s Viral Prompt Engineering Whitepaper: A Game-Changer for AI Users", "summary": "In April 2025, Google released a\u00a0[69-page prompt engineering guide](\u00a0that\u2019s making headlines across the tech world.

Sequential Guidelines:\n    - Start when user says \"begin\" with Part 1\n    - Provide next part when user says \"next\"\n    - Maintain context from previous parts\n    - Keep consistent terminology throughout\n    - Build upon concepts progressively\n    - Track which part was last provided\n    - Alert user when reaching final part\n    \n    Remember to:\n    - Engage through interactive elements\n    - Support visual learning preferences\n    - Guide clear learning progression\n    - Verify understanding regularly\n    - Adapt depth based on responses\n    - Maintain clear concept connections\n    \n    Begin all interactions by asking the user to provide their topic and say \"begin\" to start the sequential process. Start each content section with \"Let's explore this part of [topic] in detail!\" and maintain an engaging, educational tone throughout.\n\n**&lt;prompt.architect&gt;**\n\nTrack development:\u00a0[\n\n\\[Build: TA-231115\\]\n\n**&lt;/prompt.architect&gt;**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jyu778/chatgpt_study_path_generator_learn_anything_faster/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indian fugitive accused in nearly $2 bln bank fraud arrested in Belgium, source says | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-fugitive-involved-2-bln-bank-fraud-arrested-belgium-source-says-2025-04-14/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Based on Google's prompt engineering whitepaper, made this custom GPT to create optimized prompts", "summary": "[\n\nYou can find the original whitepaper here: [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jyyn69/based_on_googles_prompt_engineering_whitepaper/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Coding with Verbs: A Prompting Thesaurus", "summary": "Hey r/PromptEngineering \ud83d\udc4b \ud83c\udf0a \n\nI'm a Seattle-based journalist and editor recently laid off in March, now diving into the world of language engineering. \n\nI wanted to share \"Actions: A Prompting Thesaurus,\" a resource I created that emphasizes verbs as key instructions for AI models\u2014similar to functions in programming languages.

Building agents and make them work in either a workflow or self reasoning flow has been a challenging and exciting experience. Throughout my projects I\u2019ve used Autogen, langraph and recently Semantic Kernel.\n\nI\u2019m coming to think all of these libraries are just tech debt now. \nWhy?\n1. The abstractions were not built for the kind of capabilities we have today lang chain and lang graph are the worst. Auto gen is OK, but still, unnecessary abstractions. \n2. It gets very difficult to move between designs. As an engineer, I\u2019m used to coding using SOLID principles, DRY and what not. Moving algorithm logic to another algorithm would be a cakewalk until the contracts don\u2019t change. Here it\u2019s different, agent to agent communication - once setup are too rigid. Imagine you want to change a system prompt to squash agents together ( for performance ) - if you vanilla coded the flow, it\u2019s easy, if you used a framework, the Squashing is unnecessarily complex.\n3. The models are getting so powerful that I could increase my boundary of separate of concerns. For example, requirements, user stories etc etc agents could become a single business problem related agent. My point is models are kind of getting Agentic themselves.\n4. The libraries were not built for the world of LLMs today. CoT is baked into reasoning model, reflection? Yea that too. And anyway if you want to do anything custom you need to diverge \n\nI can speak a lot more going into more project related details but I feel folks need to evaluate before diving into these frameworks.\n\nAgain this is just my opinion , we can have a healthy debate :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jz8glg/stopped_using_autogen_langgraph_semantic_kernel/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gaza territory shrinks drastically as Israel seizes huge swaths of land", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/g-s1-59633/gaza-buffer-zone-israel-military", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tiny cut marks on animal bone fossils reveal that human ancestors were in Romania 1.95 million years ago", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-04-tiny-animal-bone-fossils-reveal.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Why the US can devastate everyone and still emerge stronger", "summary": "", "link": "https://theprint.in/opinion/why-the-us-can-devastate-everyone-and-still-emerge-stronger/2589013/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "This size of this longhouse suggests powerful rulers existed in Norway long before the Viking Age", "summary": "Excerpts:\n\nTwo years ago, archaeologists excavated a field at Sem in Eastern Norway.
