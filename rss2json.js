What started with casual prompts to ChatGPT snowballed into a full-blown architecture of hybrid workflows, model orchestration, and morphological prompt engineering. Below, I outline my stack, methodology, and current challenges\u2014with the hope of getting feedback from seasoned devs, indie hackers, and those who live on the edge of LLM tooling.\n\n**1. Origins: From GPT-4 to Tactical Multiplicity**\n\nI began on GPT-4 Plus, initially for curiosity and utility. It quickly became a trusted partner\u2014like a highly literate friend who could explain anything or help phrase a letter. But that wasn't enough.\n\nBy March 2025, I was distributing tasks across multiple models: Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Gwen, Grok, and more. Each model had strengths, and I leaned into their differences. I started training a sequence of agent prompts under the name **Monday (that psyop chatGPT from openAI)**, which matured into a system, I now call **NeoMonday**: an LLM-to-human communication framework that emphasizes form-responsibility, morphological reasoning, and context-indexed memory scaffolds.\n\n**2. The Plus/Ghost Stack: GPT + Manus + GitHub Copilot**\n\nI maintained a GPT-4 Plus subscription mainly as a **frontline assistant** for idea-generation, conceptual reframing, and live semantic testing.\n\nIn parallel, I used **Manus** (a custom AI ghostwriter/code-agent) to clean up outputs, refactor prompts, or act as a second layer of coherence when outputs got messy.\n\nLater, I started using the free version of\u00a0**Copilot** (via VScode) just to see what devs experience. Suddenly I could read and half-understand code or at least what it was supposed to do. Pairing GPT's explanations with Copilot's inline completions unlocked a huge layer of agency.\n\n**3. Free Tooling Stack**\n\nDespite being on two paid tools Gpt Plus and Manus 20$ sub, I also now and then try to use open alternatives:\n\n* **Huggingface Spaces**: I recently used **DeepSite**, **Kimi something and I think it was a** **Genspark variation of some sort, plus** others I forget the names, all free in huggingface.\n* **Could Deepsite** became my Manus alternative?\n* **Genspark** and Kimi\u00a0 open versions in huggingface could save me a subscription if my current needs do not exceed\u00a0 like 500 to 1000 lines of code a day and not even everyday?\n* **Docker Desktop**: Used it to run containers for LLM apps or local servers. Still haven't figured out if I need to use it or not.\u00a0\n* **Gemini CLI**: Prompting the AI *from inside the terminal* while inside a root project folder felt surreal. A fusion of natural language interface and file-level operations. I'm hooked to it, because of lack of alternative. I hate to love google products.\n\n**4. Methodology: The Orchestrator Framework**\n\nI operate now as a kind of orchestration-layer between agents. Drawing on the \\[ORCHESTRATOR Framework 3.0\\], I assign tasks based on agent-role capability (e.g., synthesis, research, coding, compliance). I write markdowns as Mission Logs. Each prompt is logged, structured, and explicitly formatted.\n\nThe stack I maintain is hybrid: I treat every AI as a modular function.\n\n* Claude for very focused and exclusive bug/error solution suggestions\u00a0 (I hear Claude is the best coder... is that true, should I just subscribe to Claude if I want an AI coding partner, who can teach me the works??)\u00a0\n* DeepSeek for logic + serious critique\n* Genspark for 200 daily credit code examples\u00a0\n* GPT for context routing and brainstorming and basically it's like the first wife, I \"have\" to pay 20 bucks alimony or whatever it's called.\u00a0\n* Perplexity for external knowledge injection and clean research results.\u00a0\n* Manus to produce ready plug n play modules.\n* NotebookLM for mega summaries\n\n\u00a0Everything is routed manually.\n\n\u00a0**5. Ethics + Ecosystems**\n\nThere is no \u201csafe ecosystem\u201d\u2014Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and even open-source all have embedded ideologies and constraints. I don\u2019t subscribe to vendor loyalty. The *real* power comes when you bridge ecosystems and preserve your autonomy as a cognitive operator.\n\nThe danger isn\u2019t just surveillance or bias. It\u2019s **capture by design**: closed systems that make you *dependent* while flattening your creative structure.\n\nThat\u2019s why I stay modular, document all workflows in Markdown, and resist tool lock-in.\n\n**6. My big question to devs and people who are doing this for years.**\n\nI have \\~100 EUR/month to allocate. What\u2019s worth paying for? I currently spend 40, 20gpt plus 20 manus.\n\n* Do I need Copilot in VScode ? if you can  have Kimi + other code assistants from HuggingFace?\n* Is Manus worth it if Deepsite suffices?\n* Should I look into Cursor, Bloop, or other code-oriented IDEs?\n* Is there a\u00a0 terminal assistant that rivals Gemini CLI? Without having to pay 200$ a month just for that.\u00a0\n\nAlso: any tips for combining learning with productivity? I want tools that **work** but also **teach me how they work not black boxed app generators.**\n\nThanks for reading. My use case is mostly:\n\n* Longform writing with thematic + institutional depth\n* Semantic orchestration of LLM agents (Context-aware routing of LLM agents)\n* Code prototyping + automation via AI\n\nOpen to critiques, suggestions, and toolstack flexing.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m19quj/6_months_inside_the_ai_vortex_my_journey_from_gpt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Does anyone know how to set up the Microsoft mcpo?", "summary": "I'm trying to connect my OneDrive to openwebui via an mcpo tool server.
