But there\u2019s another silent cost on every international flight: overflight fees.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 What are overflight fees?\nWhenever a plane crosses a country\u2019s airspace, it has to pay that country\u2019s aviation authority. The amount depends on the aircraft\u2019s weight and the distance flown in that airspace.\n\u2013 Even if the plane doesn\u2019t land there, just passing through the skies costs money.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Why is this important for India?\n\t\u2022\tIndia sits between Europe and Southeast Asia/Australia. Almost every Europe\u2013SE Asia flight crosses Indian skies.\n\t\u2022\tAirlines flying from the Middle East to East Asia also pass over us.\n\t\u2022\tThis means India earns huge passive revenue just from geography.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Global context:\n\t\u2022\tRussia makes billions annually from overflight fees, since Europe\u2013Asia routes often need to cross Russian airspace.\n\t\u2022\tWhen Russia banned EU airlines after the Ukraine war, flights had to detour thousands of extra kilometers, burning more fuel and paying higher costs.\n\t\u2022\tSimilarly, if India ever adjusted its fee structure, it could massively impact international flight economics.\n\nIn short: India\u2019s airspace is like prime real estate. Airlines can\u2019t avoid it without paying extra in fuel and time, which is why overflight fees are a hidden but powerful source of revenue.\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 should India raise these fees to capitalize more, or keep them moderate to stay airline-friendly?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1ncchvt/overflight_fees_how_airlines_pay_countries_just/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spain intensifies criticism of Israeli offensive in Gaza.
