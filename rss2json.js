This change is picked up by other clients, disabling voting and showing results.\n5. **Poll Deletion:**\n   * User confirms deletion.\n   * The app first queries for all proposal nodes linked to the votingSession.\n   * Each proposal node is removed using db.remove(proposalId).\n   * The main votingSession node is removed using db.remove(sessionId).\n   * UI updates to reflect the deletion.\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 Potential Future Enhancements\n\n* Explicit P2P peer connection setup for true multi-device/browser sync.\n* User authentication/identity (e.g., using cryptographic key pairs) for more robust \"vote once\" mechanisms and poll ownership.\n* Editing existing polls.\n* More advanced query/filtering for polls.\n* Storing vote attributions (who voted for what, if privacy allows).\n* Improved UI/UX with a dedicated frontend framework.\n\n# \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Setup &amp; Running\n\n1. Clone this repository (or just save the HTML file).\n2. Open the [your-filename].html file in a modern web browser.\n   * To test real-time updates easily, open the same poll link in two different tabs or windows of the *same browser*.\n\nThat's it! No build steps or complex dependencies are needed for this basic version.\n\n# License\n\nThis example project is for demonstration purposes. If based on a specific repository, refer to its license.
