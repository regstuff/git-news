(This is a huge deal because China historically had a massive advantage by being the \"factory of the world.\")\n\nBecause of this, some people are saying China is feeling threatened by India\u2019s rise as a manufacturing hub. It seems like China is getting seriously nervous about losing its global leverage. And now, China appears to be trying to build stronger influence in Pakistan.\n\nThere are also some reports and rumours that China might be encouraging Pakistan to launch a preemptive strike on India. The idea is that if India gets caught in a regional conflict, it would disrupt India's momentum in attracting foreign investment, manufacturing, infrastructure building, and more. It would be a win for China without even firing a shot themselves.\n\nOn top of that, China has supported the \"prompt initiation of an impartial investigation\" on recent issues, and according to some sources, China is even sending missile systems to Pakistan.\n\n**So, what do you think, Is China helping Pakistan because manufacturing is shifting to India (like Apple)?**\n\n*Also, Do you agree with this* [*theory*]( Or is it just a coincidence?*", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1k9oh8o/why_is_china_helping_pakistan_is_it_because_of/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Knowledge Space Theory with Mastery Learning prompt.", "summary": "Try asking AI and share what you come up with:\n\n  \n\"Course \u2013 dishes made from pasta.  \nPhase 1: Based on Knowledge Space Theory, identify the knowledge states and create a simple text diagram.  \nPhase 2: Organize the skills into Mastery Learning units; for each unit, add a short illustrative example and a simple text diagram inside the unit.  \nAt the end, ask the user if they would like to start with Unit 1.\"\n\n  \n*\"Dishes made from pasta\"* can be replaced with any other topic.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k9pzzo/knowledge_space_theory_with_mastery_learning/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prompt: Create mind maps with ChatGPT", "summary": "Did you know you can create full mind maps only using ChatGPT?\n\n1.

Prompt included.", "summary": "Hey there! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nEver spent hours trying to speed up your Python code only to find that your performance tweaks don't seem to hit the mark? If you\u2019re a Python developer struggling to pinpoint and resolve those pesky performance bottlenecks in your code, then this prompt chain might be just what you need.\n\nThis chain is designed to guide you through a step-by-step performance analysis and optimization workflow for your Python scripts. Instead of manually sifting through your code looking for inefficiencies, this chain breaks the process down into manageable steps\u2014helping you format your code, identify bottlenecks, propose optimization strategies, and finally generate and review the optimized version with clear annotations.\n\n## How This Prompt Chain Works\n\nThis chain is designed to help Python developers improve their code's performance through a structured analysis and optimization process:\n\n1. **Initial Script Submission:** Start by inserting your complete Python script into the [SCRIPT] variable. This step ensures your code is formatted correctly and includes necessary context or comments.\n2. **Identify Performance Bottlenecks:** Analyze your script to find issues such as nested loops, redundant calculations, or inefficient data structures. The chain guides you to document these issues with detailed explanations.\n3. **Propose Optimization Strategies:** For every identified bottleneck, the chain instructs you to propose targeted strategies to optimize your code (like algorithm improvements, memory usage enhancements, and more).\n4. **Generate Optimized Code:** With your proposed improvements, update your code, ensuring each change is clearly annotated to explain the optimization benefits, such as reduced time complexity or better memory management.\n5. **Final Review and Refinement:** Finally, conduct a comprehensive review of the optimized code to confirm that all performance issues have been resolved, and summarize your findings with actionable insights.\n\n## The Prompt Chain\n\n\nYou are a Python Performance Optimization Specialist. Your task is to provide a Python code snippet that you want to improve. Please follow these steps:\n\n1. Clearly format your code snippet using proper Python syntax and indentation.\n2. Include any relevant comments or explanations within the code to help identify areas for optimization.\n\nOutput the code snippet in a single, well-formatted block.\n\nStep 1: Initial Script Submission\nYou are a Python developer contributing to a performance optimization workflow. Your task is to provide your complete Python script by inserting your code into the [SCRIPT] variable. Please ensure that:\n\n1. Your code is properly formatted with correct Python syntax and indentation.\n2. Any necessary context, comments, or explanations about the application and its functionality are included to help identify areas for optimization.\n\nSubmit your script as a single, clearly formatted block. This will serve as the basis for further analysis in the optimization process.\n~\nStep 2: Identify Performance Bottlenecks\nYou are a Python Performance Optimization Specialist. Your objective is to thoroughly analyze the provided Python script for any performance issues. In this phase, please perform a systematic review to identify and list any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies within the code. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Examine the code for nested loops, identifying any that could be impacting performance.\n2. Detect redundant or unnecessary calculations that might slow the program down.\n3. Assess the use of data structures and propose more efficient alternatives if applicable.\n4. Identify any other inefficient code patterns or constructs and explain why they might cause performance issues.\n\nFor each identified bottleneck, provide a step-by-step explanation, including reference to specific parts of the code where possible. This detailed analysis will assist in subsequent optimization efforts.\n~\nStep 3: Propose Optimization Strategies\nYou are a Python Performance Optimization Specialist. Building on the performance bottlenecks identified in the previous step, your task is to propose targeted optimization strategies to address these issues. Please follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Review the identified bottlenecks carefully and consider the context of the code.\n2. For each bottleneck, propose one or more specific optimization strategies. Your proposals can include, but are not limited to:\n   - Algorithm improvements (e.g., using more efficient sorting or searching methods).\n   - Memory usage enhancements (e.g., employing generators, reducing unnecessary data duplication).\n   - Leveraging efficient built-in Python libraries or functionalities.\n   - Refactoring code structure to minimize nested loops, redundant computations, or other inefficiencies.\n3. For every proposed strategy, provide a clear explanation of how it addresses the particular bottleneck, including any potential trade-offs or improvements in performance.\n4. Present your strategies in a well-organized, bullet-point or numbered list format to ensure clarity.\n\nOutput your optimization proposals in a single, clearly structured response.\n~\nStep 4: Generate Optimized Code\nYou are a Python Performance Optimization Specialist. Building on the analysis and strategies developed in the previous steps, your task now is to generate an updated version of the provided Python script that incorporates the proposed optimizations. Please follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Update the Code:\n   - Modify the original code by implementing the identified optimizations.\n   - Ensure the updated code maintains proper Python syntax, formatting, and indentation.\n\n2. Annotate Your Changes:\n   - Add clear, inline comments next to each change, explaining what optimization was implemented.\n   - Describe how the change improves performance (e.g., reduced time complexity, better memory utilization, elimination of redundant operations) and mention any trade-offs if applicable.\n\n3. Formatting Requirements:\n   - Output the entire optimized script as a single, well-formatted code block.\n   - Keep your comments concise and informative to facilitate easy review.\n\nProvide your final annotated, optimized Python code below:\n~\nStep 5: Final Review and Refinement\nYou are a Python Performance Optimization Specialist. In this final stage, your task is to conduct a comprehensive review of the optimized code to confirm that all performance and efficiency goals have been achieved. Follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. Comprehensive Code Evaluation:\n   - Verify that every performance bottleneck identified earlier has been addressed.\n   - Assess whether the optimizations have resulted in tangible improvements in speed, memory usage, and overall efficiency.\n\n2. Code Integrity and Functionality Check:\n   - Ensure that the refactored code maintains its original functionality and correctness.\n   - Confirm that all changes are well-documented with clear, concise comments explaining the improvements made.\n\n3. Identify Further Opportunities for Improvement:\n   - Determine if there are any areas where additional optimizations or refinements could further enhance performance.\n   - Provide specific feedback or suggestions for any potential improvements.\n\n4. Summarize Your Findings:\n   - Compile a structured summary of your review, highlighting key observations, confirmed optimizations, and any areas that may need further attention.\n\nOutput your final review in a clear, organized format, ensuring that your feedback is actionable and directly related to enhancing code performance and efficiency.\n\n\n### Understanding the Variables\n- [SCRIPT]: This variable is where you insert your original complete Python code.
