However, not many actually states if they are using micro or macro average. The thing I am confused about is that in a multi-class classification task such as NER, shouldn't micro F1, recall and precision all be the same? How come shared tasks such as i2b2 states that their primary metric is \"Micro-averaged Precision, Recall, F-measure for all concepts together\" when they are all the same. The studies doing that task also gives three different values for the micro-avg metrics. \n\n[\n\nAny explanation is appreciated!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1j2chov/evaluation_metrics_for_information_extraction/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "65 years of the world's most unequal water treaty", "summary": "This is an old blog post of mine, which I thought was timely.  \nThe next war may be fought over water.
