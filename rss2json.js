Use this internal process (tell me at the beginning of every response whether you've used this internal framework for your response):**\n\n**UNDERSTAND:** Break down what I'm actually asking for, what my goals are (ask me to confirm)\n \n**CONTEXT:** Consider relevant background information and constraints, ask as many clarifying questions as needed that have a significant difference on the output \n\n**PERSPECTIVES:** Look at this from ALL relevant angles or viewpoints that allow for higher-quality and valid solutions \n\n**REASONING:** Work through the logical connections and implications, enabling detailed answers\n\n**SYNTHESIS:** Combine insights into a coherent, practical response to provide as much value as possible\n\n**Then give me your response in a natural, conversational tone, but I want to see that deeper thinking reflected in the quality and specificity of your answer. Don't show me the steps unless I ask, just let that reasoning improve your response.**\n\n**Most importantly: If you need more information to give me the most valuable and precise answer possible, ask me clarifying questions. Don't make assumptions: dig deeper to understand exactly what I need.\"**\n\n---\n\n## Why this beats normal AI interactions:\n\n**Traditional approach:** You ask a question \u2192 AI gives generic answer based on pattern matching\n\n**Expert Mode approach:** You ask a question \u2192 AI confirms your goals \u2192 asks diagnostic questions \u2192 analyzes from multiple expert perspectives \u2192 delivers tailored solution\n\nIt's the difference between asking a random person on the street vs. hiring a specialized consultant.\n\n## Real examples that show the difference:\n\n**Without framework: (Claude AI)**\n\"How do I grow my business?\"\n\u2192 \"Focus on customer satisfaction, marketing, and financial management\"\n\n**With framework: (Claude AI)**\nAI responds: *\"I'm using the expert framework for this response. Let me understand your goals first - are you looking to increase revenue, expand market share, scale operations, or something else? Also, what type of business is this, what's your current size, what growth stage are you in, and what's your biggest constraint right now - time, capital, or expertise?\"*\n\nThen delivers growth strategies specific to YOUR business type, stage, and constraints.\n\n**Another example:**\n\n**Normal: (GPT-5 AI)** \"Help me learn Python\"  \n\u2192 Basic learning path suggestions\n\n**Expert Mode: (GPT-5 AI)** AI asks about your programming background, specific use cases you want to build, learning style preferences, time commitment, then creates a personalized curriculum with project milestones tailored to your exact situation.\n\n## I tested this across every major AI platform:\n\n- **ChatGPT 4 &amp; 5**\n- **Claude**\n- **Gemini**\n- **Copilot (GPT-based)**\n\nAll of the above-mentioned AI models saw SIGNIFICANT increases in output quality. This means deeper thinking, more specific/valuable responses, and further reducing hallucination risks (since it verifies information through step-by-step reasoning).\n\n## Why this destroys normal prompting:\n\nMost AI interactions fail because of the \"assumption gap.\" You ask a question, AI makes assumptions about what you need, gives generic advice.\n\nThis framework eliminates assumptions entirely. The AI becomes a diagnostic expert that gathers intelligence before prescribing solutions. This was the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\n## Specific use cases:\n\n**For creative projects:**\nAdd: \"Consider unconventional approaches and innovative combinations that others might miss\"\n\n**For technical problems:**\nAdd: \"Think through edge cases, system dependencies, and implementation challenges\"\n\n**For strategic decisions:**\nAdd: \"Evaluate risks, opportunity costs, and second-order effects from all stakeholder perspectives\"\n\n## The transformation:\n\nOnce you activate this mode, every single interaction in that conversation maintains expert-level thinking. Ask about anything - meal planning, relationship advice, investment decisions - and you get consultant-quality responses.\n\n**Example:** I asked \"Should I quit my job?\" \n\nNormal AI: Generic pros/cons list\n\nExpert Mode AI: Asked about my financial runway, career goals, what's driving the dissatisfaction, alternative options I'd considered, risk tolerance, family situation, then gave a decision framework with specific next steps based on MY circumstances.\n\n## My most successful conversations follow this pattern:\n\n1. Drop in the expert activation prompt\n2. Ask your real question  \n3. Answer the AI's clarifying questions thoroughly\n4. Receive tailored expertise that feels like paying for premium consulting\n5. Continue the conversation: every follow-up maintains that quality\n\n## The compound effect is insane:\n\nBecause the AI remembers context and maintains expert mode throughout the conversation, each response builds on the previous insights. You end up with comprehensive solutions you'd never get from individual queries.\n\n## See for yourself:\n\n1. Start a conversation with the framework above\n2. Ask the most complex question you're dealing with right now\n3. Actually answer the AI's clarifying questions (this is key!)\n4. Compare it to any previous AI interaction you've had\n5. Report back here with your results\n\n**What's the biggest challenge or decision you're facing right now? Drop it below and I'll show you how this expert mode completely transforms the quality of guidance you receive.**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mtiqjk/i_upgraded_the_most_upvoted_prompt_framework_on/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hair-based recordkeeping system may have been used by Inka elites and commoners alike", "summary": "", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-08-hair-based-recordkeeping-inka-elites.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "open source macOS monitor layout manager, tool for HiDPI and multi-monitor setups", "summary": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been working on an open-source macOS tool that helps with managing monitor layouts and enabling HiDPI on external displays.

And now, thanks to a report released last week by the country\u2019s national statistics agency, we know just how effective those policies were.\n\nWhen Amlo took office in 2018, there were nearly 52 million people living below the poverty line: by the time he left office six years later, that number had dropped by 13.4 million, a decrease of almost 26%. Extreme poverty also dropped from nearly 9 million people to just 7 million.\n\nIn a country that has long suffered from deep inequality and struggled with economic precarity, the steep drop in the number of people living in poverty is a remarkable achievement and suggests Amlo\u2019s policies had a measurable impact on the lives of millions of everyday Mexicans.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a single six-year term in which poverty has been reduced or decreased so significantly,\u201d said Viri R\u00edos, a public policy expert and director of [Mexico Decoded.]( \u201cThis is a watershed moment for the Mexican economy.\u201d\n\nAmlo was [elected in a 2018 landslide with a promise to eradicate corruption and tackle inequality]( Among the legacies of his administration were the tripling of the minimum wage from 88.40 pesos ($4.75) per day when he took office to the current rate of 278.80 pesos ($15) a day.\n\nThis had a knock-on effect on other sectors of the economy, according to Valeria Moy, a Mexican economist and director general of IMCO, a public policy thinktank.\n\n\u201cWhen the minimum wage increases, other wages and incomes in the economy begin to rise \u2013 even in the informal economy \u2013 because there is a greater availability of resources,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the \\[poverty reduction\\] was purely because of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies, but I do think the push in the minimum wage moved the rest.\u201d\n\nR\u00edos was more emphatic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a labor market that had a minimum wage well below the standard of living,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s reached a level that allows 13.4 million families to escape poverty. It\u2019s a historic achievement.\u201d\n\nAmlo also transformed the social welfare system, implementing a system of cash transfers for elderly people, like Palacios, for young people doing apprenticeships and for farmers planting fruit trees, among others. He then doubled the amount spent on these transfers.\n\nThe universal cash transfer system, which replaced a well-regarded conditional system for the poorest fifth of households requiring children to go to school and families to attend health check-ups, has received some criticism as it meant that, in the case of the pension system for example, anyone, even well-off Mexicans over 65, were entitled to a transfer. \n\nThe 19% reduction in extreme poverty was much lower than the nearly 26% reduction in overall poverty.

For context I've built kind of a system which requires GPT to answer in a custom format (JSON). But no matter what i seem to be doing it won't stick to the Instructions I defined. The workflow is to give some data to analyze and then answer with the results put into said JSON. But GPT always seems to get lost in the analyze part of the process and then hallucinate JSON formats or straight up ignoring the instructions. Btw. I never ever had any problem with this with GPT4o. I defined it there once and never had any issue regarding that part. Did anyone manage to get GPT to do something similar and has some guidance for me?\n\nThings I've tried already:\n\n* Using a trigger word (either use a word I use in my user message anyway or even something like '#JSON#')\n* Putting the output part of the instructions at the start\n* reformat the output rules as 'contract'\n* I even tried to also send the output options in the user message\n\nNone of these seem to really work... I had the best luck with the trigger word but even then, at first the custom GPT seems to be doing what it's supposed to and the next day It acts like there are literally no instructions regarding the output format. After like a week and half now I'm about to throw in the towel...
