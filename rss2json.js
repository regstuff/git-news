Then, for one of my elective courses, I chose a course that combines NLP with computer vision, studying the relationship between language and vision( A cutting-edge research topic at my university).\nNow I need to choose another course, but none of the options seem particularly appealing to me:\n\n1. Formal Semantics: Propositional Logic, First-Order Logic, Lambda Calculus. In the second part of the course, Syntax and Semantics, Montague Grammar. \n\n      -I know it\u2019s a bit outdated\n\n\n2. Neurolinguistics ( neurobiological foundations of language ): I would choose this mostly for personal interest (I have a background in linguistics).\n\nI  thought it could potentially give me useful knowledge for research, perhaps understanding neurolinguistics well could help improve the language of AI systems (??) or working in NLP applications for clinic applications ( Aphasia, language disorders..) \n\n3. Language Modeling and Cognition: A theoretical course based on studying papers that analyze the capabilities of LLMs. So, you don\u2019t study how to create LLMs, but instead, you read papers on their reasoning abilities, cognitive capabilities, etcc \n\nI know that LLMs are the current standard in NLP, they are very important, but I\u2019m not sure how useful such a theoretical exam really is.\"\n\n\n4. Computational Linguistics and Language-Based Interaction: \nAn NLP course for beginners, covering topics such as linguistic datasets, distributional semantics and vector spaces, neural networks, attention, transformers, machine translation, language models (large language models), and generative models.   \n\nI really liked the idea of this course, but since it is from a different department and is also designed for beginners (like my NLP course), these are topics that I will cover in other courses, both in NLP and in the two ML exams I will take. the only new topics would be machine translation, LLM and maybe trasformers", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fh9s9g/help_me_choose_an_elective_in_nlp/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Paleo-Hebrew seal from the First Temple period discovered in Jerusalem", "summary": "", "link": "https://anatolianarchaeology.net/paleo-hebrew-seal-from-the-first-temple-period-discovered-in-jerusalem/", "author": "None"}, {"title": " A small npm package for generating random usernames", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/muhashi/generate-random-username", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Any curated list of professors/assistant professors working in NLP/Language Technology?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fgu4hz/any_curated_list_of_professorsassistant/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bengali Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews: Traditional Models vs. Llama 3.1 (8b) Fine-Tuning", "summary": "My sentiment analysis project is 98% done and I'm using unsloth and running with LlamaTokenizer with Llama 3.1(8B) model (almost 5 GB)  for the final comparison of accuracy tests as instructed in the task.
