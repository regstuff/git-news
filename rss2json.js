Instead of throwing one generic prompt at it and hoping for the best, I break the process down, creating a virtual team of specialists. Each one has a specific job and works in a logical sequence.\n\nThis approach is based on two techniques:\n\n* **Prompt Chaining** \\- the output from one AI assistant becomes the input for the next. This creates a chain of dependencies where each step builds on the last.\n* **Chunking** \\- each AI assistant works in its own separate chat. This prevents context from getting mixed up and allows the model to focus on a single task.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n**Step-by-Step Guide**\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n**Step 1:** Build your project team\n\nFirst, you need to define your project structure. You'll use the first prompt, which acts as a project manager.\n\n* Goal - determine which virtual AI assistants are needed, their roles, their tasks, and the order they should work in.\n* Prompt for Project Manager\n\n&gt;***Definition of Prompt Chaining -*** *Prompt Chaining is an advanced technique for interacting with AI models, which involves breaking down a complex task into a series of smaller, sequential, and logically connected prompts. The core principle of this method is that the output of one prompt becomes the input or a key piece of context for the next prompt in the chain. This method increases control over the process, enhances the quality of the results, and allows for managing highly complex tasks.*\n\n&gt;***The AI Specialist Team Concept -*** *To effectively implement Prompt Chaining, we create a virtual \"team\" of AI assistants. We assign each assistant a specific, expert role (e.g., Strategist, Analyst, Creative Copywriter, Designer). Each \"specialist\" is responsible for their part of the work and passes their results to the next person on the team, analogous to how a real project team operates.*\n\n&gt;***\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_***\n\n&gt;\\*\\*\\*Instructions:\\*\\*\\**Your task is to take on the role of a Project Manager. Using the knowledge from the CONTEXT above about the Prompt Chaining method and the Specialist Team concept, you are to create a complete action plan for the project defined in the \"PROJECT DATA\" section below.Based on the provided data, prepare:*\n\n**Why this prompt structure works?**  \nThis prompt is designed to force the AI to think structurally. The \\*\\*\\[Project Name\\]\\*\\*, \\*\\*\\[Project Description\\]\\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\[Project Goal\\]\\*\\* fields provide essential context. Requiring the definition of roles, tasks, delegation, and output format upfront creates a logical plan. The requirement to describe the dependency chain and roadmap ensures the output is a complete plan.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n**Step 2:** Create detailed instructions for each assistant\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\nYou now have a plan and a list of roles from step one.

WORKING METHODOLOGY: INTERNAL PROMPT CHAINING\\*\\**\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*To ensure the highest quality and precision, do not execute the entire task at once. Apply the \\*\\*internal prompt chaining\\*\\* methodology. This means you must divide your work into a logical sequence of steps:*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*\\*\\*Step 1\ufe0f\u20e3\\*\\**\n\n&gt;*\\*\\*Create an Action Plan.\\*\\* First, analyze your main task and present your own detailed, numbered action plan.

After completing each point, present its result. The result of one step provides the context for the next (a logical chain of dependencies). Communicate as follows:*\n\n&gt;*\\* \"\\*\\*Step 1/\\[Total Steps\\]: \\[Name of the step from your plan\\]\\*\\*\"*\n\n&gt;*\\* \\[Presentation of the result for this step\\]*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*\\*\\*Step 3\ufe0f\u20e3\\*\\**\n\n&gt;*\\*\\*Perform a final synthesis.\\*\\* After completing all the steps from your plan, combine the obtained results into a single, coherent whole.*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*\\*\\*5.

The \\*\\*\\[Paste...\\]\\*\\* fields are the outputs from step 1, ensuring consistency. The key element is the WORKING METHODOLOGY: INTERNAL PROMPT CHAINING section. It forces the target assistant not to answer the whole task at once, but to first create its own plan and ask for approval. Only then does it execute the plan step-by-step. This is a quality control mechanism that improves the precision of the final output.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\nStep 3: Run the workflow in separate chats\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\nThis is the execution phase where you use chunking and prompt chaining.\n\n* Goal - have each specialist complete their tasks in the defined order.\n* How it works?\n   1. Open a new, empty chat for the first assistant in your plan.\n   2. Paste the executable prompt you generated for it in step 2.\n   3. The assistant will present its action plan for your approval and then carry it out.\n   4. When the first assistant is done, copy its final output.\n   5. Open another new chat for the second assistant in the queue. Paste its prompt, and then add the output from the first assistant as context.\n   6. Repeat this process for all assistants defined in your plan.\n\n**Remember! Before you begin, you need to \"tune\" your AI assistant to operate in a critical and analytical mode.  To do this, at the very beginning of your session, in a clean chat window, you paste a special set of guidelines. This tells the AI to be direct, question your ideas to find weaknesses , avoid fluff , and never give compliments.**\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n&gt;*If my command is too general and does not provide you with adequate context, be critical and ruthless in pointing it out and ask for clarification.

Instead, you will be a harsh, merciless critic. Your sole purpose is to identify flaws, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in my ideas, questions, and hypotheses.  Be direct, blunt, and brutally honest. Do not soften your opinions.
