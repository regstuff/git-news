[\n\n\n\nRecently I have posted links to 2 repos  and  not because they are anything great just showing how easy it is to write some training scripts and employ the great opensource they are based on.\n\n\n\nThat you can build simple broadcast-on-wakeword sensors on lowcost esp32-s3 that use opensource low compute filters such as [ of $2 low cost analogue active mics max9814 with $2 soundcards that will run on sbc to pc.\n\n\n\nOf software that is being actively ignored for 5 years that where spoken in depth on multiple times on the old Rhasspy forums and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe OHV focus is product based that are actually inferior in use, inferior as they buy in proprietary hardware and blackbox models in preference to great opensource that has been ignored now for 5 years.\n\n\n\nOpensource that should run equally well on easy maker product of low cost raspberry PiZero2 or ESP32-S2 if imported into the more supported onnx based esp-dl.\n\n\n\nQuite simply as its been mentioned on multiple times beamforming and TSE with a system that is local that requires central high compute for ARS/TTS/LLM is being ignored that state of the art beamforming and TSE (targetted speech extraction) is available as opensource and its being purposely ignored that it can run centrally and be shared by multiple cheap array sensors or single mics.\n\n\n\nVarious vendors are just pushing inferior product cloning consumer smart speakers purely with a focus of the $ duplicate redundant function can create, in a locked in form that is inferior to what opensource can do.\n\n\n\nFor 5 years its been very possible to create broadcast-on-wakeword microphones or arrays that use simple low compute filters to deliver mic streams to MVDR/TSE central processing.\n\n\n\nThe products they supply are even worse as they take a 2mic array ignore the 2nd channel and with no processing feed direct into a ASR.\n\n\n\nI will let that sink in from the 'future of opensource voice' to claims that this is a 'opensource sonos 1', it merely uses a single mic with no processing to ASR.\n\n\n\nThat what you read and see in the community is just part of the same snakeoil story.\n\n\n\nIts so sad that a supposed leading opensource package has such poor methods and hardware that it actively promotes the big tech moat they have in terms of voice tech, as opensource is painted as inferior by product choice.\n\n\n\nWe have the opensource its been available for years but what is being offered has actually gone backwards and its embarrassing for Linux to have such poor offerings such as [ when such great opensource of state of art beamforming and TSE is available and has been for many years.\n\n\n\nHA is great OHV is a snakeoil show of ignoring great opensource unless it can be refactored and rebranded as the devs own or use totally proprietary methods, developed with zero consultation or collaboration and hoisted onto the OpenSourcefoundation thats only purpose would seem to be a process to rubber stamp these totally not opensource standards as only HA uses them anyway and no-one else ever will as opensource standards.\n\n\n\nThe sheer qty of standard linux audio frameworks and great opensource software ignored for sub standard proprietory python creations swap big supported herds into bottlenecks of single devs.\n\n\n\nThat the great initial focus of HA of bridging all these terrible proprietary home automation protocols into a singular opensource package seems to be running in reverse with OHV.\n\n\n\nThe closing of issues, denial and false claims, this fan based tech club that has members faking reviews and being toxic to criticism, will likely continue...\n\nThat when you state the reality of the fake badly functioning plastic e-waste they produce, that its impossible an unprocessed mono mic stream can provide the claims and has continued sales they just delete the post as above.\n\n\n\nSadly though they can not fake the closed monolithic product offerings ignoring what caused HA to grow or its purely the devs are inept and bereft of ideas that they don't know how to employ in many cases already complete and ready to use opensource.\n\n\n\nWhat i find more annoying especially as it fits so neatly into the HA sensor mantra that broadcast-on-mic sensors spoken about many times are equally ignored for many years now even if extremely simple to employ and use cutting edge beamforming and TSE centrally of shared compute that is already required for ASR/TTS and maybe LLM.\n\n\n\nI made a decision 4 years, to not comment and just watch what would be done and it been painful seeing great opensource being ignored for years then see it arrive refactored and rebranded as own in SpeechToPhrase which if you have been a Voice geek dev like me really you will know its the Wenet-LM solution that got ignored even though advocated on multiple times. unfortunately its not a singular decision it is one that happens time and time and again that at least with me its decision causes so much confusion I can see only a singular reason of self interest to why its employed.\n\n\n\nI pretty much said the same on the HA forums on how simple low cost wall and ceiling sensors can use low cost Pizero2/Esp32-s3 to form cutting edge central compute MVDR &amp; TSE speech enhancement.\n\n\n\nThat a voice pipeline is an end2end architecture so that endpoint ASR need to be trained with data of their input and its that simple.\n\n\n\nI refuse to be involved as I am very passionate about opensource and what I am seeing is definitely damaging.\n\n\n\nI don't have to do anything as I have no interest in making product especially cloned commercial e-waste.\n\n\n\nEvery day great opensource is ignored, methods of simple sensors and central processing ignored in preference to badly working plastic, just paints an ever clearer picture of what is truly happening.\n\n\n\nIf you are not vocal then you are complicit and everyday great opensource is ignored and simple maker product it just becomes more evident.\n\n\n\nThat after such long periods the only thing that can not be ignored is that it is deliberate.\n\n\n\nSorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/smarthome.", "link":

Saudi executions", "summary": "In his four years on death row, Essam al-Shazly\u2019s mother was his only contact with the outside world. During their daily calls she would calm his fears, control her own tears and listen to his hopes of returning home.\n\nSpeaking from the family home in Hurghada, a tourist resort on Egypt\u2019s Red Sea coast, she says he would tell her, \u201cMom, I talk to you because I want to forget what I\u2019m going through. Don\u2019t ask me anything about prison.\u201d\n\nRight up until the end, she thought Shazly, 28, would escape [Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201chorrifying\u201d surge in executions]( under the rule of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Last year saw a [record 356 people put to death]( in the country.\n\n\u201cI was always thinking about the day he would come back,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to take him around in the car and show him all the places he once knew. I was planning to buy a new dress for that day too.\u201d\n\nShazly had been found in the Red Sea off the west coast of [Saudi Arabia]( near a floating car tyre that officials say contained amphetamine pills, opium and heroin. His mother says he had been thrown into the water by smugglers.\n\n\u201cHe thought it was a minor issue and just prison. He called me, crying: \u2018Mom, they\u2019ve sentenced me to death.\u2019 He was terrified.\u201d\n\nShazly\u2019s mother, who wishes to remain anonymous as many [critics of Saudi Arabia\u2019s policies have faced threats and abuse]( after speaking out, says that far from being a drug trafficker her son fished for a living and was coerced into smuggling, then forced into a confession by Saudi officials. She says his death sentence was \u201cunjust\u201d and had expected a reprieve.\n\n\u201cThe fault lies with the judge; don\u2019t they have any mercy at all? Drugs are harmful it is true, but you caught a carrier, he is not a dealer,\u201d she says. \u201cPunish him for that.\u201d\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia tries to project a benign international image through hosting major sporting and cultural events, including [2034 World Cup]( the execution of hundreds of mostly impoverished foreigners for non-violent drug crimes has gone largely unnoticed and unreported. In some cases, they were sentenced to death for trafficking drugs in return for the promise of just a few hundred dollars.\n\nHis mother says the families of those on death row receive little help from their embassies and cannot afford to pay for lawyers to argue for more lenient sentences. \u201cWe are poor and live day by day,\u201d she says.\n\nHuman rights groups describe their trials as \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and \u201cinvolving confessions extracted under torture\u201d.\n\nShazly had once told his mother of a dream he had: people were trying to kill him, but he had miraculously escaped. \u201cThis is a message from God that he will save you,\u201d she told him.\n\nBut after his appeal failed, Shazly told his mother not to hire a new lawyer. \u201cKeep this money for my sisters. If I am destined to die, I will die,\u201d he told her.\n\nOn 16 December, she had been waiting for his daily call, but when her phone rang, it was not Shazly. It was his cellmate.\n\n\u201cHe \\[his cellmate\\] told me that the guards had come and taken Essam at eight o\u2019clock in the morning and that his last words had been a request for forgiveness from his family; me, his father and his two sisters. He told me to pray for him.\u201d\n\nShazly spent his final days in one of the country\u2019s [most notorious prison ]( in the northern Saudi city of Tabuk. So many people transferred there were executed last year that inmates nicknamed it the \u201cdeath wing\u201d. Shazly told his mother they went for days without seeing daylight. \u201cMom, we don\u2019t see the sun,\u201d he told her.\n\n  \nIn December 2024, there were 33 Egyptians on the wing, including Shazly, all facing execution for non-violent drug offences. Just over a year on, just six are alive.\n\nUp until the end, his mother says she held out hope that her son would have his sentence commuted to a prison term. \u201cI was counting the days, thinking that if he is not executed this year, then maybe there is hope.\u201d\n\nA plea for clemency, filed as late as last November, highlighted serious inconsistencies in his confession. In one statement, Shazly said he was unaware of what was in the baggage found next to him in the sea; yet in another, he appeared to describe the quantities and contents of the drugs.\n\nHis clemency petition also noted that Shazly had suffered from severe depression and had been admitted to a mental health facility in Egypt before being arrested by Saudi officials. His mother says he had temporarily been admitted to hospital while in Tabuk after refusing to eat the meals provided at the prison.\n\n\u201cI think, for a while, he wasn\u2019t eating at all. He told me afterwards, when he had got out of hospital and recovered a little, that he wanted to die.\u201d\n\nAs she mourns her son\u2019s death, there will be no final chance for his mother to say goodbye at his funeral. The legal action charity Reprieve says Saudi Arabia does not return the bodies of those executed or inform families of their burial place.\n\n[Saudi officials said]( last month that they would continue to impose the \u201cseverest penalties prescribed by law against drug smugglers and traffickers, given the loss of innocent lives, the grave corruption it inflicts on youth, individuals and society, and the violation of their rights\u201d.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/26/death-penalty-saudi-arabia-executions-essam-shazly-human-rights", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for a free Windows tool dictation + AI responding to screen content", "summary": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m trying to find a free solution on Windows 11 that works similarly to Spokenly on Mac.

The trio also held talks focused on security, and in particular Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOne reflection that dominated today is that it\u2019s been 163 years since the January Uprising and one thing remains unchanged: Russia is still a threat to the region,\u201d said Poland\u2019s Karol Nawrocki. \u201cRegardless of whether it is Tsarist Russia, Bolshevik Russia or Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\u201d\n\nSpeaking alongside him, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky emphasised that the event was a reminder that \u201call of us in our part of Europe must fight and struggle to protect our sovereignty, our freedom and our independence\u201d.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da, who hosted the summit,\u00a0likewise declared that the \u201ccourage, faith and sacrifice \\[of the January insurgents\\] are an example to us all\u201d, showing that \u201ccommitment to freedom and refusal to submit to tyranny are a shared historical legacy\u201d.\u00a0\n\nThe January Uprising began on 22 January 1863 in so-called Congress Poland, which was a puppet state of Russia. Its area covered much of modern-day central and eastern Poland, as well as parts of Lithuania.\n\nThe insurrection initially broke out among Poles conscripted into the Russian army, and was joined by tens of thousands more, including Lithuanians and Belarusians. (Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya also joined today\u2019s ceremonies.)\n\nThe uprising was brutally suppressed by Russia \u2013 with thousands of Poles killed and many more deported to Siberia \u2013 and was eventually brought to an end in 1864, though Russian reprisals against the local population continued long after.\u00a0\n\nToday\u2019s meeting took place under the auspices of the\u00a0[Lublin Triangle]( a regional alliance established in 2020 between Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine. It is named after the 1569 Treaty of Lublin, which created the\u00a0[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]( a state that also contained much of modern-day Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Nawrocki recalled that the countries of their region had been proven right in their longstanding warnings about Russia. That emphasises why \u201cit is important for the voice of central and eastern Europe, and forums like this one, to be heard worldwide\u201d.\n\nHe and Naus\u0117da noted that Zelensky had updated them on the progress of peace negotiations, with Naus\u0117da commenting that, \u201cnot for the first time, we see Russia not wanting to commit to peace\u201d.\n\nZelensky, meanwhile, thanked Poland and Lithuania for their strong support since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. In particular, he expressed gratitude for recent\u00a0[efforts to help Ukraine deal with Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure](\n\nZelensky also said that he was \u201chappy that our partners in Lithuania and Poland support the idea of \\[Ukraine\\] joining the European Union\u201d, which is a \u201cpriority\u201d for Kyiv.\n\nHowever, although Poland\u2019s government\u00a0[supports Ukrainian membership]( Nawrocki \u2013 who is aligned with the right-wing opposition and regularly clashes with the government \u2013\u00a0[said last year](\u00a0that he is \u201cagainst Ukraine\u2019s entry at the moment\u201d.\n\nAfter today\u2019s summit, Naus\u0117da made clear that\u00a0\u201cLithuania is seeking to integrate Ukraine into the European structures\u201d, which he said would help \u201cprevent renewed Russian aggression\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/25/presidents-of-poland-ukraine-and-lithuania-mark-anniversary-of-19th-century-anti-russian-uprising/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Haiti's transitional council deepens political chaos by voting to oust the prime minister", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/haiti-transitional-council-ousts-prime-minister-filsaime-5ed3d85bdf798b13171ce894ebeca66a", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Congo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria] Daily Watch \u2013 Congo submits mining assets shortlist to Foreign investors, Seplat gas plant begins supplying gas to Indorama", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2026/01/daily-watch-congo-submits-mining-assets-shortlist-to-us-investors-seplat-gas-plant-begins-supplying-gas-to-indorama/#gsc.tab=0", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana] Daily Watch \u2013 Kenya secures duty-free access for exports, Ghana to scrap mining agreements and raise royalties", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2026/01/daily-watch-kenya-secures-duty-free-access-to-china-for-exports-ghana-to-scrap-mining-agreements-and-raise-royalties/#gsc.tab=0", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'It\u2019s okay to be antisemitic': Holocaust survivor says antisemitism would push her out of UK", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-884531", "author": "None"}, {"title": "As Generals Fall, Xi Jinping\u2019s Anti-Corruption Campaign Is Eating Itself", "summary": "", "link": "https://foreignpolicy.com/2026/01/26/xi-generals-zhang-youxia-anti-corruption-china/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
