While I understand these models typically require around 19GB VRAM, I'm wondering if it's possible to split the model layers between VRAM and CPU/RAM, even if it means significantly slower performance.\n\nMy current setup handles 14GB GGUF models smoothly, and I have 64GB DDR5 RAM available. I'm willing to sacrifice speed to run these larger models - has anyone successfully implemented this kind of VRAM/CPU memory split for inference?
