If you have a recent Apple Silicon Mac with at least 16GB of RAM (the more the better), it's possible to set up a local instance of Ollama / OpenWebUI without the overhead, [performance loss]( and potential complexity of Docker.  \n\nYes, you might prefer [Msty]( or [LM Studio]( if you really want a simple, self-contained way to chat with AI models.  But what if you want to learn OpenWebUI, how it works, maybe delve into MCP servers, or tools or filters.  Or maybe you want to set up a server for more than one computer on your network to access?  Or you want [maximum performance](  Then hopefully this will help.\n\nI've distilled info from [here]( to give you a quick set of commands to get things rolling.  My method is 1) install Brew, 2) use brew to install ollama &amp; pipx, and 3) use pipx to install OpenWebUI.\n\nOpen up a Terminal window, and paste in the following commands, one at a time, and wait for each step to finish:\n\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL \n\n    brew install ollama pipx\n\n    pipx install open-webui --python 3.12\n\nThen, start ollama in that window by typing\n\n     ollama serve \n\nthen open another terminal window and type\n\n     open-webui serve\n\nThen open a web browser and go to  and create your first account, the admin account.  \n\nThen you can, within OWUI, go to Admin Settings, Settings, Models, and click the \"download\" icon in the upper right that says \"Manage Models\" when you hover over it.  Go to the [Ollama Models]( page in a separate tab, and copy links to whatever model you want to download, and you can paste it in the dialog box, click download on the right, and wait for it to finish.  Refresh your main page when all done, and it'll show up in the upper left.\n\nIn my experience, both windows have to be open separately for both to run, but start ollama first.  Sure, this could all be handled with one script or in one window, I'm sure, but I'm no pro.\n\nYour GPU VRAM maximum allocation is usually 75% of total RAM, but [this can be tweaked](  Leave enough RAM (6GB or so) for your OS.  Be careful to not try to run any model that comes even close to your VRAM limit, or things will slow down - a lot.  Larger context windows use more RAM.\n\nTo terminate all running processes, just quit Terminal.  To upgrade to new versions of each, use \n\n    brew upgrade ollama\n\nif there's a new Ollama version, or\n\n    pipx upgrade-all\n\nif there's updates to OpenWebUI.\n\nI'll update this post if there are any mistakes.
