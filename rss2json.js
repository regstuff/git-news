India comes 3rd at 5%.\n\nIn my [previous post]( I discussed how India ranks 3rd globally in both quantity and quality in recent years, 4th in \u201cconsistency\u201d, and 5th historically (21 years) in quality research. Apart from a need to improve the quality to quantity ratio, these results reveal India\u2019s sudden emergence in the global science and technology stage. In this post I try to understand India\u2019s growth spurt, discussing only the contributions in \u201cquality\u201d research, i.e., top-10% research by citation count. We are not looking at \u201cconsistency\u201d i.e. h-index (tough to track over years) or raw quantity.\n\n[Post 00: About the Series](\n\n[Post 01: India\u2019s Standing](\n\n[ASPI\u2019s Interactive Tech-Tracker Website](\n\n**Data:** This post is based on data from Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), who have since 2023 maintained a database about scientific research in certain critical strategic technologies. They measure which country contributed how much to the top research in each technology \\[1,2\\]. Their work is free to view at the [website]( \\[3\\]. A large portion of this post also uses data from the report [R&amp;D Statistics at a Glance, 2022-23]( by the NSTMIS, which is a Government of India Department of Science &amp; Technology arm that tracks R&amp;D related statistics in India \\[14\\]. The India data is compared to data from several G20 countries, obtained from the OECD \\[43\\] and the United Nations \\[47, 48\\].\n\n**Disclaimer:** ASPI and NSTMIS are not responsible for this post or any analysis or opinions contained in it.\n\n**Details:** For references, methodology, list of all technologies, other posts in this series, and other meta discussion like volunteering, please refer to my [Post 00]( Remember to read ASPI\u2019s original reports at [1]( and [2]( , and visit their [website]( \\[3\\].\n\n# Historical Contributions by Region, 2003 - 2023\n\n[Figure 2A: Historical contributions to top-10&amp;#37; highly cited research in 64 critical technologies, by region. Percentage contribution to each technology first calculated, and then averaged. Data from https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/. For more on methodology, read the ASPI reports linked in my Post 00\u00a0 \\(i\\) Top: Yearly shares by region. \\(ii\\) Bottom: Cumulative shares by region, starting from 2003. Regions \\(top to bottom\\): Sub-Saharan Africa \\(thin green\\), West Asia, North Africa \\(red\\), South America \\(yellow\\), Oceania \\(thin cyan\\), Eurosphere, Eurasia \\(lighter blue\\), South Asia \\(dark gold\\), India, South East Asia \\(yellow\\), East Asia, China, Anglosphere.\u00a0](\n\nChina\u2019s dominance today is a story of 20 years of consistent linear growth at the expense of a similar linear decline in the Anglosphere\u2019s contribution (led by the US) since about 2004. The Eurosphere &amp; East Asia have similarly lost ground since 2009-10, and West Asia &amp; South East Asia have picked up some of this slack around the same time. But, unmistakably, China has been the biggest winner. Again unmistakably, the second biggest winner has been India starting much later, around 2016.\n\nDespite the global North\u2019s recent backsliding in its share of global research, their historical contribution can still have long-lasting effects. Patents take 20 years to expire, for instance. Going from lab to industry is a long process in most technologies, and their effects are plain to see in the continued industrial dominance of Western companies in several strategic sectors. China, having now secured a competitive spot even in terms of cumulative historical research contribution, can be expected to have achieved similar competitiveness in many strategic industries. As many strategic analysts point out, it does.\n\nThe global North has dropped the ball on research. The Anglosphere &amp; East Asia have surrendered a third of their research potential to effectively facilitate China\u2019s rise. The Eurosphere also let go of a fifth of its cumulative research power, so to speak. India, West Asia, &amp; South East Asia took on some of the responsibility since 2010.\n\nIndia\u2019s share was a quarter of China\u2019s even in 2003. But, while China rose consistently for a whole 20 years, India only picked up its pace in the recent past. The next figure makes this more clear. One last note. West Asia started off better than India, but hasn\u2019t caught up to India\u2019s recent rapid rise. Neither has South East Asia, largely led by Singapore, been able to expand on its gains to be competitive with India. India\u2019s rise, if consistent, could mimic China\u2019s in its rapidity, and potentially capture a large chunk of global share in research.\n\n# Yearly Contributions by Country, 2003 - 2023\n\n[Figure 2B: Yearly contributions to top-10&amp;#37; highly cited research in 64 critical technologies, by country, during the 2003 - 2023 period. These 9 countries are the only ones who have been in the top 5 during this period. Percentage contribution per technology is calculated, then averaged across technologies. Data from https:\\/\\/techtracker.aspi.org.au\\/. \\(i\\) Top: As described. \\(ii\\) Bottom: Same, but in log scale.](\n\nThe two graphs above show the same data. In the first figure, the US &amp; China dominate, and all other countries\u2019 contributions are barely noticeable. The second figure is in logarithmic scale so we can visualise the other countries\u2019 progress.\n\nChina &amp; the US have an absolute command over global science. As the US continues to cede space to China, research from Japan &amp; France continue to decline rapidly. The UK resisted the decline till around Brexit in 2020. The German growth story reversed in 2010, and Italy\u2019s around 2014, but Italy maintained far more ground than other declining countries in this list. South Korea is the only developed country here to maintain positive growth.\n\nIndia\u2019s story is the most different from the bunch. India has always made a somewhat bumpy upward progress in its share of global research. Since 2019, the progress has been in a consistent upward trajectory. Depending upon how you choose to smooth out the rough bumps, you might even notice the trajectory beginning a few years earlier, around 2010.\n\n# Yearly Gross Domestic Product, 2003 - 2023\n\n[Figure 2C: Yearly share in global gross domestic product \\(GDP, current prices\\) by country, during the 2003 - 2023 period \\(in log scale\\) for the countries in Figure 2B. Data from the UN Statistics Division.](\n\nOne might think that a country\u2019s research output is proportional to its share of global GDP. The figure above gives the global share of GDP by country for the top 9 countries in highly cited research in the 64 critical technologies.\u00a0\n\nThe relationship between GDP and a country\u2019s critical technologies research output is rather unclear, and varies with the country. For some, there is some correlation, even if not strong. An increase in China\u2019s share of global GDP coincides with an increased share of highly cited research; a reduced share in GDP for Japan\u2019s &amp; France\u2019s coincides with reduced research output. For Germany, Italy &amp; the UK, the decline in research starts about 10 years after their GDP share starts to decline.\n\nThe US, South Korea, &amp; India are unusual cases. USA\u2019s share in global GDP stays static even as its critical technologies research output reduces. South Korea\u2019s share of global GDP in 2023 is roughly the same as 2003, but it has made gains in research (not as dramatic as China or India). India\u2019s rise in share of critical technology research, oddly, happens more consistently around the time when its growth in share of global GDP plateaus.\n\nSo. GDP, alone, does not explain research output. Particularly, India\u2019s.\n\n# Yearly R&amp;D Investment by Country, 2003 - 2023\n\n[Figure 2D: Yearly gross expenditure in research and development \\(GERD\\) by country, during 2003 - 2023, as a percentage share of \\(i\\) Global GDP that year \\(log scale\\) \\(ii\\) National GDP that year, for the countries in Figure 2B. Data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and UN Statistics Division.](\n\nDifferent countries could be spending different amounts on research, i.e. they have different \u201cGross Expenditure in Research and Development\u201d or GERD. This is tracked by countries as part of the sustainable development goals set by the UN (SDG 9.5). In the figures above, GERD is represented as a percentage of either the global GDP or national GDP for a given year. I will be using the abbreviation GERD%N as a shorthand for GERD as a percentage of national GDP. GERD%N is a decent indicator of how much an individual country prioritises research over other expenses. Data is from United Nations agencies \\[47, 48\\].\n\nThese graphs, with Figure 2B and 2C, describe a complicated story, and I will take you through it bit by bit, starting with the declining powers.\n\nThe United States has plateaued in its share of global GDP. This coincides with a dramatic loss in its share of global highly cited research each year, ceding space to China. A recent increase in R&amp;D funding has halted the rapid decline. But, it remains a mystery how despite having near-constant GERD%N from 2003 to 2020, the USA steadily lost ground to China.\n\nThis is similar to Germany\u2019s mysterious decline in share of critical technology research, despite using steadily increased GERD%N to make up for its steadily declining global GDP share. France is equally odd. Unlike Germany, France\u2019s increase in GERD%N has not kept up with the decline in global GDP share. Even so, the absolute descent in its share of global research is far too dramatic to be explained simply by a reduced share in global GERD.\u00a0\n\nIn these 3 cases (the US,Germany, &amp; France), additional government or industry policies must have led to their diminished share of research. Their research decline looks worse than their funding would suggest. I won\u2019t try to figure out why that is the case, because citizens of these countries are better equipped to do that. My gut says that this has something to do with outsourcing research to China, but I have no solid citations on the matter.\n\nThe UK, similar to the US, halted its decline in research outcomes with major increases in R&amp;D funding despite a downward tumbling GDP share that would have otherwise dragged down its share in global research even further. The recent rapid drop coincided with Brexit, but I will leave British scholars to figure out the link.\n\nJapan has had the most precipitous decline in global GDP share. Despite irregular increases in its GERD%N, the decline in GDP has dragged down its share in research. Italy is similar - their steadily increasing GERD%N could not make up for the far more rapid decline in GDP.\u00a0\n\nChina more than doubled its GERD%N over 21 years, and along with a dramatic increase in GDP, it makes sense how it has come to dominate global research. South Korea also doubled their GERD%N, but with stagnant GDP share, their share in global research has only seen moderate (but steady) progress.\n\nIn all four cases (Japan, Italy, China &amp; South Korea), research funding alone can quite easily explain the observed research outcomes. No mystery here.\n\nIndia\u2019s growth spurt is exceptional. With relatively poor GERD%N and twice-plateaued GDP, how India managed to accelerate its research progress is unclear. As with the US, Germany &amp; France, if funding can\u2019t explain the oddity, it must be some government / industry policies.\n\n# Government of India: Programs and Policies\n\nVery few policies or initiatives in GoI\u2019s Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) website seem to begin around when India\u2019s scientific output accelerated, i.e. first in 2010 and then 2019. A list of all programs is in [Post 00]( There are two I would like to highlight in particular, because they coincide with India\u2019s accelerated rise.\n\n**The PURSE Program**\n\nThe PURSE (Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence) program started in 2009 \\[33\\], with the objective of promoting top-tier research in universities. But why was this program even needed? Isn\u2019t that the whole point of GoI\u2019s R&amp;D budget? Well, no.\n\nTypically scientific research at universities is funded through government grants (private or industry grants aren\u2019t as common, no citations). These government grants are funnelled through certain scientific agencies under the government. These scientific agencies make up less than 40% of the government\u2019s GERD, and not all of it goes out as grants. So, how much funding do universities actually get? It is difficult to tell. A rough estimate, adding up the R&amp;D funding going to ICAR, DST, CSIR and DBT, stands at about 13% of India\u2019s total GERD. Where does the rest of the money go? You will have to wait for the next post for that.\n\nHaving more avenues for funding research makes sense in this context, and PURSE was designed specifically to promote high quality research in domains of national priority. PURSE explicitly excludes academic institutes such as IISc, IITs, IISERs, NITs, etc., since they already had an active research culture and so had easier access to funds from the scientific agencies like DST, DBT, etc. As a rule of thumb, universities with a \u201cUniversity\u201d in their name were eligible for PURSE funding. PURSE helped many universities improve their research outcomes &amp; quality publications during and even after their PURSE funding concluded \\[33\\].\n\nBut PURSE is a small initiative. If my math is right, the total per-year expenditure in PURSE Phase IA &amp; IB was 0.3% of India\u2019s 2010-11 GERD. Its impact is difficult to judge, since the ASPI data does not have enough details on the historical research trajectory of all individual Indian institutes in their data. However, one thing could be noted since 2010 - India\u2019s research trajectory began to steadily take on exponential growth (Figure 2B). Whether it was PURSE or some general trend of prioritising research, there was some visible impact.\n\nOn a separate note, this may be partly why the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) was announced with the National Education Policy (NEP) in 2020 \\[40\\] - to give more avenues for grants. NRF was constituted only in February 2024, with a first year budget of \u20b92000 crores. For context, India\u2019s total GERD in 2020-21 was about \u20b9127,000 crores, which means that NRF got at most 1.6% of India\u2019s GERD. If I am not wrong, the 2025-26 budget documents reveal that only \u20b9200 crores out of the budgeted \u20b92000 crores were spent \\[39\\]. You can put that down under teething troubles, but this is not an auspicious start. A budget of \u20b91950 crores has been allocated for 2025-26. Hope we spend it this time.\n\n**NIRF: When short on carrots\u2026**\n\nThe biggest growth spurt in India\u2019s research started in 2019. And the hero here, or the culprit, is the National Institutional Ranking Framework (or NIRF). NIRF was announced in 2015, with the purpose of ranking universities, institutes, and colleges all over India \\[36\\]. As a ranking provided by the government, this has an enormous impact on which colleges are considered the best for prospective students in India\u2019s higher education system.\n\nWhy does NIRF matter? Because for the first time ever, universities &amp; colleges in India were going to be scored on their research outcomes \\[36\\], as part of a government ranking for institutes. NIRF had announced that for the \u201cOverall\u201d rankings, it would give 40% weightage to research outcomes. Out of the 40%, 4% was reserved for patents. The remaining 36% was split evenly between (i) a percentile score for number of publications per faculty, and (ii) the total number of citations per publication (which for some reason was again multiplied with percentile in sub-score (i)). So now 36% of what determines your college\u2019s ranking, reputation, enrollment, and probably most importantly, tuition fees you can claim from the richer but less meritorious applicants, is now governed by research outcomes. Yuck.\n\nBelieve it or not, the weightage for research is no longer 40% now. It was set to 30% in 2019 \\[37\\]. Which, honestly, I am surprised hasn\u2019t been dragged lower by incessant lobbying. Honestly, considering the backlash NIRF gets, I applaud GoI for standing its ground at 30%.\n\nVery few institutes\u2019 research trajectories have been presented in the ASPI data \\[3\\]. Among the 21 trajectories that were not an IIT, IISc, NIT or a GoI scientific institute, 19 showed a noticeable increase in research output after 2016. The only exception was Anna University, which for some unknown reason actually cared for research before NIRF. Details in [Post 00](\n\nSo I can confidently say that most institutes in India, especially private institutions of higher education, only took interest in research after NIRF rankings started to affect their reputation (and thus, bottomlines). I am not the first to notice the huge impact that NIRF has had on India\u2019s publication and citation numbers. A careful analysis by some scholars shows how state universities have been slipping, while NITs &amp; \u201cdeemed universities\u201d have risen in their research outcomes \\[38\\]. The good news here is that neither have shaken the IITs from their top position despite the competition having considerably heated up in recent years.\n\n**Taking Goodhart to heart**\n\nIn my [previous post (Post 01)]( I had figures showing how India has ranked highly in ASPI\u2019s rankings for publications in terms of raw numbers and citation counts. Note that these are the metrics NIRF is also measuring. The main difference being that ASPI measures for each technology separately, which makes more sense since some domains naturally have high publication rates and others have low. But India lagged behind on h-index according to ASPI, a metric that NIRF is not measuring. Naturally, there have been calls for adding an h-index metric to the NIRF rankings, under the belief that what is measured will be improved. But will it help?\u00a0\n\nThere is also the problem that the NIRF ranking equates one citation on a food habits survey paper with one citation in a thorium salt reactor design improvements. Expertise in niche technological domains is not rewarded by NIRF. Research domains where it is \u201ceasier\u201d to publish (eg: if they do not require high capital expenditure on scientific instruments) will be unduly rewarded while harder, slower research is ignored because of \u201clow citation count\u201d. Better qualified scientists have suggested more improvements to NIRF, but will it help?\n\nAs there has been a surge of publications in recent years, and a soaring citation count, there have been widespread reports on scientific malpractice in India. Proliferation of \u201ccasual\u201d papers with no serious science to increase publication numbers, and colleges forcing their faculty to cite each others\u2019 papers to increase citation counts. \u201cA paper on fruit and vegetable consumption published by students and faculty from one university, for instance, had cited a study on diesel engines by others in the same university.\u201d Paper mills and unethical low quality pay-and-publish journals abound. \\[41\\]\u00a0\n\nThese complaints don\u2019t even touch the social problems created by gamifying research, like the exploitation of students, a nationwide loss of integrity, and the consequent issues this may cause for the reputation of meritorious researchers from our country.\n\nThe government noticed how widespread the problem is, and decided to modify NIRF to now give negative marks for universities with paper retractions and other research malpractice. \u201cOver the past two to three years, many institutes have seen a significant number of research papers retracted, raising concerns about their credibility. Experts say that unless negative marks are introduced, institutes are unlikely to take corrective action.\u201d \\[42\\] Whether this will improve academic integrity or instate a \u201cnot on paper\u201d corruption, it is hard to say.\n\nThis chain of events is something you might expect when the gamification of quantitative metrics requires colleges to produce more research output without a concomitant increase in GERD%N. As good old Goodheart once said, \"whenever a government seeks to rely on a previously observed statistical regularity for control purposes, that regularity will collapse\u201d. What you measure, you corrupt.\n\nOn the positive side, even if the metrics have been gamified and perverted, this has created a culture of research in India that did not previously exist at this scale. You can see how the IITs have pushed themselves harder because of this competition \\[38\\], although it may also be that they have joined in on the corruption. While it is hard to envisage a metric that cannot be corrupted by Goodheart\u2019s law, truly valuable research can change the landscape of India\u2019s public and private sector industry.\u00a0\n\n# Opinion\n\nA general malaise has taken over India\u2019s university system, with little investment to upgrade even the normal civic infrastructure, let alone the unimaginable capital expenses you need to purchase state of the art scientific equipment. An academician faces a whole lot of byzantine bureaucracy even when funding is secure. This environment creates sequestered scientists whose work becomes more removed from industrial applications. These are some of the issues JNU Professor Binay Panda mentions in [his critique of the ANRF]( \\[49\\]. Please give it a read. Some of his other points probably no longer apply after the recent RDI scheme announcement, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe atrophied research skills in Indian institutions is now being highlighted by the post-NIRF scandals of academic malpractice \\[41, 42\\]. The fact that universities in themselves should be a place to conduct research, not just get degrees, has disappeared from our consciousness. The longer this marital separation of higher education from research prolongs, the more perilous our path to progress.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFor countries like China, Japan, South Korea and Italy, R&amp;D expenditure trends track with the country\u2019s research output in critical technologies. For some, like the US, UK, France and Germany, their share of global critical technology research actually is less than what their funding should suggest. And for India, the biggest oddball of the bunch, we see a growth spurt despite a practically stagnant share in global R&amp;D expenditure. All thanks to NIRF.\n\nWhile NIRF has definitely shaken up India\u2019s higher education sector, forcing it to relearn the lost art of research, it is not clear if there is any more juice you can squeeze out of this lemon before things get too bitter. There is only so far you can push scientists to publish papers without any uptick in the shameful 0.65% of our GDP that we spend on GERD. Academic malpractice has already become far too common.\n\nNonetheless, even though it is not sustainable in the long run, this approach of naming and shaming universities for their research performance has allowed India to consistently up its game both in the raw number of papers as well as the quality of these papers. Now that the higher education sector has been spurred into action, it is time for there to be an enormous increase in the R&amp;D expenditure. 1% of GDP is a bare minimum.\u00a0\n\nAnd if we don\u2019t, it's brain drain or brain rot, or both.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1of3kus/crittech_02_indias_growth_spurt_tldr_nirfed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Custom outlook .msg extraction", "summary": "I'm currently trying out extracting individual .msg messages vs via the m365 cli tool, but what bothers me is that the current extraction of .msg is via extract-msg, which by default when used by Open WebUI it only extracts in text format.\n\nWould it be possible to set flags for extract-msg so that it could output in JSON / HTML?
