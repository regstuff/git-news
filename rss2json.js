Indonesia, with its draconian death penalty for drug offences, isn't enforcing justice - it's performing a ritual. There is no logic here, no reason, only a grim spectacle of power. [Foreign nationals]( including Indians, are paraded as sacrificial lambs, their lives offered up in tribute to a nation haunted by the ghost of the Opium Wars and ruled by lingering insecurities.\n\nConsider the facts. Indonesia's drug enforcement laws are among the strictest globally, with the death penalty reserved not for violent crimes but for drug offences, even in cases without direct violence/deaths. Western nations, and even India, have long recognised the ethical absurdity of executing individuals for drug-related crimes. No democratic society considers death a proportionate response to drug trafficking, yet Indonesia does. Why? Look closer, and a disturbing pattern emerges: an almost [theatrical punishment system]( rooted less in justice and more in appeasement.\n\nWhile civilised nations have moved away from capital punishment for drug offences, Indonesia clings to a brutal legacy that feels more like medieval obedience than law. But who benefits here? Certainly not the people, not the families, and certainly not justice. This \u201cblood tribute\u201d serves only one purpose: appeasement. It's a gesture to their Chinese overlords, a way of saying: \"Look, we are loyal, we will spill blood if you command it.\" In the end, it's not about crime and punishment, it's about power and submission.\n\nTo understand the spectacle here, rewind to China\u2019s obsession with drug laws. Scarred by the [Opium Wars]( China imposed draconian anti-drug policies, and its influence lingers heavily over Southeast Asia. The region\u2019s harsh drug laws are a legacy of this historical wound - an overcompensation, a response to fears China passed down like a curse. Today, it seems Indonesia is willing to wield this \u201cblack magic\u201d to prove its loyalty.\n\nNow add Indian nationals to the picture. Recently, Indonesian prosecutors have announced that they will be pursuing the death penalty in case of three Indian nationals on drug charges. I am not here to argue mitigating factors regarding the gravity of the alleged crimes they have committed; however, the death penalty is wholly disproportionate, especially in the absence of direct causation involving anyone\u2019s death. Meanwhile, we see Indonesian prosecutors selectively exercising \u201cdiscretion.\u201d In a high-profile case involving Australian citizen [Gregor Haas,]( the prosecutors quietly dropped the death penalty, to facilitate his extradition. Conveniently, the act aligns with a key diplomatic interest. So, discretion clearly exists, just not for Indian nationals.\n\nWith 3.4 million regular drug users and a $4.3 billion underground drug economy, Indonesia\u2019s death penalty has proven toothless in curbing its drug issues. Another crucial point is that focusing punishment on mules and low-level traffickers, while leaving the real architects of these operations untouched, is a fundamental failure of justice. It\u2019s a travesty to see the lowest-level operatives bearing the brunt of punishment while the kingpins - both within Indonesia and abroad - remain unchallenged. A fair judicial system must target the criminal networks that use low level traffickers, not just those who carry out their orders.\n\nThe geopolitical imperative here for India is to prevent its citizens from facing the death penalty for a crime that, while serious, does not warrant such punishment either under Indian law, or by the standards of the broader civilised world. If these individuals have indeed committed a crime under Indonesian law, they must be sentenced appropriately, though this should not extend to the death penalty. Should Indonesia disregard this and proceed with pursuing the death penalty for the traffickers, India must ensure that it imposes diplomatic costs for Indonesia's actions.\n\nThe Diplomat:\u00a0[Indonesia on the Cusp of BrahMos Missile Purchase: Report](\u00a0(July 2022)\n\n\"For Indonesia, the benefits of acquiring this powerful new weapons system are not hard to discern. While the country\u2019s navy has operated the ship-based Russian-origin Yakhont supersonic anti-ship cruise missile since 2011, the purchase of the more advanced BrahMos system would represent a significant upgrade to its maritime deterrent capability in the waters around the Natuna islands, which overlap with China\u2019s expansive \u201cnine-dash line\u201d claim, and which over the past decade have seen repeated incursions by Chinese fishing boats and maritime militia vessels.\"\n\nIndia has several levers of geopolitical influence in this case that it can use to persuade Indonesia's new leadership to consider India's interests more carefully. As the Diplomat notes, Indonesia's defence strategy could see a significant boost with the acquisition of the BrahMos missile system, especially in light of evidence of [recent Chinese aggression]( near the Natuna islands. Indonesia has shown long-standing interest in acquiring this system, with talks ongoing for some time. If India moves forward with this sale, it will likely extend a line of credit to help facilitate the purchase - a critical offer, as Indonesia\u2019s [current economic situation]( might otherwise limit its ability to afford these systems.\n\nOur policy-makers and decision-makers must see this for what it is: It is not law enforcement, it is political theatre, plain and simple. With these executions, Indonesia signals fealty as a vassal, playing up its tough-on-crime image for the benefit of a powerful neighbour. Make no mistake: this is not justice but an orchestrated blood ritual, where foreign nationals serve as offerings to placate a legacy that belongs less to Indonesia than to Chinese influence in the region.\n\nFor India, this case goes beyond diplomatic concerns, it is a question of dharma and artha. True justice, or dharma, is only served when punishment fits the crime, and when humanity is preserved, even for those who may seem undeserving. Artha must be wielded to protect Indian citizens from a sentence that neither Indian law nor the broader civilised world would consider just. India has the leverage to prevent this travesty, and it must use it.\n\nLet us not forget the case of [Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey]( who was shot dead by a police firing squad in Indonesia in 2004, nine years after being sentenced to death for drug smuggling. Back then, India passively accepted his fate, allowing his life to become a quiet offering on foreign soil.\n\nIn the end, these Indian nationals are once again pawns, marked for death in a spectacle of allegiance. This is modern blood sacrifice, wrapped in the language of deterrence but practiced in the spirit of submission. India must act now, or the grim precedent will endure, transforming justice into a tool of obeisance in the region.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1gopzn1/death_penalty_as_ritual_murder_indonesias_human/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Good News, the Ozone Layer Hole is Continuing to Shrink: The area of depleted ozone over the Antarctic ranked the seventh smallest since recovery began in 1992\n", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.universetoday.com/169251/good-news-the-ozone-layer-hole-is-continuing-to-shrink/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "6.8 magnitude earthquake shakes Cuba after hurricanes and blackouts", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/cuba-earthquake-hurricanes-natural-disaster-c28bbf4496a1bbe27a39f80728d63b2d", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I don\u2019t know what to do and my university is waiting for an answer ", "summary": "I\u2019ve seen that many people have had similar doubts and problems, so I thought I\u2019d ask in this community.\n\nBy today, I need to decide on my study plan and potential specializations, and the professor is waiting for an answer, but I really don\u2019t know what to do. Of course, I want to organize my study plan in a way that leads to specific areas of specialization, and I don\u2019t want to randomly select courses.\n\nFor now, I\u2019ve organized my path to be fairly technical, focusing on the technical side of NLP because, if I don\u2019t want to continue in research, I would like a study plan that allows me to work in the industry. So I chose additional courses in ML, LLM, Grounded Language Processing, etc.\n\nMy main idea would be to specialize in Grounded Language Processing, meaning the integration of language and vision in AI systems, a typical research area at my university. However, the problem is that, being new to everything, I\u2019m not sure if the more technical - ML side of NLP is something I enjoy or if it\u2019s right for me.\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019m already having trouble with the programming and math courses. For this reason, I wanted to choose some more linguistic or generally less technical courses as a \u201cPlan B\u201d in case I realize the technical part is not really for me.\n\nI was considering several options, such as:\n\t\u2022\tUsing NLP techniques to analyze linguistic documents and language evolution, for example, in Germanic philology. But my university doesn\u2019t really conduct this type of research, so I\u2019m not sure how I could pursue it. I would definitely have to integrate it by choosing a Germanic studies course.\n\t\u2022\tNeurolinguistics: simply because it\u2019s always fascinated me, and maybe I could use NLP techniques to analyze language disorders, or vice versa, use neurolinguistics knowledge to improve and compare the performance of NLP systems.\n\t\u2022\tComputational linguistics: there\u2019s this course, the only one in my department, which focuses specifically on using computational methods to investigate languages and language, especially linguistic universals.\n\t\u2022\tLanguage and Cognition; my linguistics professor offers this course at his lab center where they study the role of language in various cognitive abilities, developing theoretical and computational models of human language, of how it\u2019s learned and represented in the brain, also using neural networks.\n\n\nThese are the main research areas I could specialize in during my Master\u2019s, and they are also the courses I need to choose from. I have to choose one, and I would love to take them all, but I don\u2019t have more time to decide, plus I\u2019ve already added one extra course, so I wouldn\u2019t want to add more.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1goup8w/i_dont_know_what_to_do_and_my_university_is/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\nWillow diplomacy: Australia triples military exchange with India", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.themandarin.com.au/280861-willow-diplomacy-australia-triples-military-exchange-with-india/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Economic Diplomacy Now A Major Focus In Indian Foreign Policy, Says EAM Jaishankar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.outlookindia.com/national/economic-diplomacy-now-a-major-focus-in-indian-foreign-policy-says-eam-jaishankar", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Saudi crown prince says Israel committing 'genocide' in Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8x5570514o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New release terminal pager ov v0.37.0.\nThe Align option has made psql and MySQL results more convenient.\nCSVs can also be displayed by arranging columns.\nThe fastest CSV viewer for large CSV files.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/noborus/ov/releases/tag/v0.37.0", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
