Additionally, if I provide the fine tune model one of the duplicated prompts in my dataset, my hope is that it consolidates all the response and generates a cohesive monologue using all the different responses.\n\nI have rarely seen this problem with same prompts, different responses online, but from what I've read, a lot of people have recommended RAG or embeddings for similar problems. While that is a potential solution, RAG and embeddings runs into the token limit issue, so it won't be able to leverage all the different monologues for some duplicated prompts.   \n\n\nI understand this a bit of a complex issue and fine-tuning isn't generally designed for this type of use case, but if I were to start a fine tuning pipeline with the 8B instruct model, does anyone have any helpful tips on how I can approach this and how feasible it is?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1dd9xuq/fine_tuning_llama3_8b_instruct_model_on_dataset/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NC developers seek to build on land with up to 3,000-year-old Native American remains", "summary": "In case anyone else wanted to be sickened this morning.

People die in stampedes, desperate for free sacks of rice. Hospitals are overrun with women wracked by spasms from calcium deficiencies.\n\nThe crisis is largely believed to be rooted in two major changes implemented by a [president elected 15 months ago]( the [partial removal of fuel subsidies]( and the floating of the currency, which together have caused major price rises.\n\nA nation of entrepreneurs, Nigeria\u2019s more than 200 million citizens are skilled at managing in tough circumstances, without the services states usually provide. They [generate]( their own [electricity]( and source their own water. They take up arms and [defend]( their communities when the armed forces cannot. They negotiate with [kidnappers]( when family members are abducted.\n\nBut right now, their resourcefulness is being stretched to the limit.\n\n[Full copy of the article](", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/world/africa/nigeria-economy-strike.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Reform candidate says UK should have \u2018taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality\u2019 instead of fighting Nazis - He also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and described Winston Churchill as \u2018abysmal\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-reform-candidate-hitler-neutrality-nazi-b2559954.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Elephants call each other by name, study finds", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jun/10/elephant-names-study-ai", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "UConn men\u2019s basketball coach Dan Hurley turns down $70 million LA Lakers contract, ESPN says", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">UConn men\u2019s basketball coach Dan Hurley turns down $70 million LA Lakers contract, ESPN says</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDYvMTAvc3BvcnQvZGFuLWh1cmxleS11Y29ubi1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWNvYWNoL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUpodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA2LzEwL3Nwb3J0L2Rhbi1odXJsZXktdWNvbm4tYmFza2V0YmFsbC1jb2FjaA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-06-10", "author": "None"}]}}};
