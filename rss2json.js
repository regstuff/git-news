After the speech, many of them lit red flares.\n\nDuring his election campaign last year, Nawrocki, a former boxer and supporter of his hometown football club Lechia Gda\u0144sk, admitted that in his younger days he had taken part in brawls between football hooligans, calling them \u201cnoble fights\u201d.\n\nSaturday\u2019s pilgrimage, which sees fans of rival clubs put aside their differences in a display of religious unity, was taking place for the 18th time. Nawrocki has attended before, including as a presidential candidate last year.\n\nDuring his speech, he thanked football fans, who are often sympathetic towards the political right, for ensuring that \u201cstadiums were not touched by propaganda and passing ideological fads\u201d and for helping \u201cdefend this slogan that we invoke: God, honour, fatherland\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is why I became president,\u201d declared Nawrocki, who is aligned with Poland\u2019s right-wing opposition. \u201cWe managed to win this together \\[at the election\\] on 1 June \\[2025\\], thanks in part to your courage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want Poland to be normal, Poland to be strong, Poland to be safe, our borders to be secure, and Poland to be a prosperous country without illegal immigrants,\u201d he declared.\n\nHowever, Nawrocki also said that he and the fans had come together to demonstrate \u201cChristian values \u200b\u200bthat speak of love, mercy and openness to others\u201d, and to show that \u201cPoland has a place for everyone\n\nThe president noted that many politicians and journalists have been \u201cinsulting the fan community for years\u201d.\n\nBut he recalled the words of Jesus during the Sermon on the Mount, telling the gathered fans: \u201cLove those who hate you. Bless those who persecute you, but pray also for those who seek to destroy you and who harm you.\u201d\n\nThe pilgrimage, and football fan groups more broadly, have often been criticised by parts of the media and centrist and left-wing politicians for their associations with nationalism and violence.\n\nOn Sunday, Tomasz Trela, an MP from The Left (Lewica), which is part of Poland\u2019s ruling coalition, criticised Nawrocki for attending a pilgrimage of \u201cstadium thugs\u201d.\n\nWirtualna Polska, a leading news website, reports that, while at Jasna G\u00f3ra yesterday, Nawrocki was pictured embracing the leader of a hooligan gang who has convictions for serious violent crimes and whose home was found to contain photos of \u201cracist and Nazi behaviour\u201d when searched by police.\n\nAt previous pilgrimages, fans have\u00a0[sung chants](\u00a0about \u201changing communists from trees\u201d, which critics have argued is inappropriate at a Catholic shrine. Some participants have displayed white supremacist symbols, such as the Celtic cross.\n\nIn 2020, the religious authorities at Jasna G\u00f3ra monastery for the first time\u00a0[issued rules prohibiting political speeches]( as well as the promotion of racism, xenophobia and nationalism. However, right-wing political figures have continued to speak there during pilgrimages and other events.\n\nLast year, Nawrocki\u2019s main rival for the presidency, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, criticised his opponent for his appearance at the fans\u2019 pilgrimage, saying that it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that he was campaigning at a Catholic shrine.\n\nDuring his campaign, Nawrocki also\u00a0[faced media claims](\u00a0that he had in the past been associated with criminal elements linked to football fan groups, and even involved himself in procuring prostitutes.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk claimed that Nawrocki had \u201cconnections with gangsters\u201d and had been involved in \u201carranging girls\u201d for guests at a luxury hotel where he worked in security.\n\nHowever, Nawrocki denied the accusations and has never faced any charges for criminal activity.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/11/president-calls-for-poland-without-illegal-immigrants-at-football-fan-pilgrimage-to-catholic-shrine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I Was Kidnapped by Idiots", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/kidnapped-baghdad/685470/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish public administration excludes software from vendors other than Microsoft in public tenders", "summary": "", "link": "https://cyberdefence24.pl/polityka-i-prawo/polska-administracja-jest-uzalezniona-od-oprogramowania-microsoftu-publiczne-przetargi-pod-lupa", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Myanmar made Rohingya lives a nightmare, Gambia tells genocide case", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/landmark-myanmar-rohingya-genocide-case-open-uns-top-court-2026-01-12/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Moldova\u2019s Sandu says she would vote for reunification with Romania", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/maia-sandu-moldova-vote-reunification-romania/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Slovak journalist attacked, government ministers fault his public statements", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/slovak-journalist-attack-draws-crocodile-tears-government-ministers-peter-schutz/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU reaches South America trade deal after 25 years of talks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqzj49gny4o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Duhok Governor Reaffirms Shared Destiny as Foundation Stone Laid for Assyrian Genocide Memorial", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/885179/duhok-governor-reaffirms-shared-destiny-as-foundation-stone-laid-for-assyrian-genocide-memorial", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan\u2019s army renewing military effort to retake Kordofan, Darfur from RSF", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/12/the-sudanese-army-is-renewing-a-military-effort-to-retake-kordofan-darfur", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hungary grants asylum to Polish former justice minister Ziobro", "summary": "Hungary has granted asylum to former Polish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who is facing charges in Poland for\u00a026 alleged crimes committed while he served in the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government.\n\n\u201cI have decided to accept the asylum granted to me by the government of Hungary due to the political persecution in Poland,\u201d wrote Ziobro in a statement on social media. \u201cI extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to \\[Hungarian\\] Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\u201d\n\nZiobro claimed that Poland\u2019s current government, which replaced PiS in power in December 2023, is overseeing a \u201ccreeping dictatorship\u201d and that he had \u201cbecome the target of \\[Prime Minister\\] Donald Tusk\u2019s personal vendetta\u201d.\n\nHe also revealed that he had applied for asylum for his wife, saying that there is \u201can attempt to treat \\[her\\] as a hostage to force me to return to the country\u201d and \u201cI will not allow my wife, in my stead, to become the victim of Donald Tusk\u2019s psychopathic revenge\u201d.\n\nLast week, it emerged that Hungary had granted asylum to two unnamed Polish citizens on 23 December. That led to speculation that one of them was Ziobro, who left Poland for Hungary in October, shortly before Poland\u2019s justice minister\u00a0[asked parliament](\u00a0to lift his immunity from prosecution.\n\nZiobro\u2019s former deputy justice minister, Marcin Romanowski, was likewise\u00a0[granted asylum by Hungary in 2024](\u00a0after fleeing criminal charges in Poland.
