Joint ventures would continue to require a majority state-owned stake.\n\nThe law, if given final approval when lawmakers vote again next week, would maintain a baseline royalty rate of 30 per cent, though it would allow reductions to 20 per cent and 15 per cent in certain cases, \u201cin order to achieve the economic viability\u201d of projects. The proposal also eliminates the mandate that disputes are settled in local courts.\n\nA staff member of Orlando Camacho, a lawmaker from the pro-government bloc who presented the legislation during Thursday\u2019s session, said the bill had been drafted by Venezuela\u2019s executive branch.

In particular, the status of thousands of judges (often referred to as \u201cneo-judges\u201d) appointed after the KRS was reformed by PiS, and the rulings issued by them, has been called into question.\n\nThe current government, which replaced PiS in December 2023, has presented bills to\u00a0[restore the KRS\u2019s legitimacy](\u00a0and\u00a0[invalidate most judicial appointments](\u00a0made after the KRS was overhauled by PiS. However, it has so far failed to implement those plans.\n\nCommenting on the case in Gi\u017cycko, justice minister Waldemar \u017burek said that it underscored the need for urgent reform of the justice system, noting that parliament would this week begin work on the two bills.\n\n\u201cThe case in which a divorce judgment was deemed non-existent\u2026reveals something deeply disturbing,\u201d wrote \u017burek on social media. \u201cThe crisis surrounding neo-judges is now infiltrating the most sensitive areas of citizens\u2019 lives. Into family matters, property issues and the fundamental sense of legal security.\u201d\n\nThe situation has \u201cgenerated chaos in the courts, and led to situations where people do not know whether their judgments even exist\u201d, he added. \u201cThat is why this problem must be resolved\u201d.\n\nHowever, Zbigniew Ziobro, who served as justice minister under the former PiS government, blamed the current administration for the situation, saying that they had \u201cbrought about the real chaos and anarchy\u201d by questioning judicial appointments.\n\nHe also accused them of hypocrisy, noting that they do not question rulings by \u201cneo-judges\u201d when it suits their interests. As an example, he pointed to a 2023 case in which \u017burek won in court against a bank in a judgment issued by a judge appointed after the disputed reforms.\n\nZiobro was recently\u00a0[granted asylum by Hungary]( where he fled rather than face charges in Poland for a variety of alleged crimes committed while he was justice minister. He argues that the case against him is an act of \u201cpolitical revenge\u201d by the current government.\n\nAccording to [Prawo.pl]( judges say the case in Gi\u017cycko is far from the first such instance involving family matters such as divorce.\n\nOne unnamed Supreme Court judge said that there is already a line of jurisprudence in the city of Olsztyn under which family law decisions issued by \u201cneo-judges\u201d are treated as legally non-existent.\n\n\u201cSuch rulings show that there is chaos at many levels in the Polish justice system,\u201d said Katarzyna Wr\u00f3bel-Zumbrzycka, a member of Iustitia, a Polish judges\u2019 association that opposed PiS\u2019s reforms. \u201cIt needs to be cleaned up, first and foremost for the people, so that such situations do not happen again.\u201d", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/20/polish-court-rejects-couples-divorce-because-it-was-issued-by-illegitimate-judge/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Syriac-Assyrian Parties Welcome Kurdish Rights Decree, Call for Full Recognition of All Indigenous Communities - The Syrian Observer", "summary": "", "link": "https://syrianobserver.com/syrian-actors/syriac-assyrian-parties-welcome-kurdish-rights-decree-call-for-full-recognition-of-all-indigenous-communities.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
