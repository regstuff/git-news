I want to bounce an idea with you to learn if it's actually viable or if my understanding of fine tuning is still too lacking.\n\nSo there are many coding agents that use big prompts with even more context to make the LLMs tell them what to do. That can get expensive, and also is optimized for LLMs that run on APIs. Local LLMs usually do not understand what the tools want.\n\nSo what if I record my tool usage for like a month (prompt+ response) and use that as training data for fine tuning? Is that feasible?
