To be honest, I was never a very serious student throughout my undergrad(never went to office hours, didn't care much for clubs, minimal participation in class discussions etc) until senior year, where I got involved in research and realized how much I like it. So while I knew I wanted to do a PhD eventually, my undergrad GPA(3.1) and profile was not the best by that point. Still, I managed to get a conference paper published, and that, along with some TA experience and a really good rec letter I was able to get into a research based master's program in NLP.\n  \nNow that I'm about to start my masters in a few months(and honestly matured a lot more when it comes to priorities and work ethic), I wanted to ask if people on here that have gone through the PhD admissions process had some advice for me on how best I can:  \n1. Use these two years to become a competitive application for top programs(think T5 or T10) and\n2. Prepare for the actual day to day work I will be doing as a PhD student.   \n  \nFor further reference, my bachelors is from a developing country, and the master's I'm about to start is in France. For PhDs I want to be targeting schools mostly in the US, but I'm also open to decent departments in other places (I've heard good things about NLP labs at Edinburgh and UToronto). \n\n\nAppreciate any tips or resources you can point me to.
