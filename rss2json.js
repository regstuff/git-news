The idea of having a virtual companion you can talk to, one that controls your environment, answers your questions, and even chats with you, has always been something magical to me.\n\nSo, I decided to build my own.\n\nMeet\u00a0**mIA**\u2014my custom voice assistant, fully integrated into my smart home app! \ud83d\udca1\n\n[\n\nMy goal was simple (well\u2026 not\u00a0*that*\u00a0simple \ud83d\ude05):  \n\u2705\u00a0**Control my home with my voice**  \n\u2705\u00a0**Have natural, human-like conversations**  \n\u2705\u00a0**Get real-time answers\u2014like asking for a recipe while cooking**\n\n[\n\nBut turning this vision into reality came with a ton of challenges. Here\u2019s how I did it, step by step. \ud83d\udc47\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 1\ufe0f The Brain: Choosing mIA\u2019s Core Intelligenc**e\n\nThe first challenge was:\u00a0**What should power mIA\u2019s \u201cbrain\u201d?**  \nAfter some research, I decided to integrate\u00a0**ChatGPT Assistant**. It\u2019s powerful, flexible, and allows API calls to interact with external tools.\n\n* \ud83d\udcda\u00a0[\n\n**Problem:**\u00a0Responses were\u00a0**slow**\u00a0specially when it comes to long answers  \n**Solution:**\u00a0I solved this by using\u00a0**streaming responses**\u00a0from ChatGPT instead of waiting for the entire reply. This way, mIA starts processing and responding as soon as the first part of the message is ready.\n\n**\ud83c\udfa4 2\ufe0f Making mIA Listen: Speech-to-Tex**t\n\nNext challenge:\u00a0**How do I talk to mIA?**  \nWhile GPT-4o supports voice, it\u2019s currently\u00a0**not compatible with the Assistant API**\u00a0for real-time voice processing.\n\nSo, I integrated the\u00a0**speech\\_to\\_text**\u00a0package:\n\n* [\n\nBut I had to:\n\n* **Customize it for French recognition**\u00a0\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\n* **Fine-tune stop detection**\u00a0so it knows when I\u2019m done speaking\n* **Balance edge computing vs. distant processing**\u00a0for speed and accuracy\n\n**\ud83d\udd0a 3\ufe0f Giving mIA a Voice: Text-to-Speec**h\n\nOnce mIA could listen, it needed to\u00a0**speak back**. I chose\u00a0**Azure Cognitive Services**\u00a0for this:\n\n* [*\u00a0*(free tier!)*\n\n**Problem:**\u00a0I wanted mIA to\u00a0**start speaking before ChatGPT had finished generating the entire response**.  \n**Solution:**\u00a0I implemented a\u00a0**queue system**. As ChatGPT streams its reply, each sentence is queued and processed by the text-to-speech engine in real time.\n\n**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f 4\ufe0f Wake Up, mIA! (Wake Word Detection**)\n\nHere\u2019s where things got tricky. Continuous listening with speech\\_to\\_text isn\u2019t possible because it auto-stops after a few seconds. My first solution was a\u00a0**push-to-talk button**\u2026 but let\u2019s be honest, that defeats the purpose of a voice assistant. \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo, I explored\u00a0**wake word detection**\u00a0(like\u00a0*\u201cHey Google\u201d*) and started with\u00a0**Porcupine**\u00a0from Picovoice.\n\n* **Problem:**\u00a0The free plan only supports 3 devices. I have an iPhone, an Android, my wife\u2019s iPhone, and a wall-mounted tablet. On top of that, Porcupine counts both dev and prod versions as separate devices.\n* **Result:**\u00a0Long story short\u2026\u00a0**my account got banned.**\u00a0\ud83d\ude05\n\n**Solution:**\u00a0I switched to\u00a0**DaVoice (\u00a0:\n\n* [\n* [\n\nHuge shoutout to the DaVoice team \ud83d\ude4f\u2014they were incredibly helpful in guiding me through the integration of\u00a0**custom wake word**s.

That simple\u2026  \nHere\u2019s the flow:\n\n1. **The app receives an action request**\u00a0from ChatGPT\u2019s response.\n2. **The app performs the action**\u00a0(like turning on the lights or skipping to next track).\n3. **The app sends back the result**\u00a0(success or failure).\n4. **ChatGPT picks up the conversation**\u00a0right where it left off.\n\nIt feels like\u00a0**sorcery**, but it\u2019s all just API calls behind the scenes. \ud83d\ude04\n\n**\u2764\ufe0f 7\ufe0f Giving mIA Some \u201cPersonality\u201d: Sentiment Analysis**\n\nWhy stop at basic functionality? I wanted mIA to feel more\u2026\u00a0**human**.\n\nSo, I added\u00a0**sentiment analysis**\u00a0using\u00a0**Azure Cognitive Services**\u00a0to detect the emotional tone of my voice.\n\n* If I sound happy, mIA responds more cheerfully.\n* If I sound frustrated, it adjusts its tone.\n\nBonus: I added\u00a0**fun animations**\u00a0using the\u00a0**confetti**\u00a0package to display cute effects when I\u2019m happy. \ud83c\udf89\u00a0(*\n\n**\u2699\ufe0f 8\ufe0f Orchestrating It All: Workflow Management**\n\nWith all these features in place, I needed a way to manage the flow:\n\n* **Waiting \u2192 Wake up \u2192 Listen \u2192 Process \u2192 Act \u2192 Respond**\n\nI built a custom\u00a0**state controller**\u00a0to handle the entire workflow and update the interface to see the assistant listening, thinking or answering.\n\nTo sum up:\n\n**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Talking to mIA Feels Like This**:\n\n\"Hey mIA, can you turn the living room lights red at 40% brightness?\"  \n\"mIA, what\u2019s the recipe for chocolate cake?\"  \n\"Play my favorite tracks on the TV!\"\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly satisfying to interact with mIA like a real companion. I\u2019m constantly teaching mIA new tricks. Over time, the voice interface has become so powerful that the app itself feels almost secondary\u2014I can control my entire smart home, have meaningful conversations, and even just chat about random things.\n\n**\u2753 What Do You Think?**\n\n* Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific part of this setup?\n* Curious about how I integrated facial recognition, API calls, or workflow management?\n* Any suggestions to improve mIA even further?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude80", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1ipwksz/meet_mia_my_custom_voice_assistant_for_smart_home/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Armenia bilateral relations", "summary": "[Joint efforts of Armenia and India directed at promoting international and regional security, peace, and stability \u2013 Suren Papikyan \u2013 Public Radio of Armenia](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1iq3euq/indiaarmenia_bilateral_relations/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MyCoffee v1.4: A Coffee Brewing App for Developers (Now Supporting Temperature)", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/mycoffee", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adani to restore full power to Bangladesh in days but differences remain, say sources", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/adani-restore-full-power-bangladesh-days-differences-remain-say-sources-2025-02-14/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Reddit CEO Says Paywalls Are Coming Soon", "summary": "", "link": "https://gizmodo.com/reddit-ceo-says-paywalls-are-coming-soon-2000564245", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Man Burning Quran Outside Turkish Consulate In London Attacked By Knife", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.news18.com/world/man-burning-quran-outside-turkish-consulate-in-london-attacked-by-knife-9227729.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sheryl Crow Sells Tesla, Donates Proceeds to National Public Radio", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/sheryl-crow-elon-musk-tesla-npr?srsltid=AfmBOorA5-z57ZazCLxChoPAv0gNKpwnlhXjbWaOp1yKNLQjnEgqlOK6", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Bangladesh border talks next week; fencing, attacks by Bangladeshi miscreants on agenda", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-bangladesh-border-talks-fencing-attacks-agenda-9836467/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Last nail in the coffin\u2019: Israeli settlers push on with fresh West Bank land grab \u2022 There are fears that a widely unnoticed displacement of Bedouin has the aim of fragmenting the territory intended for a future Palestinian state", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/last-nail-in-the-coffin-israeli-settlers-push-on-with-fresh-west-bank-land-grab", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Most wanted Dutch drug trafficker, who once faked his own death, killed in Mexico", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dutch-drug-trafficker-marco-ebben-killed-mexico/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Etruscan oinochoe (wine jug) (ca. 550 BCE)", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iq40lz", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Legal threat after Daily Telegraph \u2018antisemitism investigation\u2019 at Cairo Takeaway in Newtown goes wrong", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/legal-threat-after-antisemitism-investigation-goes-wrong-20250214-p5lc6h", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mohammed Yunus invites Elon Musk to Bangladesh, offers territory for Starlink internet", "summary": "", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yunus-invites-musk-to-bangladesh-offers-territory-for-starlink-internet/articleshow/118254604.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Senior UN peacekeeper injured in convoy attack in Lebanon", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdl6d0r2g5o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Muhsin Hendricks, world\u2019s \u2018first openly gay imam\u2019, shot dead in South Africa", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/muhsin-hendricks-worlds-first-openly-gay-imam-shot-dead-in-south-africa", "author": "None"}, {"title": "California farm donates more than 250,000 eggs to wildfire victims and first responders", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-eggs-wildfire-victims-first-responders/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NYC is giving free e-bikes to delivery workers with shoddy or illegal electric bikes", "summary": "", "link": "https://electrek.co/2025/02/12/nyc-is-giving-free-e-bikes-to-delivery-workers-with-shoddy-or-illegal-electric-bikes/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK army 'so run down' it could not lead Ukraine peace force, says former chief", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czep44jn9jyo", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
