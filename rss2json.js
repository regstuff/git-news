Ukrainian nationalists are believed to have killed between 50 and 135 Poles there on the night of 12/13 February 1945.\n\nThat was the place where, in early 2025, Ukraine first\u00a0[gave permission](\u00a0for exhumations to resume.

The news was also confirmed by Polish culture minister Marta Cienkowska.\n\nAccording to the Freedom and Democracy Foundation, a Polish NGO that has led efforts to exhume victims in Puzhnyky, the remains of up to 90 more people may still be buried there.\n\nIts president, Maciej Dancewicz, told broadcaster RMF that work in Puzhnyky will likely resume in the spring. Only once further potential burial sites are discovered can requests be made to Ukraine for further exhumations to take place.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has granted search permits for two other locations in the Volhyn region, also depopulated former villages that were previously part of Poland and known as Ostr\u00f3wki and\u00a0Wola Ostrowiecka.\n\nThe ministry did not provide further details about the aim of those searches, but Ostr\u00f3wki and\u00a0Wola Ostrowiecka\u00a0were neighbouring villages where, on 30 August 1943, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) massacred over 1,000 Poles.\n\nExhumation did previously take place in both places in the 1990s and again in 2011 and 2015, uncovering the remains of hundreds of victims.\n\nIt is believed that many more remain buried in unmarked graves. But, in 2017, Ukraine imposed a ban on searches for massacre victims on its territory in response to the dismantlement of a UPA monument in Poland.\n\nIn its statement this week, the Ukrainian culture ministry noted that \u201cthe tragic pages of the common history of the Ukrainian and Polish peoples in the 20th century remain sensitive for both societies\u201d.\n\nHowever, \u201cconsistent and responsible dialogue on these issues is necessary\u201d because \u201cshared memory strengthens the unity of our peoples\u201d and helps move towards \u201ca common future in the face of the Russian threat\u201d.\n\nIt added that one of the impetuses behind the new permissions was the\u00a0[meeting](\u00a0in December between the two countries\u2019 presidents, Volodymyr Zelensky and Karol Nawrocki.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s chief foreign policy aide, Marcin Przydacz, on Tuesday welcomed the latest decisions as \u201ca good step on the path to achieving a better state of neighbourly relations\u201d. However, he also expressed hope that \u201cprocedures \\[for granting permission\\] will accelerate\u201d.\n\nWhile Ukraine\u2019s decision last year to allow exhumations to resume\u00a0has been welcomed in Poland, some, especially on the political right, have criticised the slow pace. Only in October did Ukraine\u00a0[grant permission](\u00a0for a second set of exhumations to take place.\n\nIn 2022, Poland\u2019s Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) estimated that the remains of around 55,000 ethnic Polish victims and\u00a0[10,000 Jewish ones](\u00a0\u201cstill lie in death pits in Volhynia, waiting to be found, exhumed and buried\u201d.\n\nFurther tensions have been stoked by the fact that Ukraine\u00a0[continues to venerate](\u00a0some of the individuals and groups associated with the massacres, which Poland regards as a genocide.
