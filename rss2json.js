My previous strategy before was to type in a prompt, then follow up with ask questions until it was 99% sure it can complete the task\n\nBoy was I wrong. There were a few things I haven't considered. I've asked the AI to create a better prompt that I can use that will cover ALL my basis, so I will always have the perfect prompt. Here's how the prompt works first before I post it below (the titles are AI, I simplified the description myself).\n\n**1. Role \u2192 Task \u2192 Context \u2192 Constraints \u2192 Format \u2705**\n\nThis recipe is currently the best way to engineer your prompts.\n\n**2. Clarification Before Execution \u2705**\n\nThis prompt puts the AI into different phase modes. Phase 1 forces the AI to interrogate you until it hits 99% confidence before it even attempts to write the prompt.\n\n**3. Few-shot &amp; Counter-example Capture \u2705**\n\nIt's impossible to have the perfect prompt generation on the first try, every time. So this prompt will have the AI give you examples and counter examples in which you will choose is the best one.\n\n**4. Hard Constraints Lock-in \u2705**\n\nThis is mostly about any possible token constraint worries, style, formatting needs, and any disallowed actions.\n\n**5. Self-Contained Final Output \u2705**\n\nThis forces. the bot to give you a final prompt that you can use to give to any new chat and it will work for you right away.\n\n**6. Safety Against Hallucination \u2705**\n\nHallucinations are always a concern with chat bots. That's why part of the protocols include making sure they are as minimized as possible.\n\n**7. Complexity Factor + Auto fix \u2705**\n\nNot all prompts or tasks you want the bot to do are the same. Some tasks are just as simple as teaching something a certain way. Other tasks can be as complex as \"translating legal contracts and summarizing and contrasting jurisdictions\"\n\nWhat the bot will do for you is give you a rating between 1 and 5. The higher the number, the more complex and trouble the bot would have with the task. BUT what it will do is tell you exactly how to get that number to 1 or 2 so you will never run into any unexpected issues.\n\n**Behold, the only prompt you'll ever need.
