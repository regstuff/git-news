Russia says it still has legal right to the property, but that claim is rejected by city hall.\n\nThe Polish foreign ministry\u00a0[ordered the consulate to close](\u00a0by the end of 23 December, with employees required to leave Poland. The Russians, however, plan to leave a single \u201cadministrative and technical employee\u201d at the premises after that date to \u201censure the inviolability\u201d of the building, which they claim is legally theirs.\n\nThe villa on Batorego Street has been occupued by Kremlin diplomats since 1951, when Poland\u2019s communist authorities agreed to allow the Soviets to use the building for free, reports broadcaster TVN.\n\nPreviously, since the times of Tsar Peter the Great, Russia (and later the Soviet Union) had operated a consulate elsewhere in Gda\u0144sk. But it was seized by Nazi Germany in 1941, after Hitler declared war on the Soviet Union, then destroyed in 1945 during the Red Army\u2019s advance into the city.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is our property,\u201d Andrei Ordash, charge d\u2019affaires of the Russian embassy in Warsaw, told TVN. \u201cThis building was transferred to us in the early 1950s as compensation for property lost by the Soviet Union during the war; it is our property.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRussia has maintained this position for years. In 2013, Gda\u0144sk began charging fees for the building\u2019s use, but the consulate refused to pay. The city estimates unpaid fees from 2013 to 2023 at around 5.5 million zloty (\u20ac1.3 million), with interest adding another 3 million zloty.\n\nGda\u0144sk officials call Russia\u2019s position \u201cincomprehensible\u201d, saying that available documentation does not support Moscow\u2019s claims. According to the land and mortgage registers, the building is owned by the Polish state treasury.\n\nThe city\u2019s deputy mayor, Emilia Lodzi\u0144ska, announced on Monday that the city would pursue legal measures to reclaim the property.\n\n\u201cAfter obtaining a court ruling favourable to the Polish side, bailiff proceedings will be carried out, resulting in the seizure of the property,\u201d she said[.](\u00a0\u201cI would like to stress very clearly that we are acting and will continue to act within the framework of a democratic state governed by the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe city emphasised that the building would lose its protected status under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations at midnight on 23 December. However, the city estimates that recovering the building through legal means may in practice take two or three years.\n\n\u201cFollowing a relevant court ruling and transfer to the state treasury, the property will be available for reuse,\u201d said Emil Rojek, deputy governor of the Pomerania province in which Gda\u0144sk is located.\n\n\u201cBefore we make any decisions regarding the future use of this building, we must familiarise ourselves with its technical condition, what we will find there, and examine it in terms of safety. Then we will decide whether this property will be used for the needs of state authorities or in another way, for example commercially,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the municipal authorities in Warsaw\u00a0[seized a former Russian diplomatic compound](\u00a0that had likewise been claimed by Moscow as part of a long-running legal dispute.\n\nWarsaw had initially hoped to hand over the building to the local Ukrainian community. However, that proved unfeasible due to the poor condition of the site. It will instead be\u00a0[redeveloped into housing](\u00a0for municipal employees.\n\nIn 2022, Poland\u2019s State Forests likewise\u00a0[seized a property](\u00a0that Russia had refused to vacate despite failing to pay rent.\n\nSince last year, Poland has successively closed down all three of Russia\u2019s consulates in response to Moscow\u2019s campaign of sabotage on Polish territory. After the Gda\u0144sk consulate ceases to operate tomorrow, only the embassy in Warsaw will remain.\n\nIn retaliation, Moscow has\u00a0[ordered all of Poland\u2019s consulates](\u00a0on its territory to close.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/22/russia-refuses-to-hand-over-consulate-building-after-poland-orders-it-closed/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Islamic State supporters guilty of planning 'most deadly' gun attack on Jewish targets in Manchester", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/islamic-state-supporters-guilty-of-planning-most-deadly-gun-attack-on-jewish-targets-in-manchester-13485467", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine Withdraws From Eastern Town, Complicating Negotiating Stance", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-strikes.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Burkina Faso issues first sentence for 'homosexuality and related practices'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.advocate.com/world/burkina-faso-homosexuality-conviction-africa", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How Israeli covert activities in Syria seek to thwart its new government", "summary": "Article summary:\n\n\ud83d\udccd Israel has been sending weapons to the Hijri forces (Druze forces) since December, 17th 2024\n\n\ud83d\udccdIsraeli official to the Washington Post: We sent weapons confiscated from Hezbollah and Hamas to the Hijri forces.\n\n\ud83d\udccdIsraeli officials to the Washington Post: The SDF transferred half a million dollars to the Hijri forces.\n\n\ud83d\udccdIsraeli official to The Washington Post: We transferred $24,000 to Tariq al-Shoufi, a commander in the Assad regime, via the SDF.\n\n\ud83d\udccdThe Washington Post: Israel pays monthly salaries ranging from $100 to $200 to 3,000 members of the Hijri forces.\n\n\ud83d\udccdIsraeli officials to The Washington Post: Military support for the Hijri forces continues\n\n\ud83d\udccdKurdish officials to The Washington Post: SDF is still training Druze in northeast Syria\n\n\ud83d\udccdAl-Hijri commander to The Washington Post: We got anti-tank missiles from SDF\n\n\ud83d\udccdAl-Hijri commander to The Washington Post: Israel helped us with satellite images in battles against the government\n\n\ud83d\udccdIsraeli official to The Washington Post: We have not yet settled on a policy regarding the Druze in Syria\n\n\ud83d\udccdIsraeli official to The Washington Post: It is not in our interest to create a \u201cDruze state\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udccdWestern official to The Washington Post: Al-Hajri prepared maps for a Druze state extending to Iraq", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/23/israel-covert-activities-syria-druze/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Plane crashes in Ankara with Libyan military chief reportedly on board", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.turkiyetoday.com/nation/plane-crashes-in-ankara-with-libyan-military-chief-reportedly-on-board-3211812", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bribes, TikTok, and escapes through disused pipelines \u2014 Ukraine's SBU reveals 'mobilization evasion schemes'", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/bribes-tiktok-and-escapes-though-disused-pipelines-ukraines-sbu-reveals-mobilization-evasion-schemes/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia escalates attacks on key Ukrainian region of Odesa", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxe8yqlvgzo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Houthis, Yemen government to exchange nearly 3,000 prisoners", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/houthis-yemen-government-to-exchange-nearly-3000-prisoners/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
