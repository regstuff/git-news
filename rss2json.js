Things like agent routing and hand off, unifying access and tracking costs of LLMs, consistent and global observability, implementing protocol support, etc. I call these the low-level plumbing work in building agents.   \n  \nPushing the low-level work into the infrastructure means two things a) you decouple infrastructure features (routing, protocols, access to LLMs, etc) from agent behavior, allowing teams and projects to evolve independently and ship faster and b) you gain centralized governance and control of all agents \u2014 so updates to routing logic, protocol support, or guardrails can be rolled out globally without having to redeploy or restart every single agent runtime.   \n  \nI just shipped multiple agents at T-Mobile in a framework and language agnostic way and designed with this separation of concerns from the get go.
