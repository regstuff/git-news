I have a question for any with interest in Egyptology and the application of new technologies to study ancient structures. I recently became aware of a research paper published in 2022, [\"Synthetic Aperture Radar Doppler Tomography Reveals Details of Undiscovered High-Resolution Internal Structure of the Great Pyramid of Giza\"]( It took a couple reads to fully understand the magnitude of what it was describing: a novel application of Synthetic Aperture Radar to map the interior structure of the Great Pyramid - and in the process, identifying over a dozen previously-unknown internal structures.\n\nNow if you are into this kind of stuff, you probably remember what a big deal it was when the ScanPyramids project announced their discovery of the \"Big Void\" inside the pyramid back in 2017. It was HUGE news. And here, this paper claimed to not only independently confirm the Big Void, but also to identify [several smaller chambers]( including what appear to be connecting passages between known and unknown spaces. [Here's a short video breaking down the proposed internal structures.](\n\nI confess I didn't really understand the technology described in the paper, so I was unable to determine how feasible their findings might be, but I was baffled that I'd never heard of this before. I follow quite a few archaeology news channels and the like, but never heard anything about this. I went looking for any coverage of it - after all, the paper was published in 2022, surely it's been examined by the archaeological community by now? Certainly it was either a massive discovery, or swiftly debunked, right? But to my surprise, it hasn't really received much attention. I emailed a few popular YouTube creators who cover archaeology news but never received any response. \n\nBecause, as it turns out, there's a problem. One of the paper's authors is a dude named Corrado Malanga, [who received a bit of attention on Reddit a few weeks ago]( but not for his pyramid discovery - he's an Italian UFO researcher who has spent his life collecting stories from alien encounters in Italy, and used this data to develop a complex hierarchy of non-human intelligences. He's been around for years and is apparently fairly wellknown in Italy as a guy with some pretty out-there theories. I suspect this is the reason there's been hardly any critical examination of his paper - the academic community has largely written him off as a whack. You can find [videos of Malanga speaking about his pyramid research]( but the conclusion he draws from the data is... well, let's just say it's not exactly supported by scientific or cultural evidence, but I won't say more because I'm not trying to start a debate about any of his fringe ideas. He also seems to have at least *some* standing in the academic community, as he's been affiliated with the Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department at the University of Pisa since the early '80s. \n\nSo I just want to know if his paper has a valid scientific basis. I want to know if there's ANY chance these internal structures are likely to actually exist. A debunking would be totally fine, but it's driving me nuts to think that this *could* potentially be a massive discovery that's been almost entirely ignored by the scientific community for two years. Plenty of brilliant discoveries have been made throughout history by people who had all sorts of uncouth ideas and beliefs. The beliefs shouldn't invalidate the science if the science is valid - though it may very well not be. I just don't know. The whole thing just wasn't sitting well with me, so I'm bringing it to you.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1e35ilk/an_historic_scientific_discovery_of_new_rooms/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan reaches $7 billion aid deal with IMF \u2022 Pakistan has agreed a further IMF aid package as it struggles with high foreign debt and a shortage of tax revenue.
