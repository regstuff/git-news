Their defiance comes more than three years after the killing of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman taken into custody by the \u201cmorality police\u201d for allegedly breaching the dress code rules. Her death led to the largest wave of popular unrest for years in Iran and a crackdown by security services in response, with hundreds of protesters killed and thousands injured.\n\nUnder Iran\u2019s \u201chijab and chastity\u201d law, which came into force in 2024, women caught \u201cpromoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing\u201d face severe penalties, including fines of up to \u00a312,500, flogging, and prison sentences ranging from five to 15 years for repeat offenders.\n\nThe authorities have also encouraged members of the public to become \u201chijab monitors\u201d through a state-backed reporting platform that allows them to report women for alleged violations.\n\nIn December, the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said the hijab was crucial \u201cto preserve the dignity of women and to restrain very strong and [dangerous sexual urges]( heralding the start of a new push to enforce the dress code laws.\n\nWithin days, the security forces intensified their hijab enforcement. The organisers of a popular marathon race in Kish Island, off the southern coast of Iran, [were arrested and accused]( of \u201cviolating public decency\u201d for allowing women to run unveiled.\n\nBut speaking to the Guardian, women in [Iran]( say public opinion has shifted and even more women are open to flouting the dress code rules despite the increase in arrests and penalties.\n\n\u201cWe never needed Khamenei\u2019s permission, nor do we need it now. The scenes you are witnessing are because we do not care what he has to say,\u201d says Hoda\\*, a Tehran-based journalist.\n\nAlthough Hoda accepts that more women will be arrested, she says the Iranian authorities would avoid mass arrests because \u201clast time they did it, they looked like fools across the world\u201d.\n\nIn Tehran, Golnar\\*, a visual artist, believes young Iranians will not return to previous norms. She recently filmed a police officer warning teenagers who were playing music; the group ignored him. She says the regime, weakened by war and sanctions, \u201cneeds good PR\u201d and cannot risk viral images of hijab arrests.\n\n\u201cDo I have it in the back of my head that I will be at any time dragged into a van? Yes, I am not going to lie. But the plan is to push the boundaries collectively, so they can\u2019t break a few of us,\u201d says Golnar.\n\nElsewhere in Tehran, Shaghayegh\\*, 22, pushes boundaries through an all-women motorcycle club. Women cannot obtain bike licences in Iran, yet her group rides weekly. \u201cThey have become very lax and don\u2019t stop us any more,\u201d she says.\n\nShaghayegh says she no longer wears a headscarf off the bike. \u201cIf I wear a hijab now, I feel I\u2019m undoing all the sacrifices so many Iranians have made. There\u2019s no going back.\u201d\n\nWhile most viral videos come from Tehran, women in other provinces also report a shift in attitudes.\n\nLeyla\\*, a business owner in the central Iranian city of Shiraz, says she has never seen the city so energised. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s really hopeful to see. The fact that more and more women choose how they dress is exactly what makes them braver. These visuals are a proof of our bravery and not the reform that many pro-regime folks are pointing to.\u201d\n\nIn Iran\u2019s northern Kurdistan region, Zerin\\*, a student says \u201cmorality police\u201d presence is minimal but broader targeting continues. \u201cIn Kurdistan we are targeted by the authorities for our Kurdish identity and hijab isn\u2019t the only concern.\n\n\u201cI fear when they start enforcing hijab in Tehran, they will use that as an excuse to make mass arrests of our men and women simply over our identity, and make up national security and spy charges like they have been doing before and after Mahsa Amini\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nSkylar Thompson, deputy director of Human Rights Activists in Iran, says the authorities lack the capacity to enforce hijab consistently and are, perhaps, reluctant to confront women amid domestic and international pressures. \u201cThe political, security, and economic climate is fragile and even a small provocation could trigger new unrest.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/24/iran-women-flouting-dress-code-hijab-laws", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Australian State Passes \u2018Extraordinary\u2019 Gun and Protest Laws After Bondi Attack \u2022 While the new restrictions on firearms have broad support, new police powers to crack down on some protests were criticized as limits on civil liberties.", "summary": "The Australian state of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, on Wednesday passed new laws that further restrict gun ownership and empower the police to shut down protests, in response to [last week\u2019s terrorist attack]( on a Hanukkah celebration.\n\nThe state legislation comes just 10 days after the country\u2019s deadliest mass shooting in decades, which left 15 people dead at Bondi Beach in Sydney. It is the first of a slew of actions the country\u2019s leaders have pledged in the wake of the massacre to tighten gun laws, criminalize hate speech and crack down on groups spreading extremist ideology.\n\nThe slate of laws was passed at 3 a.m. after a lengthy debate. Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales, [acknowledged]( that they were \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d that would be controversial, but said they were proportionate and necessary steps to keep the public safe in light of the attack in Bondi.\n\n\u201cSydney and New South Wales have changed forever as a result of that terrorist activity last Sunday,\u201d he [said]( at a news conference following the passage.\n\nThe new laws afford broad powers to police to prohibit and disperse protests for up to 90 days after an incident has been declared terrorism.\n\nThose restrictions were met with concern from lawmakers, activists and some [religious leaders]( that an unfair association was being drawn between the actions of the two gunmen behind the mass shooting, and the largely peaceful protesters expressing concerns about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and criticizing Israel\u2019s conduct in the war.\n\nAmong the laws passed overnight were also measures to criminalize the display of flags of groups deemed terrorist organizations by Australia, including the Islamic State, Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nIn New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, the newly introduced gun restrictions will cap the number of firearms that can be owned by one individual to four, with exceptions for farmers and others in rural areas.\n\nThe state will also audit existing gun licenses and hold a gun buyback program along with the federal government, according to Mr. Minns.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read a copy of the full article here]( in case you can't access the original for whatever reason.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/world/australia/nsw-gun-protest-laws.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Albanese announces tougher hate speech laws in wake of Bondi terror attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-18/albanese-announces-tougher-hate-speech-laws-after-bondi-terror/106157020", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Turkey arrests 115 ISIS members it says were planning Christmas attacks", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/turkey-arrests-115-isis-members-it-says-were-planning-christmas-attacks/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Announcement of semiconductor chip tariffs on Shanghai delayed until 2027", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-impose-tariffs-chips-china-2025-12-23/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Two Tajikistan Border Guards Killed in Attack Launched from Afghanistan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.khaama.com/two-tajikistan-border-guards-killed-in-attack-launched-from-afghanistan/?amp=1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shell facing first UK legal claim over climate impact of fossil fuels", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r9p1ypyjyo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018My blood is boiling, brother\u2019: the foiled plot to massacre Jews on streets of Greater Manchester", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/23/foiled-plot-massacre-jews-greater-manchester", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukrainian foreign minister urges Poland to act against xenophobia after bullying case", "summary": "Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister has called on Poland to impose \u201cfair and exemplary\u201d punishment on those who engage in xenophobic behaviour towards Ukrainians, following reports that a Ukrainian schoolgirl was subjected to abuse at a Warsaw school.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we have to return again and again to the shameful treatment of Ukrainians in Poland. But the approach taken towards Daria is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d wrote Andrii Sybiha on Facebook, adding that Ukrainian authorities were following the case closely.\n\nHis comments refer to the reported bullying of 15-year-old Daria Gladyr, the daughter of Ukrainian volleyball player Yurii Gladyr, by fellow pupils at a private school in the Polish capital. Polish media published recordings in which teenagers can be heard directing verbal abuse at the girl, including xenophobic slurs.\n\nThe case comes amid a broader shift in sentiment in Poland, where polls show growing negative sentiment towards Ukrainians, who are by far Poland\u2019s largest immigrant group.\n\nAccording to Onet Przegl\u0105d Sportowy, which first reported the bullying, the girl was expelled from school, after her parents refused to pay tuition, demanding that the school respond more decisively and separate their daughter from her bullies.\n\nSybiha said he had raised the issue directly with his Polish counterpart, Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s\u00a0[recent visit to Warsaw]( \u201cI received assurances that the Polish side would respond appropriately,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, I insist on just punishment for those who indulge in xenophobic acts against Ukrainians, both in Poland and in other countries. Ukrainians definitely do not deserve such an attitude,\u201d Sybiha said.\n\nYurii Gladyr, a former player for Ukraine\u2019s national volleyball team, is currently playing for a local Polish volleyball club, Aluron CMC Warta Zawiercie. He obtained Polish citizenship in 2013.\n\nWhile Poland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s strongest allies since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, taking in millions of Ukrainian refugees and serving as a key transit route for Western military aid, recent polls suggest that support for Ukraine among Poles has weakened.\n\nAccording to state pollster CBOS, the share of Poles expressing negative views of Ukrainians had increased to 38% in February this year, up from a low of 17% in 2023.\n\nAn October CBOS survey also found that support for accepting Ukrainian refugees had fallen to 48%, the lowest level since the polling began\u00a0[on a regular basis](\u00a0following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and down from a high of 97% in March 2022.\n\nA separate November survey by IBRiS for news website Wirtualna Polska showed that 65.5% of respondents believed Polish-Ukrainian relations had deteriorated in 2025. Regular polling by the Kyiv-based Razumkov Centre has\u00a0[also indicated a decline in Ukrainians\u2019 perceptions of Poles](\n\nTensions between the two countries have flared over issues including[\u00a0blockades of the border by Polish truckers and farmers](\u00a0protesting against cheaper Ukrainian competition and[\u00a0the legacy of the Volhynia massacres](\u00a0during World War Two, in which Ukrainian nationalists killed about 100,000 ethnic Poles.\n\nSybiha noted, however, that preserving good relations remained in the interests of both countries.\n\n\u201cOur nations and our countries deserve neighbourly relations and strategic partnerships. It is in our common interest to prevent and respond to such hostility,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/22/ukrainian-foreign-minister-urges-poland-to-act-against-xenophobia-after-school-bullying-case/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger call for joint 'large-scale operations' against extremists", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/mali-summit-sahel-security-africa-cacd6f9aa5ea89bc112bcba508e5ef77", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Former hostage Romi Gonen recounts repeated sexual assaults by captors in Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/former-hostage-romi-gonen-recounts-repeated-sexual-assaults-by-captors-in-gaza/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pete Hegseth's Awkward Posing With Wife Jennifer Screams Dull Marriage", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thelist.com/2055840/pete-hegseth-wife-jennifer-awkward-posing-moments-dull-marriage/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
