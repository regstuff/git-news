Below, we\u2019ll create a skill that evaluates the likelihood of buying a product from user comments on social media posts, returning a score (1\u2013100) and a short reason. We\u2019ll use a small dataset of comments and instruct the LLM to transform each comment according to our custom specification.\n\n&gt;from flashlearn.skills.learn\\_skill import LearnSkill\n\n&gt;from flashlearn.client import OpenAI\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\\# Instantiate your pipeline \u201cestimator\u201d or \u201ctransformer\u201d, similar to a scikit-learn model\n\n&gt;learner = LearnSkill(model\\_name=\"gpt-4o-mini\", client=OpenAI())\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\\# Provide instructions for the new skill\n\n&gt;skill = learner.learn\\_skill(\n\n&gt;df=\\[\\], # If you want you can also pass in data sample\n\n&gt;task=(\n\n&gt;\"Evaluate how likely the user is to buy my product based on the sentiment in their comment, \"\n\n&gt;\"return an integer 1-100 on key 'likely\\_to\\_buy', \"\n\n&gt;\"and a short explanation on key 'reason'.\"\n\n&gt;),\n\n&gt;)\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\\# Save skill to use in pipelines\n\n&gt;skill.save(\"evaluate\\_buy\\_comments\\_skill.json\")\n\n**Input Is a List of Dictionaries**\n\nWhether the data comes from an API, a spreadsheet, or user-submitted forms, you can simply wrap each record into a dictionary\u2014much like feature dictionaries in typical ML workflows. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n&gt;user\\_inputs = \\[\n\n&gt;{\"comment\\_text\": \"I love this product, it's everything I wanted!\"},\n\n&gt;{\"comment\\_text\": \"Not impressed... wouldn't consider buying this.\"},\n\n&gt;\\# ...\n\n&gt;\\]\n\n**Run in 3 Lines of Code - Concurrency built-in up to 1000 calls/min**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve defined or learned a skill (similar to creating a specialized transformer in a standard ML pipeline), you can load it and apply it to your data in just a few lines:\n\n&gt;\\# Suppose we previously saved a learned skill to \"evaluate\\_buy\\_comments\\_skill.json\".  \nwith open(\"evaluate\\_buy\\_comments\\_skill.json\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as file:   \ndefinition= json.load(file)\n\n&gt;skill = GeneralSkill.load\\_skill(definition)\n\n&gt;tasks = skill.create\\_tasks(user\\_inputs)\n\n&gt;results = skill.run\\_tasks\\_in\\_parallel(tasks)\n\n&gt;print(results)\n\n**Get Structured Results**\n\nThe library returns structured outputs for each of your records. The keys in the results dictionary map to the indexes of your original list. For example:\n\n&gt;{\n\n&gt;\"0\": {\n\n&gt;\"likely\\_to\\_buy\": 90,\n\n&gt;\"reason\": \"Comment shows strong enthusiasm and positive sentiment.\"\n\n&gt;},\n\n&gt;\"1\": {\n\n&gt;\"likely\\_to\\_buy\": 25,\n\n&gt;\"reason\": \"Expressed disappointment and reluctance to purchase.\"\n\n&gt;}\n\n&gt;}\n\n**Pass on to the Next Steps**\n\nEach record\u2019s output can then be used in downstream tasks. For instance, you might:\n\n1. Store the results in a database\n2. Filter for high-likelihood leads\n3. .....\n\nBelow is a small example showing how you might parse the dictionary and feed it into a separate function:\n\n&gt;\\# Suppose 'flash\\_results' is the dictionary with structured LLM outputs\n\n&gt;for idx, result in flash\\_results.items():\n\n&gt;desired\\_score = result\\[\"likely\\_to\\_buy\"\\]\n\n&gt;reason\\_text = result\\[\"reason\"\\]\n\n&gt;\\# Now do something with the score and reason, e.g., store in DB or pass to next step\n\n&gt;print(f\"Comment #{idx} =&gt; Score: {desired\\_score}, Reason: {reason\\_text}\")\n\n**Comparison**  \nFlashlearn is a lightweight library for people who do not need high complexity flows of LangChain.\n\n1. **FlashLearn -** Minimal library meant for well defined us cases that expect structured outputs\n2. **LangChain -** For building complex thinking multi-step agents with memory and reasoning\n\nIf you like it, give us a star: [Github link](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1iju8a2/use_llms_like_scikitlearn/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GRPO (Reasoning) now in Unsloth!", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/gxgrjj8q6khe1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What tools exist for rapidly comparing speech to text tools", "summary": "Hundreds of people must embark on speech to their evaluations and comparisons every day.

But still I was mostly learning from youtube for tje basics. My language study was messy, as i had to focus on all the skills and also had only an hour of time i could give for studying. I used duolingo but it was not the best experience for me even as a beginner. \n\nThen after getting the basics of the language i used chatgpt to plan my sessions(monthly and weekly) to have a clarity and achieve my monthly goals. It does a good job but it did not adapt to my learning style or even give me that positive dopamine from achieving my goals. \n\nMost language learners are using chatgpt for the same reason(its what i have seen) and also for pronunciation and to correct writings\n\nWhich is exactly what I am working on to solve. For the mvp I am focusing on- \n1. The planning features( better version)  \n2. Helping you get the basics for a language for all skills. \n3. Set and achieve your weekly and monthly goals. \n4. Select any text while studying and save in your vocabulary to study later\n\nAnd yes, it is an AI powered app, and i want to also create in-depth content for studying.(a better version of duolingo) \nIf you are interested to test the app, join our waitlist and answer some questions. \n", "link": "https://forms.gle/pbguJgYLj8K1TS3Q7", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Autopen: a token-tree text editor that lets you see your text through an LLM's eyes, generate and explore alternatives in place", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/blackhole89/autopen", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Centre silent on Trump order cancelling Chabahar port waiver", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-silent-on-trump-order-cancelling-chabahar-port-waiver/article69189011.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "i would love to get into archaeogenetics. how do i?", "summary": "im 16 but i would DIEEEE to study ancient dna, as i literally love genetics. i live in the uk but i feel like theres no ways into it. am i just blind or is it a really niche industry?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ijmyqs/i_would_love_to_get_into_archaeogenetics_how_do_i/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "U.K. firm cracks the code to convert harmful methane emissions into useful hydrogen and graphene", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/methane-turned-into-hydrogen-and-graphene-uk-firm-levidian-climate-change/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "In 2004, it took the world a year to add a gigawatt of solar power \u2014 now it takes a day", "summary": "", "link": "https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/in-2004-it-took-the-world-a-year-to-add-a-gigawatt-of-solar-power-now-it-takes-a-day", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Revealing India\u2019s Cold War secrets", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/revealing-india-s-cold-war-secrets", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scholarships or Funding for a Graduate Program Abroad", "summary": "Hi!
