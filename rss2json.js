An engine trained primarily on global, generalized English data will inherently struggle with the specific, messy nuances of a kitchen in Binh Thanh District.\n\nIt wasn't that the engine was bad; it's that it wasn't built for *this* specific acoustic environment. We tried to force it, and we paid for that mismatch in time and frustration.\n\n# Why DaVoice Became Our Practical Choice\n\nMy team started looking for hyper-specialized solutions. We connected with **DaVoice**, a team focused on solving wake word challenges in non-English, high variation languages.\n\nTheir pitch wasn't about platform scale; it was about precision:\n\n&gt;\n\nThat approach resonated deeply. We shifted our focus from platform integration to data collection:\n\n* **14 different Vietnamese speakers.**\n* **3\u20134 variations** from each (different tone, speed, noise).\n* Sent the dataset, and they delivered a custom model **in under 48 hours.**\n\nWe put it straight into a real restaurant during peak rush hour (plates, hissing, shouting, fans). The result?\n\n* **97% real-world wake word accuracy.**\n\n  \n*For those curious about their wake word technology, here\u2019s their site:*\n\n[**\n\nThis wasn't theoretical lab accuracy. This was the level of reliability needed to make a voice-activated POS actually viable.\n\n# Practical Comparison: No \"Winner,\" Just the Right Fit\n\nIn the real world of building products, you choose the tool that fits the constraint.\n\n|**Approach**|**The Pro**|**The Real World Constraint**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Build In-House**|Total technical control.|Requires huge datasets of local, diverse voices (too slow, too costly).|\n|**Use Big Vendors**|Stable, scalable, documented (Excellent tools like Picovoice).|Optimized for generalized, global languages; local accents become expensive edge cases.|\n|**Use DaVoice**|Trained exactly on our user voices; fast iteration and response.|We are reliant on a small, niche vendor for ongoing support.|\n\nThat dependency turned out to be a major advantage. They treated our unique accent challenge as a core problem to solve, not a ticket in a queue. **Most vendors give you a model; DaVoice gave us a responsive partnership.**\n\nWhen you build voice tech for real-world applications, the \"best\" tool isn't the biggest, it's the one that adapts fastest to how people *really* talk.\n\n# Final Thought: Wake Words are Foundation, Not Feature\n\nA voice product dies at the wake word. It doesn't fail during the complex NLP phase.\n\nIf the system doesn't activate precisely when the user says the command, the entire pipeline is useless:\n\n* Not the intent parser\n* Not the entity extraction\n* Not the UX\n* Not the demo video\n\nAll of it collapses.\n\nFor our restaurant POS, that foundation had to be robust, noise-resistant, and hyperlocal. In this case, that foundation was built with DaVoice. Not because of marketing hype, but because that bowl of *ph\u1edf* needs to get into the cart the second someone shouts the order\n\n# If You\u2019re Building Voice Tech, Let's Connect.\n\nI'm keen to share insights on:\n\n* Accent modeling and dataset creation.\n* NLP challenges in informal/slang-heavy speech.\n* Solving high noise environmental constraints.\n\nIf we keep building voice tech outside the English-first bubble, the next wave of AI might actually start listening to how *we* talk, not just how we're told to.

The ruling requires Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe case in question was brought by two men \u2013 one a Polish citizen, the other a dual Polish-German national \u2013 who married in Berlin in 2018. When they sought to have their union recognised in Poland, they were refused, first by the registry office and then by courts, which cited article 18 of Poland\u2019s constitution.\n\nThat article states: \u201cMarriage as a union of a man and a woman, family, motherhood and parenthood shall be placed under the protection and care of the Republic of Poland.\u201d\n\nBy 2023, the case had reached Poland\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court (NSA), which\u00a0[decided to ask the CJEU](\u00a0to issue a ruling. That decision was itself seen as groundbreaking, as until then Polish courts had refused to refer such cases to the EU level.\n\nIn April this year, CJEU advocate general Richard de la Tour issued an opinion finding that EU law requires member states to recognise same-sex marriages conducted in other member states.\n\nWhile such opinions are not binding, the CJEU usually follows them in its subsequent rulings. And, today, the the court did indeed rule along those lines. Its judges noted that, while individual member states have the right to set their own rules relating to marriage, they are also required to comply with EU law.\n\n\u201cThe spouses in question, as EU citizens, enjoy the freedom to move and reside within the territory of the member states and the right to lead a normal family life when exercising that freedom and upon returning to their member state of origin,\u201d wrote the CJEU.\n\n\u201cIn particular, when they create a family life in a host member state, in particular by virtue of marriage, they must have the certainty to be able to pursue that family life upon returning to their member state of origin,\u201d it added.\n\nRefusing to allow them to do so is contrary to EU law, ruled the judges, as it infringes on their right to move and reside, as well as respect for private and family life.\n\nThe court added that its ruling \u201cdoes not undermine the national identity or pose a threat to the public policy of the spouses\u2019 member state of origin\u201d, and also \u201cdoes not require that member state to provide for marriage between persons of the same sex in its national law\u201d.\n\nIt said that it still remains up to member states what kind of procedure they want to have for recognising marriages conducted abroad. However, that procedure \u201cmust not render such recognition impossible or excessively difficult or discriminate against same-sex couples on account of their sexual orientation\u201d.\n\nPolish LGBT+ rights group Mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 Nie Wyklucza welcomed today\u2019s \u201clong-awaited ruling\u201d, which it said \u201cleaves no doubt: under EU law, Poland is obligated to issue marriage certificates to Polish couples married in another EU country!\u201d\n\nThe organisation will later on Tuesday hold a press conference outside the digital affairs ministry, which is responsible for the process of recognising foreign marriages, to present proposals for how the CJEU\u2019s ruling can be implemented.\n\nPolish law currently does not allow any form of recognised same-sex union. However, opinion polls show that a\u00a0[large majority of the public](\u00a0support the introduction of same-sex civil partnerships.\n\nIn December 2023, the European Court of Human Rights\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0that Poland\u2019s lack of legal recognition and protection for same-sex couples violates their human rights\n\nMost parties in the current rulign coalition\u00a0[favour introducing same-sex civil partnerships]( However, their proposals have faced opposition from more conservative elements in the government and also a certain veto from right-wing, opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki.\n\nLast month, in an effort at compromise, the ruling coalition\u00a0[presented a new bill](\u00a0that would not specifically introduce civil partnerships, but would allow unmarried partners, including same-sex couples, to sign an agreement granting them certain rights.\n\nAfter the plans were unveiled, Nawrocki said that he would not sign any bill that \u201cundermines the unique and constitutionally protected status of marriage\u201d but that he was \u201copen to discussion\u201d about measures to \u201chelp people,\u00a0regardless of their gender, relationships, or age, to manage certain matters\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/25/eu-court-orders-poland-to-recognise-same-sex-marriages-conducted-in-other-member-states/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland charges Ukrainian with assisting in Russian rail sabotage", "summary": "Polish prosecutors have charged a Ukrainian man with assisting in the recent sabotage of a rail line in Poland on behalf of Russia.

After charges were filed, he was questioned by prosecutors as a suspect and a court approved his further detention.\n\nOn 18 November, two days after\u00a0[the sabotage was discovered]( Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that it had been carried out by two Ukrainians working on behalf of Russia, who had immediately fled over the border into Belarus.\n\nThe following day, prosecutors named them the pair as Oleksandr K. and Yevhenii I., in keeping with Polish privacy law. However, Polish media outlets have fully identified the suspects as Yevhenii Ivanov and Oleksandr Kononov.\n\nProsecutors have drafted charges against the pair and, on 20 November, Poland issued a diplomatic note to Belarus asking that it hand them over.
