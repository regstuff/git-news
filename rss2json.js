Throughout my career I've most enjoyed mentoring people and helping to place them in jobs that are good fits, wherever those may be. I've seen some common themes in career questions posted here and in related subs. My two cents below. Hope this helps. \n\n- Resume/CV and cover letter: spend 10 minutes to tailor to the firm you're targeting. Double check. I can't tell you how many times I've received a letter addressed to a competitor. \n\n- Interview: be genuine. Admit if you're unfamiliar with an app, piece of tech, artifact type, etc. I look for people who can ask smart questions and learn, not people who know everything. Don't be afraid to think out loud. That's actually the point of questions such as, \"tell me about a time when a project didn't go as planned and how you handled it.\" In my opinion those are the most illuminating interview conversations of all. \n\n- Dress: dependent on region and level. The general advice to dress for the next level up is sound. Business casual is usually fine for mid and senior. For field/ entry level, I'm fine with clean field wear. Just not pajamas or shorts and a dirty t-shirt. Those are real examples. \n\n- Be realistic about expectations. The absolute height of the US CRM market was probably 2020-2024. Salaries and perks seem to have softened a little since then. If you are applying for a field-heavy job (like 75% travel), don't insist you'll only be available for 25% travel. That doesn't fit with the interviewer's needs. (Note: I'm talking about a position-specific interview above. I've always been willing to have a more informal, open introductory chat with a potential future candidate, and have crafted positions to match such constraints after realizing, \"wow, we need this person onboard somehow.\")\n\n- References: for me, very important. I usually ask things like, \"Does X take criticism well? How does X work with a team?\" I take it all with a grain of salt (keeping in mind possible sexist/racist/etc assumptions on the part of the supervisor), but a great reference showing potential for learning and growth can make the difference for someone with minimal experience. \n\n- Technical experience and capabilities: specific to region, contract type, etc; others in this sub have addressed better than I could. \n\n- Passion: do you need it? I don't know. I'm not particularly passionate--like OMG THIS IS MY PURPOSE--about any of the work I've done. Maybe that coldness makes me good at the business side. I have seen passion put people into Magnum Opus mode and prevent them from doing efficient, profitable work. Then again, it's what you do with it. I guess I enjoy CRM because I can find something interesting in any type of resource, and I enjoy solving problems. Maybe that's passion after all. \n\n- Mindset: don't marinate in negativity and toxicity. It's so easy to shift from commiserating to spiraling. Think about the stories you tell yourself and others; I recommend Hidden Brain for this:  Also, try to cultivate a sense of self-efficacy, which is different (and I think healthier and more realistic) than chasing self-esteem, especially when you've had some negative experiences. I recommend Jen Kirkman's podcast for this ( and also for general info about neurodivergence such as autism and ADHD, which are extra-common in archaeology and can have real benefits (hyperfocus, etc). Someone very close to me speculated that my colleagues and I like people of the past because there's a safe distance from them, while living people make us uncomfortable. That feels very true. Uncomfortably so!\n\n- There are lots of career tips on the CRM Archaeology Podcast ( Classes, field schools, writing, resumes, job searches, best practices, etc. I've been recommending this podcast for years to prospective CRM archies and those who want to rise in the industry. But that brings me to caveats...\n\nCAVEATS\n\n- My own university, field school, and formal interview experiences as a candidate were many years ago. Maybe I'm fooling myself by thinking that those experiences can help navigate the current job market.  The hosts of the CRM Arch podcast episode referenced above make that point multiple times, but then one of the hosts still seems to make that mistake when dispensing advice. I could believe I'm doing that as well. \n- I am a cis/het white dude and present obviously as such. I know there is much more danger in someone who is female, another ethnicity, etc. in, say, taking my advice above and admitting they don't know something. Or in appearing too aggressive/confident. I try to be aware of these factors in my own decisions but have grown up in a biased culture. I'm sure there's more of that baked into me than I recognize.\n- Most of my own experience as an employee and an employer has been in small, privately-held companies with little or no formal HR gatekeeping.\n- I'm in the southern US.\n\nI hope this is helpful. I welcome your thoughts.

From what I can tell, If you've got any kind of data living in a Microsoft tenant, The Graph API most likely has the ability to connect to it. The cool part that has got me excited is that once you are authenticated via Microsoft Entra-ID then you can pretty much get to all data for everything your user account has access to. \n\nThis has HUGE potential use cases in my opinion, especially once connected to a local LLM as an MCP server. You could literally RAG on all your email, Teams chats, OneDrive documents. The graph API can also accept POST methods so, if you're really brave, you could have it write data back to the API. I guess for setting appointments, making changes to files, sending e-mails, etc. My imagination is running wild with the potential prompts you could run (although I'm definitely not brave enough to try the POST method stuff yet).\n\nI am already authenticating Azure users to Open WebUI using OAUTH, and its working pretty fantastic, so I'm thinking if I could get ahold of a decent Microsoft Graph API MCP server, then each Open WebUI user could be authenticated to MS Graph API (by passing their security token to it or whatever) and then the MCP server could go to the Microsoft Graph API (on their behalf) and pull only the data that they have permissions to view. So essentially, they could search through their own e-mails, MS Teams chats, all kinds of crazy stuff. \n\nFrom a high-level, this whole thing seems possible, but what I don't know is how Open WebUI handles MCP server calls from individual users. Will it pass the user MS Entra-id auth info on to the MCP server and then the MCP server makes the call to the Microsoft Graph API on that user's behalf?  Can Open WebUI and MCPs tool servers even deal with per user credentials like what I'm envisioning?\n\nSo say I get past this part, the other hurdle is that some parts of the Microsoft Graph API requires users to consent to allowing API access to particular sets of data in the graph. Example: you have to agree that you're going to allow the Graph API to access your e-mail on your behalf and stuff like that.  So somehow, I'm assuming, when consent is required for a particular part of the Graph API, it's going to want to pop up a consent request window so they can agree to consent. Is Open WebUI going to know what to do with this? Can I use its event handling feature to deal with this?\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to want to do something like this, so that's why I'm posting here to ask the question: Has anyone successfully connected Open WebUI to Microsoft Graph API using an MCP server or any other method? We're you able to do so on a per user basis where you could pass the Entra-ID information to the Graph API MCP?  How did you handle the consent requests?\n\nAny help or feedback is appreciated.
