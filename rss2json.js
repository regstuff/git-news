How do you structure your prompts to minimize errors and get *exactly* what you want? My biggest struggle is when the AI needs to analyze GitHub repositories (large or small). After a few iterations, it starts forgetting the code's content, replies in the wrong language (even after I've specified one), begins to hallucinate, or says things like, \"...assuming you have this method in file.xx...\" when I either created that method with the AI in previous responses or it's clearly present in the repository for review.\n\nHow do you craft your prompts to reasonably control these kinds of situations? Any ideas?\n\nI always try to follow these rules, for example, but it doesn't consistently pan out. It'll lose context, or inject unwanted comments regardless, and so on:\n\n# Communication and Response Rules\n\n1. Always respond in **English**.\n2. **Do not add comments** under any circumstances in the source code (like # comment). Only use **docstrings** if it's necessary to document functions, classes, or modules.\n3. **Do not invent functions, names, paths, structures, or libraries.** If something cannot be directly verified in the repository or official documentation, **state it clearly**.\n4. **Do not make assumptions**. If you need to verify a class, function, or import, **actually search for it in the code** before responding.\n5.
