(Yes/No)\n\n* Regardless, proceed to 1.3\n\n1.3 Are the emission reduction targets aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C? (Yes/No)\n\n* Regardless, reference supporting evidence\n\nAnd so on, leading to more questions and open-ended responses like:\n\n* \"Explain how locked-in emissions impact the organization's ability to meet its emission reduction targets.\"\n* \"Describe the organization's strategies to manage locked-in emissions.\"\n\nThe extracted information from the bills and questionnaires will be used to answer these questions. However, my main issue is designing a method to take this extracted information and systematically map it to the placeholders in the report based on the decision tree.\n\nI have an idea in mind, but always like to have others' insights. Would appreciate your opinion on:\n\n1. Structuring the logic to take extracted data and answer the decision-tree questions reliably.\n2. Mapping answers to the corresponding sections of the report.\n3. Automating the process where possible (e.g., using rules, NLP, or other techniques).\n\nHas anyone worked on something similar? What approaches would you recommend for efficiently structuring and automating this process?\n\nThanks in advance!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1iebu89/p_project_document_information_extraction_and/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kassite inscribed brick (ca. 1216\u20131187 BCE)", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/63044brztdge1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ERP in development with Laravel and Livewire", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/oitcode/samarium", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is Unsloth getting involved with OpenR1?", "summary": "Hey guys, just wondering if you have any plans to get involved with OpenR1 project?
