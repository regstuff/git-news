This was the kind of thing that the [IBM alignment models]( were designed to do. In those models, usually there was a chicken-and-egg problem where you needed to know how to translate individual words in order to get the alignment, but in order to get the table of word translations, you needed some texts that were aligned. The IBM models were intended to bootstrap their way through this problem.\n\nBy \"coarse-grained,\" I mean that I care about matching up a sentence or paragraph in a book with its counterpart in a translation -- not fine-grained alignment, like matching up the word \"dog\" in English with the word \"perro\" in Spanish.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the IBM models worked well on certain language pairs like English-German, but not on more dissimilar language pairs such as the one I've been working on, which is English and ancient Greek. Then neural networks came along, and they worked so well for machine translation between so many languages that people stopped looking at the \"classical\" methods.\n\nHowever, my experience is that for many tasks in natural language processing, the neural network techniques really don't work well for grc and en-grc, which is probably due to a variety of factors (limited corpora, extremely complex and irregular inflections in Greek, free word order in Greek). Because of this, I've ended up writing a lemma and POS tagger for ancient Greek, [which greatly outperforms]( NN models, and I've recently had some success building on that to make [a pretty good bitext alignment code]( which works well for this language pair and should probably work well for other language pairs as well, provided that some of the infrastructure is in place.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm pretty sure that other people must have been accomplishing similar things using NN techniques, but I wonder whether that is all taking place behind closed doors, or whether it's actually been published. For example, Claude seems to do quite well at translation for the en-grc pair, but AFAICT it's a completely proprietary system, and outsiders can only get insight into it by reverse-engineering. I would think that you couldn't train such a model without starting with some en-grc bitexts, and there would have to be some alignment, but I don't know whether someone like Anthropic did that preparatory work themselves using AI, did it using some classical technique like the IBM models, paid Kenyans to do it, ripped off github pages to do it, or what.\n\nCan anyone enlighten me about what is considered state of the art for this task these days? I would like to evaluate whether my own work is (a) not of interest to anyone else, (b) not particularly novel but possibly useful to other people working on niche languages, or (c) worth writing up and publishing.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1hof5du/what_are_people_using_these_days_for/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
