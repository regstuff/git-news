There's probably a notable gap even when compared to the UK and France (it seems India hasn\u2019t fully mastered hydrogen bomb technology yet), and it might even be behind North Korea. This discrepancy is clearly at odds with India's status as a major power and its future ambitions. Naturally, one might think that India should resume nuclear testing at the right time to catch up, aiming at least to surpass the UK and France. In the long run, catching up with the U.S., China, and Russia should also be part of the plan.\n\nHowever, the issue of Pakistan stands in India's way. When India conducted nuclear tests in the late '90s, Pakistan immediately responded with tests of the same magnitude. This was quite remarkable. It not only demonstrated Pakistan\u2019s nuclear capability but also its ability to monitor India\u2019s nuclear activities. Many believe that Pakistan didn\u2019t achieve this alone and had help from other nuclear powers, possibly more than one.\n\nFor India, this situation is quite painful. If India resumes nuclear testing to catch up with other nuclear powers, will history repeat itself? Will Pakistan upgrade its nuclear capabilities step by step as India progresses? Don't worry about Pakistan's own capabilities; other nuclear powers have ample reasons to help Pakistan upgrade and monitor India\u2019s nuclear activities, and there\u2019s more than one major power with this motivation. I even suspect that the main reason India has refrained from resuming nuclear testing over the past two decades is this balance imposed by Pakistan.\n\nFrom India's perspective, Pakistan isn\u2019t even in the same league. Moreover, India\u2019s development trajectory has been clearly better over the years. If India continues steadily, its advantage over Pakistan will grow, which should be part of India\u2019s long-term strategy. But if Pakistan were to upgrade its nuclear capabilities in response to India\u2019s tests, this would elevate Pakistan\u2019s security forces to a level its national strength wouldn\u2019t otherwise justify, creating a new balance of power that India hadn\u2019t planned for. This is something India would find very hard to accept.\n\nThus, India faces a dilemma. If it doesn\u2019t resume large-scale nuclear testing, it will always have a significant gap compared to the countries it wants to compete with. If it does proceed with extensive nuclear tests, Pakistan, a country that should have a significant gap with India, will maintain and continually upgrade its nuclear capabilities to match India. Either option is extremely painful for India. This is the Pakistani Nuclear Chain, and it\u2019s a very strong chain.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the best choice for India is. If I were Indian, I\u2019d be deeply troubled by this too. But what\u2019s more concerning is that I suspect many Indians might not even be aware of this nuclear chain. Perhaps at the right moment, Modi should explain the truth to the Indian people and initiate a national discussion. This way, whatever path India chooses in the future, the inevitable costs will be something the people are willing to bear after thorough discussion.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1d48rid/the_pakistani_nuclear_chain/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Koreshanity: Cyrus Teed and the Story of a Civil War Doctor who became a  Hollow Earth Theorist and Floridian Cult Leader", "summary": "", "link": "https://creativehistorystories.blogspot.com/2024/05/koreshanity-cyrus-teed-and-story-of.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kidnap, Brainwash, Militarize\u2014the Playbook of\u00a0Russia\u2019s War on\u00a0Ukrainian Children", "summary": "", "link": "https://united24media.com/war-in-ukraine/kidnap-brainwash-militarize-the-playbook-of-russias-war-on-ukrainian-children-246", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Question about Jalisco Culture Ceramic Figures", "summary": "Standing female figurine made of pottery 200BC-500.

Check out** [**this Github repo**]( **for download and installation instructions.**\n\nHi, for my data science bachelor\u2019s thesis I\u2019ve been developing a browser extension with a new approach to fight distractions. Instead of specifying apps or keywords to match, you briefly write down your task, what you need for it and what usually distracts you. Then, tab and program titles are continously evaluated for how distracting they are in regard to this description - completely offline on your device, nobody is monitoring you. The extension is designed to be neurodiversity-friendly, particularly in regards to ADHD, autism and demand avoidance. If you get distracted, one of 3 interventions will be triggered automatically:\n\n* a chatbot to help you get back on track\n* all distracting tabs are automatically identified and you\u2019ll be offered to close or save them for later\n* Firefox only: nudging you by coloring the toolbar depending on your distraction level\n\nAdditionally, you can check out your score history in a dashboard. Here are some potential use cases for this approach:\n\n* you need to browse some distracting website for a task, but also procrastinate there\n* you find yourself overwhelmed with dozens of tabs open and want to sort out all the distracting ones with one click\n* you are stuck in a hole of executive dysfunction or inertia and need a push to get out of it\n* you\u2019ve been using nudging tools but got annoyed about staring at a green screen for 10 seconds when you just need to take a quick look somewhere\n* you\u2019ve tried other blocking tools but found yourself sabotaging them out of frustration about rules being incompatible with reality\n\nI\u2019m looking for volunteers to test this extension. If you complete the full study (12 days for Firefox / 9 days for other browsers), **you\u2019ll be eligible to participate in a raffle in which two winners will receive 20\u20ac each**. All you have to do is occasionally interacting with short self report prompts and the interventions. Every 3 days, the type of intervention that is triggered (of the ones listed above) changes, finished by a baseline period. Some very limited data will be transmitted back to me for research during the study, see the Privacy section in the Github repo for details.\n\nThanks for reading this far, and let me know if you have any other questions or feedback.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1d3yit4/looking_for_study_participants_to_test_a_semantic/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenAI upgrades free ChatGPT with internet access and more", "summary": "1/ OpenAI has enhanced the free ChatGPT with features such as internet access, image analysis, data analysis, file upload and custom chatbots that were previously only available in the Plus version.
