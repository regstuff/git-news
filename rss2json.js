As someone deeply immersed in developing prompting techniques for Claude and other LLMs, I've noticed a significant shift away from simple instruction-based prompting toward more sophisticated approaches that leverage the increased capabilities of modern AI systems.\n\n\n\nIn this post, I'll share several cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques that have dramatically improved my results with the latest LLMs. These approaches go beyond the standard \"role + task + format\" template that dominated early prompt engineering discussions.\n\n\n\n\\## 1. Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting\n\n\n\nOne of the most powerful techniques I've been experimenting with is what I call \"Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting\" (RSIP). This approach leverages the model's ability to critique and improve its own outputs iteratively.\n\n\n\n\\### How it works:\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\n\nI need you to help me create \\[specific content\\]. Follow this process:\n\n\n\n1. Generate an initial version of \\[content\\]\n\n2. Critically evaluate your own output, identifying at least 3 specific weaknesses\n\n3. Create an improved version addressing those weaknesses\n\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 two more times, with each iteration focusing on different aspects for improvement\n\n5. Present your final, most refined version\n\n\n\nFor your evaluation, consider these dimensions: \\[list specific quality criteria relevant to your task\\]\n\n\\\\\\\n\n\n\nI've found this particularly effective for creative writing, technical documentation, and argument development. The key is specifying different evaluation criteria for each iteration to prevent the model from fixating on the same improvements repeatedly.\n\n\n\n\\## 2. Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD)\n\n\n\nLLMs often struggle with complex multi-part tasks that require careful reasoning. Context-Aware Decomposition is a technique that breaks down complex problems while maintaining awareness of the broader context.\n\n\n\n\\### Implementation example:\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\n\nI need to solve the following complex problem: \\[describe problem\\]\n\n\n\nPlease help me by:\n\n\n\n1. Identifying the core components of this problem (minimum 3, maximum 5)\n\n2. For each component:\n\n   a. Explain why it's important to the overall problem\n\n   b. Identify what information or approach is needed to address it\n\n   c. Solve that specific component\n\n3. After addressing each component separately, synthesize these partial solutions, explicitly addressing how they interact\n\n4. Provide a holistic solution that maintains awareness of all the components and their relationships\n\n\n\nThroughout this process, maintain a \"thinking journal\" that explains your reasoning at each step.\n\n\\\\\\\n\n\n\nThis approach has been revolutionary for solving complex programming challenges, business strategy questions, and intricate analytical problems. The explicit tracking of relationships between components prevents the \"tunnel vision\" that often occurs with simpler decomposition approaches.\n\nto be continued ....  \ntell me in the comments which of these tech you love most :)   \nif you are interested about my work you can follow me in [ you can find free prompts for several niches :) Happy Friday ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k7jrt7/advanced_prompt_engineering_techniques_for_2025/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Give Your Local LLM Superpowers! \ud83d\ude80 New Guide to Open WebUI Tools", "summary": "Hey r/OpenWebUI,\n\nJust dropped the next part of my Open WebUI series.

Narratives Are Global. Victimhood Is Currency. Use It Wisely.\n\nCompare Kashmir to Palestine. The world sees Palestinians as victims because they have mastered the art of framing. Their identity is wrapped in the language of displacement, heritage, injustice, and struggle. Their cause is portrayed through centuries-old cultural roots and modern imagery of suffering.\n\nNow consider Kashmir. The name itself derives from Rishi Kashyapa, deeply intertwined with Indian civilization. For centuries, the valley was a cradle of Indic knowledge, temples, saints, literature, and philosophy while for the last few centuries each and every part of Kashmir's history was destroyed and the exodus happened for centuries to various parts of India. Even post-independence, the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits, cultural destruction, and continued targeting based on religion remain undeniable facts.\nWe have all the more than reason to exist in Kashmir all based on same logic given by Palestinians.\nAnd yet, how often do Indians present this pain with poise, clarity, and empathy?\n\nRarely. Instead, many jump to emotional tirades, baying for war and annihilation. In a world where perception trumps position, such outbursts hand the mic to your enemies.\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate: when Hamas supporters chant \u201cfrom the river to the sea,\u201d they are widely perceived as extremists. But when the smart people among the Palestine causes showed the reality through images, with captain, \"All Eyes on Rafah.\" and the image moved the world.\nMany in India who might have ignored the terrorist attack or the motivation behind it have posted on Rafah.\n\nNow reverse the lens. Some Indians write, \u201cmix poison in the rivers\u201d or post genocidal memes aimed at an entire country that's already dying. Not only is this, irrational, but strategically suicidal. You don\u2019t look strong\u2014you look unhinged. Despite the terrorist targetting our people based on religion, we ignore the pain point and give our enemies a narrative win.\n\n## 2. Strategic Framing &gt; Shouting\n\nAfter 9/11, the U.S. didn\u2019t say it would destroy the Middle East. Even as it toppled regimes and bombed nations, it claimed to bring \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201csecurity,\u201d and \u201cjustice.\u201d Barack Obama, Nobel Peace Prize winner, oversaw drone strikes across Pakistan, Yemen, and Afghanistan. But his image? Impeccable. Because the narrative was intact.\n\nMeanwhile, what do many Indians do?\n\nCall for nuclear war.\n\nGeneralize every Pakistani as a terrorist.\n\nSpread rage-bait and doctored clips.\n\nTurn every tragedy into a screeching match.\n\n\nThis is not patriotism. It\u2019s narrative suicide. You\u2019re not intimidating your enemy, you\u2019re arming them with your own foolishness. You don\u2019t even need their propaganda wings. You become your own worst press.\n\nFall fledged war in the modern world especially with those with almost similar nuclear warheads is not possible until and unless we are ready to lose a large chunk of our people which in return will surely destroy Pakistan but will also push us against the world for years and almost stall all of our development.\nPakistan had it's weaknesses like Water, so it went and signed Indus Water treaty with us, in return of which, we got almost nothing but just chains which bounded us with international law.\nNow, Pakistan didn't have to show goodwill to get water, it knew we are obliged to give it water.\nIf you surely to give something to someone, why do you expect them to be good to you? They'll just take it for granted.\nOur goodwill and coordination gave us wars and terrorist attacks.\nSo, we can strike Pakistan there or force it into changing terms of the treaty sometime later and have more free will based leverage than than being bounded by a treaty.\nComing to the 90s Pakistan realised that it cannot win a direct war with India, so it followed the bleed India with 1000 cuts strategy i.e. from internal divisions to terrorist attacks.\nAnd that is the reality of the current stae of the affairs.\nAlthough what troubles is the lack of understanding of Pakistan's leadership by Indians because \n1. We cannot go into a direct war with them without collateral damage.\n2. Leaves us with only the options of sanctions or boycott.\n3. When we boycott Pakistan or it's actors, we are effectively taking the same stand many nations took against Russia i.e. we are trying to slow down it's development, limit it's growth so that it doesn't become greater threat or we are trying to create unrest among it's common people against it's military and leadership, that could bring changes in the nation but the general idea, is limiting the strength of a rogue nation with nuclear weapons.\n4. But some Indians,  who lack understanding of strategy think, that our actions are spreading hatred against Pakistan. They say, why spread hatred against whole nation because of the actions of a few.\n5. Well because, for taking direct actions against those few, who are mostly guided by the top rung leaders in Pakistan, we will have to go to a war and the war will not involve their top rung leaders as first line of the defence but millions of common people.\n6. Now, unless you have better options without collateral damage of our people, just shut it up.   \n\n\n## 3. Narrative Building Isn\u2019t Optional. It\u2019s National Security.\n\nIndia has suffered cultural erasure for centuries, whether it\u2019s Turkic invasions, colonial plunder, or Islamist conversions. Historian Will Durant called the Islamic conquest of India \u201cthe bloodiest story in history.\u201d Yet how often do we narrate this truth with dignity?\nOur responses veer between silence and hysteria.\n\nRemember: geopolitics isn\u2019t a friendship contest. Nations support us because of markets, not morals. We are usefulz, until we\u2019re not. That\u2019s why narrative control is strategic, not sentimental. USA didn't care about terrorist attacks until it was attacked. Russia doesn't care about our nation and neither does the Israel nor the Palestine.\nEven those who may act like friends, care only because we have huge market and are of potential use in their growth story.\n\nSo, don't get involved in each and every conflict around the world online, even as citizens. Focus on your life and your nation.\nLearn from the official stands of this government and previous government on issues like the Israel vs Palestine with stances \" We stand with peace.\" This way you don't hurt any side and maintain an advantageous situation wherever you go.\nSometimes, acting ignorant could be bliss rather than making others hate you because you don't think what they think.\n\n## A. Stop Looking Foolish Online\n\nNo, you\u2019re not \u201cflexing nationalism\u201d by posting memes of mushroom clouds. Unless you're in uniform or the War Room, don\u2019t talk like a general.\n\nDon\u2019t threaten civilians online.\n\nDon\u2019t wish war from the comfort of WiFi.\n\nDon\u2019t react to death with cringe edits and hate slogans.\n\n\nNarrative warriors don\u2019t scream. They frame.\n\n## B. Frame With Purpose\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cThey must all die.\u201d\n\nSay: \u201cWe condemn this terrorist act targeting civilians based on religion. We seek justice through precise action.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t generalize people, critique ideologies and policies. Invoke history: show Kashmir\u2019s temples, destroyed shrines, and the cultural continuity that links today\u2019s Indians to that land.\n\nUse words that convey trauma, not tantrum.\n\n## C. Showcase Victimhood With Dignity\n\nTell real stories. Share displaced families\u2019 accounts.\n\nCreate short films, reels, podcasts, blogs.\n\nUse visual storytelling\u2014photos, timelines, symbols.\n\n\nTake lessons from #AllEyesOnRafah, a masterclass in digital empathy. Meanwhile, what do we do? Slap together a low-effort copy-paste with zero context.\n\nWhy not original, targeted, evidence-backed content?\n\nCite historical texts. Quote invaders\u2019 pride in plunder. Use their own words to reveal their crimes. That\u2019s how you win sympathy and respect.\n\n## D. Build Strength Where It Counts\n\nHate online? Channel it offline.\n\nJoin DRDO, ISRO, or serve.\n\nStart defence and chip-tech ventures.\n\n\nMock stupidity irrespective of party lines like we did during the launch of deepseek by China.\nEconomic power will help up secure far more strength.\n\n\n\n## E. Nationalism Must Be Strategic\n\nIndia isn\u2019t culturally homogeneous like Japan or China. But we need strategic alignment is a common value base.\n\nTrue nationalism isn\u2019t supremacist\u2014it\u2019s utilitarian. It\u2019s about extracting the best deals, securing resources, and elevating every citizen.\n\nRemember, nationalism is not your favorite leader\u2019s tweet. It\u2019s uniting 1.4 billion people under a shared vision, even when they disagree.\n\nIndia\u2019s unity is power. Fragmentation would turn us into a Middle East without oil.\n\n## F. Common People Must Create Strategic Consensus\n\nParties will change. Bureaucracies, courts, and global narratives remain. So stop thinking in 5-year cycles. Think long.\n\nBuild think tanks, fund journalists, mentor influencers.\n\nEnter academia, policymaking, and lawfare.\n\nCreate narrative ecosystems that outlive politics.\n\n\nRemember 26/11: terrorists wore Majority religion's symbols. They weren\u2019t just killing\u2014they were storytelling. They were prepared even for narrative war that followed. Thankfully, one was caught alive.\n\nAnd yet some Indian politicians still tried to spin it as \u201cMajority terror.\u201d Whose side were they on?\n\nWhen your own house is confused, the world shrugs.\n\nWe must build bipartisan consensus on at least five things: \n\u2022 National security.   \n\u2022 Education.    \n\u2022 Global media strategy.    \n\u2022 Economic resilience.   \n\u2022 Diplomatic clarity.     \n\n\nChina made \u201cnever again\u201d after the century of humiliation a national obsession. What\u2019s ours?\nWhat is it that we wish to achieve?\nWhat is that we agree on as common goal irrespective of whichever party rules us?\n\n\nWe Must Control the Narrative or Be Controlled\n\nAfter 1993, 2001, 2008, and the Pahalgam 2025, India still gets little sympathy. Why?\n\nBecause we react. We do not frame.\n\nLook at Al Jazeera, NYT, or even BBC; they shape the global lens. What do we do? Translate English, copy templates, and start hashtags after 12 hours of delay.\nWe are the largest English-speaking democracy and yet we lack world-class global media houses that are popular around the globe.\n\nThat\u2019s not a coincidence. That\u2019s a failure of vision.\n\n\nSo no, you\u2019re not fighting on the LoC. But you\u2019re part of the perception battlefield. If we don\u2019t seize the narrative, someone else will. Likely the ones who bomb us.\n\nDon\u2019t just react.

I also want to be able to save prompts and configurations across them both, so I don't have to manage two instances.
