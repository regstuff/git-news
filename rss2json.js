Iron*\n\n&gt;*Iron deficiency is a well-known contributor to RLS. Low iron levels can disrupt dopamine production, which is crucial for muscle movement regulation. It's advisable to check your ferritin levels with your GP before starting supplementation. (*[*Health*](\n\n&gt;*2. Magnesium*\n\n&gt;*Magnesium plays a vital role in nerve and muscle function. Studies have shown that magnesium supplementation can reduce the severity of RLS symptoms and improve sleep quality. (*[*PMC*](\n\n&gt;*3. Vitamin B6*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin B6 supports neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine. Supplementation has been associated with alleviation of RLS symptoms. (*[*Real Simple*]( [*Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements*](\n\n&gt;*4. Vitamin B12*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve health. Deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms, including those resembling RLS. (*[*Health*]( [*Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements*](\n\n&gt;*5. Folate (Vitamin B9)*\n\n&gt;*Folate deficiency has been linked to RLS, particularly in pregnant women. Ensuring adequate levels may help manage symptoms. (*[*Wikipedia*](\n\n&gt;*6. Vitamin D*\n\n&gt;*Vitamin D deficiency is common in individuals with RLS. Supplementation may alleviate symptoms, especially in those with confirmed low levels. (*[*Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements*]( [*Healthline*](\n\n&gt;*7. Vitamins C &amp; E*\n\n&gt;*These antioxidants may help reduce oxidative stress, which is thought to play a role in RLS. Supplementation has shown benefits in certain populations.*\n\n&gt;*8. Potassium*\n\n&gt;*While not directly linked to RLS, potassium is essential for muscle function.

To date, I\u2019ve received zero responses from institutions.\n\nThe only people who have responded are dealers offering thousands of dollars \u2014 and individuals claiming to be curators or experts, but offering no verifiable credentials.

Returning cultural heritage shouldn\u2019t be this difficult. Selling it shouldn\u2019t be easier than donating it.\n\nI don\u2019t want recognition or compensation.

I\u2019ve done everything the right way \u2014 not selling it, not hiding it, not seeking attention \u2014 just trying to give this back. But the silence, the closed doors, the fear of even having a conversation, have left me with nowhere to go. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard to do the right thing.

Tool is always called without argument resulting in errors (it works great with default function call, that error only occurs with native call).\n\nDo you have an idea of what could be the issue and how to fix it? I precise that I would like to use native call instead of default since performances seems better and it would reduce the context window as well (which is important for me because context length is limited to 2048 in my case to keep as much as possible VRAM for concurrency). Finally, I use the Hermes tool parsing on Vllm side.\n\nNote: if needed I can provide more informations relatives to my configuration.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1kv0oty/qwen34b_serve_with_vllm_native_tool_call_issue/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh: first trial begins for Hasina-era police officials", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3311743/bangladesh-first-trial-begins-hasina-era-officials-police", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Pakistan Waters Tensions: Islamabad struggles as Delhi suspends Indus Waters Treaty", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-05-25/VHJhbnNjcmlwdDg0NTgz/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China fast-tracks stealth jets to Pakistan to counter India: Report", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/china-fast-tracks-stealth-jets-pakistan-counter-india-report-2076400", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India\u2019s Global PR Blitz Over \u2018Operation Sindoor\u2019 Draws Mockery from Chinese Netizens", "summary": "", "link": "https://chinaglobalsouth.com/2025/05/25/india-pr-campaign-pakistan-global-times-reaction/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India registers 3-fold growth in renewable energy capacity to 232GW in last decade", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/energy/india-registers-3-fold-growth-in-renewable-energy-capacity-to-232gw-in-last-decade-19610130.htm", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
