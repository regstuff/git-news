But elsewhere along the front, Russia is slicing its way through Ukrainian defences. In Kupiansk in the north, its troops have cut Ukrainian formations in two at the Oskil river. In Chasiv Yar in the east, they have crossed the main Siverskyi Donets canal, after six months of trying. Farther south, Russian troops have taken high ground in and around [Vuhledar]( (pictured), and are moving in on Kurakhove from two directions. In Kursk, inside Russia, Ukraine has lost around half the territory it seized earlier this year.\n\nThe problem is not so much the loss of territory, which is limited and has come at enormous cost to Russia\u2014600,000 dead and wounded since the start of the war, on American estimates, and 57,000 dead in this year to October alone, according to Ukrainian intelligence\u2014as the steady erosion in the size and quality of Ukraine\u2019s forces. Ukrainian units are understrength and overstretched, worn thin by heavy casualties. Despite a [new mobilisation law]( that took effect in May, the army, outside a handful of brigades, has struggled to recruit enough replacements, with young men reluctant to sign up to tours of duty that are at best indefinite and, at worst, one-way missions. Western partners are privately urging Ukraine\u2019s leaders to lower the mobilisation age floor from 25 to increase the potential pool of recruits. But political sensitivities and fears over an already alarming demographic crisis stand in the way of any change.\n\nIn a recent essay, Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London, identifies several reasons for Ukraine\u2019s declining fortunes. One is a shortfall in its air-defence interceptors, allowing Russian reconnaissance drones to establish what he calls \u201ccontinuous and dense surveillance\u201d. These in turn cue up ballistic-missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian artillery in the rear and glide bombs against troops at the front, allowing Russia to make slow but steady advances in small units, often using motorcycles because tanks are too easy to spot. Ukraine\u2019s limited stock of shells\u2014Russia currently has a two-to-one advantage in shellfire, according to Ivan Havrilyuk, Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister\u2014as well as tanks and armoured vehicles compounds that problem. The less firepower and armour are available, the greater the reliance on infantry and the greater the casualties.\n\nRussia is not without its own [serious problems]( Next year it will spend a third of its national budget on defence, starving the civilian economy in the process. Inflation is perhaps double the official annual rate of more than 8%. In 2025 ordinary Russian families will begin to feel the economic pain for the first time, says a European intelligence official, adding that there are early signs of war fatigue among those closely connected to the conflict, such as mothers and family members.\n\nOn the battlefield, Russia remains reliant on crude tactics that result in massive casualties. The decision to borrow thousands of North Korean troops, who are thought to be bound for the Kursk front, shows that Russian units are also stretched. Russia\u2019s general staff and defence ministry have put \u201cheavy pressure\u201d on the Kremlin to mobilise more men, says the European official. \u201cRussia now doesn\u2019t have sufficient forces to mass,\u201d says a senior nato official. \u201cIf they achieved a breakthrough they could not exploit it.\u201d There is little short-term risk of Russian troops streaming west to Dnipro or Odessa.\n\nBut the crisis in Russia\u2019s [war economy]( is likely to play out over a longer period. Russia\u2019s defence industry is in part dependent on the refurbishment of Soviet-era stocks, which are getting low in critical areas such as armoured vehicles. It is nonetheless far outperforming Western production lines. The European Union claims to be making more than 1m shells per year; Russia is making three times that, and is also boosted by supplies from North Korea and Iran. \u201cI just don\u2019t know we can produce enough, give enough,\u201d says a person familiar with the flow of American aid, though a recent $800m commitment to boost Ukraine\u2019s indigenous drone production is welcome. \u201cWe have no more to give them without taking serious risks in other places.\u201d On manpower, too, Russia remains solvent. Its army is recruiting around 30,000 men per month, says the nato official. That is not enough to meet internal targets, says another official, but it is adequate to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months.\n\nRussia cannot fight for ever. But the worry among America, European and Ukrainian officials is that, on current trends, Ukraine\u2019s breaking point will come first. \u201cMoscow seems to be wagering that it can achieve its objectives in the Donbas next year,\u201d writes Mr Watling, \u201cand impose a rate of casualties and material degradation on the Ukrainian military high enough that it will no longer be capable of preventing further advances.\u201d That, he warns, would give Russia leverage in any negotiations that follow.\n\nThe gloomy mood is evident in a shift in America\u2019s language. Senior officials like Mr Austin still strike a confident note, promising that Ukraine will win. Those involved in the guts of planning in the Pentagon say that, in practice, the ambitions of early 2023\u2014a Ukrainian force that could take back its territory or shock Russia into talks through a well-crafted armoured punch\u2014have given way to a narrow focus on preventing defeat. \u201cAt this point we are thinking more and more about how Ukraine can survive,\u201d says a person involved in that planning. Others put it more delicately. \u201cThe next several months\u201d, noted Jim O\u2019Brien, the State Department\u2019s top Europe official, at a conference in Riga on October 19th, \u201care an opportunity for us to reaffirm that Ukraine can stay on the battlefield for the next couple of years.\u201d", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1gfj7pl/ukraine_is_now_struggling_to_survive_not_to_win/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anna Kendrick Donated All the Money She Made From \u2018Woman of the Hour\u2019 to Victims of Assault", "summary": "Excerpt:\n\n\u201cOnce I realized, \u2018Oh there\u2019s going to be money exchanging hands,\u2019 I asked myself the question, \u2018Do you feel gross about this?'\u201d Kendrick explained to the hosts. \u201cAnd I did.
