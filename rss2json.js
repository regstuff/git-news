Today's vibe coding only existed for 5 minutes.\n\nBut what I'm talking about is the 'moral equivalent'. Most people going into vibe coding the problem isn't that they don't know how to code.\n\nYesterday's 'idea' founders didn't know how to code either... they just raised funding, got a team together, and bombarded them with 'prompts' for their 'vision'.\n\nJust like today's vibe coders they didn't think about things like 'is this actually the right solution' or 'shouldn't we take a week to just think instead of just hacking'.\n\nIt was just task after task 'vibe coded' out to their new team burning through tons of VC money while they hoped to blow up.\n\nDon't fall into that trap if you start building something with AI as your vibe coder instead of VC money and a bunch of folks who believe in your vision but are utterly confused for half their workday what on earth you actually want.\n\nGo slower - think everything through.\n\nThere's a reason UX designers exist. There's a reason senior developers at big companies often take a week to just think and read existing code before they start shipping features after they move to a new team.\n\nSometimes your idea is great but your solution for 'how to do it' isn't... being open to that will help you use AI better. Ask it 'what's bad about this approach?'. Especially smarter models. 'What haven't I thought of?'. Ask Deep Research tools 'what's been done before in this space, give me a full report into the wins and losses'.\n\nDo all that stuff before you jump into Cursor and just start vibing out your mission statement.

Sharing them here in case it helps someone else get more out of it:\n\n**1. Case Study Generator**  \nPrompt it like this:  \n*I am interested in\u00a0\\[specify the area of interest or skill you want to develop\\]\u00a0and its application in the business world. Can you provide a selection of case studies from different companies where this knowledge has been applied successfully? These case studies should include a brief overview, the challenges faced, the solutions implemented, and the outcomes achieved. This will help me understand how these concepts work in practice, offering new ideas and insights that I can consider applying to my own business.*\n\nReplace \\[area of interest\\] with whatever you\u2019re researching (e.g., \u201cuser onboarding\u201d or \u201csupply chain optimization\u201d). It\u2019ll pull together real-world examples and break down what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what lessons were learned. Super helpful for getting practical insight instead of just theory.\n\n**2. The Clarifying Questions Trick**  \nBefore ChatGPT starts working on anything, tell it:  \n*\u201cBut first ask me clarifying questions that will help you complete your task.\u201d*\n\nIt forces ChatGPT to slow down and get more context from you, which usually leads to way better, more tailored results. Works great if you find its first draft replies too vague or off-target.\n\n**3. Negative Prompting (use with caution)**  \nYou can tell it stuff like:  \n*\"Do not talk about\u00a0\\[topic\\]\" or \"#Never mention:\u00a0\\[specific term\\]\" (e.g., \"#Never mention: Julius Caesar\").*\n\nIt *can* help avoid certain topics or terms if needed, but it\u2019s also risky. Because once you mention something\u2014even to avoid it. It stays in the context window. The model might still bring it up or get weirdly vague. I\u2019d say only use this if you\u2019re confident in what you're doing. Positive prompting (\u201cfocus on X\u201d instead of \u201cdon\u2019t mention Y\u201d) usually works better.\n\n**4. Template Transformer**  \nLet\u2019s say ChatGPT gives you a cool structured output, like a content calendar or a detailed checklist. You can just say:  \n*\"Transform this into a re-usable template.\"*\n\nIt\u2019ll replace specific info with placeholders so you can re-use the same structure later with different inputs. Helpful if you want to standardize your workflows or build prompt libraries for different use cases.\n\n**5. Prompt Fixer by TeachMeToPrompt (free tool)**  \nThis one's simple, but kinda magic. Paste in any prompt and any language, and [TeachMeToPrompt]( rewrites it to make it clearer, sharper, and way more likely to get the result you want from ChatGPT. It keeps your intent but tightens the wording so the AI actually understands what you\u2019re trying to do. Super handy if your prompts aren\u2019t hitting, or if you just want to save time guessing what works.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kptzqt/5_chatgpt_prompts_most_people_dont_know_but_should/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Top Lashkar terrorist behind 3 big attacks in India killed in Pakistan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/saifullah-khalid-lashkar-terrorist-big-attacks-in-india-killed-in-pakistan-sindh-province-2726649-2025-05-18", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What\u2019s the one dumb idea you still regret not building?", "summary": "In 2021 I had a completely useless idea: a browser extension that replaces all corporate buzzwords with passive-aggressive honesty.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s circle back\u201d \u2192 \u201cWe\u2019re never talking about this again.\u201d\n\u201cQuick sync\u201d \u2192 \u201cUnpaid emotional labor.\u201d\n\n100% for my own amusement.
