Ukrainian energy minister Denys Shmyhal has hailed the move as vital to help his country handle a winter heating crisis caused by Russia\u2019s attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shmyhal announced that the two countries\u2019 gas transmission operators had agreed a phased increase in capacity for importing gas from Poland to Ukraine. Between the start of February and end of April, capacity will rise from 15.3 million to 18.4 million cubic metres a day.\n\n\u201cThis is an important agreement to ensure a stable heat supply to Ukrainian homes, hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure,\u201d said Shmyhal. \u201cWe thank our Polish partners for their consistent support of Ukraine and joint work on strengthening our energy sustainability.\u201d\n\nUkrainians have been struggling to stay warm this winter as Russian attacks have taken out energy infrastructure and temperatures have regularly dropped below -15\u00b0C.\n\nEarlier this month, the authorities reported that almost 60% of buildings in Kyiv have no electricity and a similar proportion lack heating. President Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Russia of deliberately targeting energy infrastructure to make civilians suffer.\n\nIn addition to increasing gas export capacity, Poland has\u00a0[also sent hundreds of electricity generators](\u00a0from the government\u2019s strategic reserves to Ukraine.\n\nPoland\u2019s gas transmission system operator, Gaz-System, had already\u00a0[announced](\u00a0last week that it would increase capacity for exports to Ukraine from February thanks to the modernisation of the metering station in Hermanowice on the Polish-Ukrainian border.\n\nLast year, Polish state energy giant Orlen\u00a0[signed an agreement](\u00a0to supply Ukraine with gas. The Polish government\u00a0also\u00a0[outlined its aim](\u00a0for Poland to become a hub for increased exports of gas that it receives as liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States.\n\nIn his comments on Wednesday, Shmyhal noted that Poland is now a \u201ckey route\u201d for Ukraine\u2019s gas supplies. \u201cIn 2025, 2.1 billion cubic meters of gas were delivered through Poland \u2013 more than 30% of the total import volume, including about 600 million cubic meters of American LNG.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday this week, Polish energy minister\u00a0Mi\u0142osz Motyka said that the EU\u2019s plans to phase out all imports of Russian gas by 2027 offer a further opportunity to \u201cbuild Poland\u2019s strategic position in the region\u201d.\n\n\u201cThanks to our partnership with the United States, we can become Northern Europe\u2019s gateway to secure gas supplies from other sources,\u201d said Motyka. \u201cCountries in our region, including Ukraine, can benefit from this.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Poland opened a new gas interconnector with Slovakia that was supposed to play a role in helping its southern neighbour diversify away from Russian gas.

Some of the material taken from his device was then leaked to and published by state broadcaster TVP, which was at the time a mouthpiece for the PiS government.\n\nWhen asked about that issue by the parliamentary Pegasus inquiry, Kaczy\u0144ski said that the purpose of surveilling Brejza had been to \u201cshow the public that a prominent opposition politician is committing very serious and abhorrent crimes\u201d, reports the\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*.\n\nHowever, Brejza has never been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crimes. He therefore filed a case against the PiS leader under article 212 of Poland\u2019s criminal code, which makes defamation a crime punishable by up to one year in prison.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Warsaw-\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie district court announced that it had discontinued the case against Kaczy\u0144ski, finding that, despite his words constituting defamation, they were \u201cnot socially harmful to an extent that exceeds the limits\u00a0of criminal liability\u201d.\n\nKaczy\u0144ski \u201cwas aware that Mr\u00a0Brejza had never been convicted or\u00a0charged\u201d, said judge Tomasz Tr\u0119bicki, quoted by the\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*\u00a0daily. \u201cHe should not have publicly claimed that Mr Brejza had committed a crime.\u201d\n\nHowever, the judge noted that, for someone to be convicted of a crime, it must be shown that their actions were socially harmful. That bar was not met in this case.\n\nTr\u0119bicki also argued that Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s comments should be understood in context: they were \u201cnot a standalone thesis\u201d presented by him, \u201cbut a statement constructed in response to a question\u201d presented during an inquiry hearing.\n\nAfterwards, Brejza\u2019s lawyer,\u00a0Dorota Brejza, who is also his wife, called the judge\u2019s ruling \u201ccompletely incomprehensible on a human level\u201d and confirmed that they would appeal. \u201cYou cannot \\[be allowed to\\] disinform, lie or inject venom into the public space.\u201d\n\nKrzysztof Brejza, meanwhile, told broadcaster TVN that \u201cwords are one step ahead of actions\u201d, and pointed to the example of former party colleague Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, the mayor of Gda\u0144sk, who was\u00a0[murdered](\u00a0after he had been regularly accused by certain politicians and media outlets of crimes.\n\nKaczy\u0144ski and his legal representatives have not yet commented on the ruling. On Wednesday, PiS spokesman Rafa\u0142 Bochenek confirmed media reports that Kaczy\u0144ski is currently in hospital receiving treatment for an unspecified infection.\n\nAfter PiS was removed from power in December 2023, the new government, a coalition led by KO, launched a number of investigations into the use of Pegasus by the former administration.\n\nIn 2024, it revealed that around\u00a0[600 people were targeted for surveillance using Pegasus]( including some\u00a0[political opponents of PiS]( Last year, KO leader and Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u00a0[revealed](\u00a0that his wife and daughter had been among those caught up in the surveillance.\n\nMeanwhile, in December 2023, a court\u00a0[ordered TVP to apologise to Brejza](\u00a0and pay him 200,000 zloty in compensation for publishing private messages taken from his phone using Pegasus.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/28/court-rules-kaczynskis-defamation-of-political-opponent-during-pegasus-inquiry-not-socially-harmful/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan army says two-year RSF siege of key town broken", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/27/sudan-army-says-nearly-two-year-rsf-siege-of-key-town-broken", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
