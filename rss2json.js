I am tasked with developing a solution to\n\n1. Identify all the definitions (defined in Section 1) which are not referred to in the document (Problem 1)\n2. Identify all the phrases/terms in the document, which are not defined in the definitions (Problem 2)\n\n# ## Simplified goals\n\nFor both problems, I need to identify all the definitions and all the terms and compare them to one another. There are signals to identify them\n\n* Definitions: they are capitalised, bolded, double-quoted and only located in Section 1\n* Phrases/Terms: they are capitalised in the document. They can be double-quoted in other sections apart from Section 1.\n\n# ## Challenges\n\nIdentifying definitions is not very difficult as I segregate the document to only Section 1 and use a regular expression to extract the definitions. However, identifying phrases/terms (let's call them expected phrases) is difficult since there are other capitalised words in the document\n\n1. Words are capitalised at the beginning of a sentence\n2. Some common names (for instance, geographical areas, regions, countries, human names, etc.) are capitalised.\n3. When two phrases are together, how do we know if we should split them or consider them as a single phrase?\n\nAnother challenge is that we do accept a phrase with a non-capitalised word (generally a preposition), sandwiched between two capitalised words (Eg: Events of Proceedings should be considered as a phrase)\n\n# ## Approaches\n\nI've been trying different approaches but it hasn't given me much success\n\n1. LLMs: give the document to an LLMs (here I chose llama3 since the document is quite confidential, we prefer something like llama.cpp instead of a commercial LLMs like chatGPT) and the output is very poor\n2. NLP: named-entity recognition approach to identify the phrases but they tend to miss a lot of phrases\n3. Regular expressions: to my surprise, regular expressions work the best. First of all, it works to identify all the definitions. In terms of expected phrases, it is a combination of different regular expressions and word filtering and stem-changing (i.e. plural to singular). It's better than NLP and LLMs for now (though its solution is not completely optimised. There are still a lot of expected phrases that it can find that need filtering). It requires a lot of effort of filtering and I am afraid that it might not work for other documents.\n\nAny suggestions from anyone would be much appreciated.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1devh5e/finding_unused_definitions_in_a_legal_document/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Solar panel prices have fallen by around 20% every time global capacity doubled", "summary": "", "link": "https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/solar-panel-prices-have-fallen-by-around-20-every-time-global-capacity-doubled", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Custom modification on transformers", "summary": "Are there any resources in huggingface on adding or removing layers in a already build model like bert or roberta.\n\nI want to replace some layers in a transformer model for my project. like changing the attention layer for example.\n\ni also want to add my own layer inside the transformer as well.\n\nThank you.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1deu209/custom_modification_on_transformers/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Modi to visit Italy on June 13 for G7 Summit, hold talks with Meloni in first foreign visit of third term", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/india/pm-modi-to-leave-for-g7-summit-in-italy-on-june-13-hold-bilateral-talks-with-giorgia-meloni-13781774.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The man who escaped the scam rings of Cambodia", "summary": "", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/mid-career/the-man-who-escaped-the-scam-rings-of-cambodia/articleshow/110626511.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'My 50-year puzzle of the East Lothian hill where ancient fires burned'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.scotsman.com/heritage-and-retro/heritage/my-50-year-puzzle-of-the-east-lothian-hill-where-ancient-fires-burned-4661928", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Federal court permanently blocks Florida's law against trans health care", "summary": "Hinkle also stated, \"Gender Identity is real.\"", "link": "https://www.advocate.com/news/florida-trans-care-ban-blocked", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Edgar Atheling, the Lost King of England Who Was Born in Hungary and Joined the First Crusade", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1devxdj/edgar_atheling_the_lost_king_of_england_who_was/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "2 Indians, in Russian army, killed in Ukraine war; Govt demands \u2018verified stop\u2019 to recruitment of its nationals", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/india/two-indians-recruited-by-russian-army-killed-in-russia-ukraine-war-13781489.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UAE Foreign Minister HH Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddea congratulates Dr Jaishankar \n Dr SJaishankar on his reappointment as India\u2019s EAM.", "summary": "# UAE Foreign Minister HH Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed's congratulatory message to Dr. S.
