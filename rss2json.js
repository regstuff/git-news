The ultimate goal is to identify keywords used in our translation database from different types of input text.\n\nThe input data can contain both free text and lists.  For example:\n\n1. Free-text descriptions, such as \"AUDI A7 SPORTBACK 50 TFSI e Quattro Black Ed 5dr S Tronic \\[ Tech \\]\"\n2. Equipment/feature lists, such as \"360 degree parking camera, Audi connect safety and service (e-call), Audi connect with Amazon Alexa Integration, Audi drive select, Audi smartphone interface includes wireless Apple carplay/Android Auto\"\n\nAdditionally, the input may contain names and addresses that should be ignored.\n\nBased on the reading and research I have done so far, I'm proposing the following pipeline to build an initial proof of concept:\n\n1. Use a large language model to separate the input into vehicle descriptions and equipment lists, and identify the language.\n2. Train a model (probably a spacy ner model) specifically for understanding and extracting information from the vehicle descriptions, such as make model and variant.\n3.
