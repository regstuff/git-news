QUANTUM PHYSICS  \nInitial state: |\u03c8\u27e9 = (3|0\u27e9 + 4i|1\u27e9)/5  \n\u2192 The probability of getting |1\u27e9 is |4i/5|\u00b2 = (16/25) = **64%**  \n\u2192 After the measurement, the system collapses into the state **|1\u27e9**\n\n2. NUMBER THEORY  \nSuppose there exist positive integers x, y, z such that x\u2074 + y\u2074 = z\u2074.  \n\u2192 Then (x\u00b2)\u00b2 + (y\u00b2)\u00b2 = (z\u00b2)\u00b2  \n\u2192 It is a sum of two squares that gives a perfect square.  \nBut Fermat proved that **x\u2074 + y\u2074 \u2260 z\u2074** has no positive integer solutions,  \nusing **infinite descent**: each solution would produce a smaller one, leading to contradiction.  \n\u2192 **Conclusion**: **No positive integer solution exists.**\n\n3. ANALYTICAL PHILOSOPHY  \nGettier shows that the triple **JTB (Justified True Belief)** is not sufficient for knowledge,  \nbecause one can have a true and justified belief **for wrong or accidental reasons**.  \n\u2192 In this case, Smith has a true belief due to a **coincidence**.  \n\u2192 Proposed solution: Add a condition like **\u201cno essential falsehood in the justification\u201d**  \nor a notion of **\u201ccausal traceability\u201d or \u201creliabilism\u201d**.  \n\n4. MOLECULAR BIOCHEMISTRY  \nThe enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is **aldolase**.  \n\u2192 Produces: **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)** and **dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)**.  \n\u2192 Only G3P enters glycolysis directly; DHAP is converted to G3P \u200b\u200bvia **triose phosphate isomerase**  \nbecause **only G3P is the substrate of the next step of glycolysis.**\n\n5. THEORY OF COMPUTATION  \nSuppose HALT(M, w) is decidable (i.e. there exists H which tells whether M stops on input w).  \n\u2192 I build a machine D that does: \u201cif H(M, M) says that M stops on itself, then it enters a loop;  \notherwise, it stops.\u201d  \n\u2192 Now we execute D(D):  \n\u2192 If D(D) stops \u2192 then H said that D(D) does not stop \u2192 Contradiction  \n\u2192 If D(D) does not stop \u2192 then H said that D(D) stops \u2192 Contradiction  \n\u2192 **Conclusion**: HALT cannot be decidable \u2192 **Undecidability demonstrated via diagonalization.**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1op7an0/deductive_behavior_in_statistical_models/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Zealand wildlife park to euthanize 7 lions, citing financial troubles: \"No real options left\"", "summary": "", "link": "https://www-cbsnews-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/lions-euthanized-kamo-wildlife-sanctuary-new-zealand/?amp_js_v=0.1&amp;amp_gsa=1#webview=1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "PHYS.Org: \"2.75-million-year-old stone tools may mark a turning point in human evolution\"", "summary": "**See also:** [The study, which was conducted within Turkana Basin, as published in *Nature Communications*](", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2025-11-million-year-stone-tools-human.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Multiple Workflows with ComfyUI?", "summary": "Is there a tool that supports multiple comfyUI workflows?
