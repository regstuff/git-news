(TL;DR at the bottom)\n\nI am quite new here since I stumbled upon the subreddit by chance while looking up information about a specific master's program.\n\nI recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in (theoretical) Linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, sociolinguistics etc.) and I loved my major (graduated with almost a 3.9 GPA) but didn't want to rush into a master's program blindly without deciding what I would like to REALLY focus on or specialize in. I could always see myself continuing with theoretical linguistics stuff and eventually going down the 'academia' route; but realizing the network, time and luck one would need to have to secure a position in academia made me have doubts. I honestly can't stand the thought of having a PhD in linguistics just because I am passionate about the field, only to end up unemployed at the age of 30+, so I decided to venture into a different branch.\n\nI have to be honest, I am not the most well-versed person out there when it comes to CL or NLP but I took a course focusing on computational methods in linguistics around a year ago, which fascinated me. Throughout the course, we looked at regex, text processing, n-gram language models, finite state automata etc. but besides the little bit of Python I learned for that course, I barely have any programming knowledge/experience (I also took a course focusing on data analysis with R but not sure how much that helps).\n\nI am not pursuing any degree as of now, you can consider it to be something similar to a gap year and since I want to look into CL/NLP/LT-specific programs, I think I can use my free time to gain some programming knowledge by the time the application periods start, I have at least 6-8 months after all.\n\nI want to apply to master's programs for the upcoming academic year (2025/2026) and I have already started researching. However, not long after I started, I realized that there were quite a few programs available and they all had different names, different program content and approaches to the area of LT(?). I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of options; so, I wanted to make this post to get some advice.\n\nI would love to hear your advice/suggestions if anyone here has completed, is still doing or has knowledge about any CL/NLP/LT master's program that would be suitable for someone with a solid foundation in theoretical linguistics but not so much in CS, coding or maths. **I am mainly interested in programs in Germany** (I have already looked into a few there such as Stuttgart, Potsdam, Heidelberg etc. but I don't know what I should look for when deciding which programs to apply to) but feel free to chime in if you have anything to say about any program in Europe. What are the most important things to look for when choosing programs to apply to? Which programs do you think would prepare a student the best, considering the 'fluctuating' nature of the industry?\n\nP.S.: I assume there are a lot of people from the US on the subreddit but I am not located anywhere near, so studying in the US isn't one of my options.\n\nTL;DR: **Which CL/NLP/LT master's programs in Europe would you recommend to someone with a strong background in Linguistics (preferably in Germany)?**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1gfrnux/clnlplt_masters_programs_in_europe/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MaskGCT: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Masked Generative Codec Transformer", "summary": "", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00750", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Flick : Watch TV shows / Movies with CLI or Rofi\n", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/9z9bjwwyd1yd1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "SAG-AFTRA and AI startup Ethovox have signed an agreement protecting actors' rights in AI voice models.", "summary": "", "link": "https://the-decoder.com/sag-aftra-and-ai-startup-ethovox-strike-deal-to-protect-actors-voices-in-synthetic-media/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Radiohead singer Thom Yorke walks off stage as fan shouts Gaza protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrv2zyd22o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UN General Assembly condemns the economic embargo of Cuba for a 32nd year | AP News", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/cuba-us-economic-embargo-united-nations-7eaaac3318080a7640c64fd424a8e668", "author": "None"}, {"title": "United Kingdom: Safe zones outside abortion clinics come into effect", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.sky.com/story/safe-zones-outside-abortion-clinics-come-into-effect-13245090", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologist parents ", "summary": "How do you deal with being away from your family so much?

I go back and forth between, \"I love archaeology\" and \"I don't want to be a barista during the off-season\".\n\nRecently, I have been looking into geology because I find the field interesting, but not to the same degree that I like archaeology (like a second choice in order to have enough money to survive). Somehow, I only recently came to the realization that I can become a geology archaeologist (geo-archaeologist?

Right now this is just an idea, but I am researching, contacting archaeologists and archaeological societies, and asking Reddit to see if my idea is feasible and has ever been done by anyone.\n\nAs I said, I am still researching this idea, but beyond this I am curious. What education do you think this would require? Would I be able to have multiple focuses and specialties in archaeology?

I am taking a year off after my first academic year at my university to figure out what I plan to major in and what field I go into.
