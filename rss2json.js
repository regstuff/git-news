I graduated with an undergrad degree in Spanish and Linguistics from Oxford Uni last year and I currently have an offer to study the Speech and Language Processing MSc at Edinburgh Uni. I have been working in Public Relations since I graduated but would really like to move into a more linguistics-oriented role.\n\nThe reason I am wondering whether to accept the Edinburgh offer or not is that I have basically no hands-on experience in computer science/data science/applied maths yet. I last studied maths at GCSE and specialised in Spanish Syntax on my uni course. My coding is still amateur, too. In my current company I could probably explore coding/data science a little over the coming year, but I don\u2019t enjoy working there very much.\n\nSo I can either accept Edinburgh now and take the leap into NLP, or take a year to learn some more about it, maybe find another job in in the meantime and apply to some other Masters programs next year (Applied linguistics at Cambridge seems cool, but as I understand more academic and less vocational than Edinburgh\u2019s course). Would the sudden jump into NLP be too much? (I could still try and brush up over summer) Or should I take a year out of uni? Another concern is that I am already 24, and don\u2019t want to leave the masters too late. Obviously no clear-cut answer here, but hoping someone with some experience can help me out with my decision - thanks in advance!\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1dm2xvr/nlp_masters_or_industry_experience/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jimmy Carter's 100-day countdown to 100 is tomorrow", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/22/jimmy-carter-100-birthday-celebration/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lockheed considers India unit amid 3-firm race to bag cargo aircraft deal", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockheed-considers-india-unit-amid-3-firm-race-to-bag-cargo-aircraft-deal-101718993760122.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Next JS AI SaaS dashboard template", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/soulbliss/next-js-ai-tool-layout-1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Open sourcing Nerve, a tool to instrument LLMs to perform tasks, without writing code.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/evilsocket/nerve", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Probe into 1985 Kanishka bombing remains 'active &amp; ongoing': Canadian police", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/canada-air-india-kanishka-bombing-1985-khalistan-investigation-rcmp-13785082.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Two Airbus A340 Jets Worth Hundreds of Millions \"Smuggled\" from Lithuania to Iran", "summary": "", "link": "https://defencesecurityasia.com/en/two-airbus-a340-jets-worth-hundreds-of-millions-smuggled-from-lithuania-to-iran/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Delhi should do correct math on direct flights between China, India: Global Times editorial", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202406/1314620.shtml", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Transformer models grok their way to implicit reasoning, but not all types are equal", "summary": "\ud83d\udc49 Researchers at Ohio State University and Carnegie Mellon University investigated whether transformer models can acquire the ability to make implicit inferences through grokking, specifically in composition and comparison tasks.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 The results show that the models acquire the ability to make implicit inferences in both types of tasks through prolonged training beyond the point of overfitting, but can only generalize to unseen examples in comparison tasks.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 The researchers attribute the difference to the internal structure of the learned circuits and recommend adjustments to the transformer architecture that make a qualitative difference in a first experiment.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1dlrpfv/transformer_models_grok_their_way_to_implicit/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "If you speed in Austria, the government can now confiscate your car and sell it", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/speeding-driving-austria-government-confiscate-sell-car-europe-2024-6", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The paradox of India\u2019s global rise, its regional decline", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-paradox-of-indias-global-rise-its-regional-decline/article68136618.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ChatGPT-written \"The Last Screenwriter\" sparks debate on the role of AI in the film industry", "summary": "1/ Swiss director Peter Luisi has made a movie called \"The Last Screenwriter\", the script for which he says was largely written by the AI ChatGPT.
