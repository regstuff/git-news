It's been a long time since I finetuned something, and it could come in handy in the field of my work.\n\nMy plan :  \n1. There are some available labelled dataset in the language of interest  \n2. In addition I'll probably try generating some dataset   \n\n\nPlease share your experience  with finetuning. How do you decide on the base model? What are the pitfalls, considerations and also tools/resources you found helpful?  \n\n\nThanks for sharing :)  \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1bsakys/ner_finetuning/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Somalia's Puntland withdraws recognition of federal govt, rejects presidency of Hassan Sheikh after constitutional changes.", "summary": "", "link": "https://hornobserver.com/articles/2691/Somalias-Puntland-withdraws-recognition-of-federal-govt-rejects-presidency-of-Hassan-Sheikh", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sadhanapada 2024", "summary": "I wish to connect with the sadhanapada applicants of this year  from India.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bsa3nj/sadhanapada_2024/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Study cautions against use of AI text detection tools in higher education", "summary": "\ud83d\udc49 A study by researchers from British University Vietnam and James Cook University Singapore shows that GenAI text detection tools have significant weaknesses, especially in detecting manipulated, AI-generated texts. The average accuracy dropped from 39.5% to 17.4% when the content was slightly altered.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 The evaluated tools showed large differences in both detection accuracy and susceptibility to false-positive results. While Copyleaks showed the highest accuracy, it also had the highest rate of falsely classifying human-written texts as AI-generated at 50%.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 Due to the accuracy limitations and the potential for false accusations, the research team advises against using these tools to uncover violations of academic integrity at this time. Instead, they recommend focusing on discussions about academic integrity, alternative assessment methods, and a positive use of GenAI tools to support learning.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1brk5i3/study_cautions_against_use_of_ai_text_detection/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spanish game abandoned after alleged racist slurs from crowd", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dw.com/en/spanish-game-abandoned-after-alleged-racist-slurs-from-crowd/a-68706259", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Government agents raid Peruvian President Boluarte's residence in luxury watch investigation ", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/peru-president-boluarte-luxury-watches-investigation-e39d68d3e04cf228c59bd6858306c520", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Burton Agnes Drum, an ornate solid chalk 5000 year old drum that was found interred in the grave of 2 children, East Yorkshire (England).", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bs8qe3", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - evoluteur/healing-frequencies: Play the healing frequencies of various sets of tuning forks: Solfeggio, Organs, Mineral nutrients, Ohm, Chakras, Cosmic octave, Otto, DNA nucleotides... or custom.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/evoluteur/healing-frequencies", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Isha Institute of Inner Sciences, Tennessee Celebrates Sadhguru's Recovery!", "summary": "", "link": "https://youtube.com/shorts/-AzGxwDNl1k", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Human Brains Have Gotten Astonishingly Bigger Over the Last 75 Years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a60311676/brain-bigger-dementia/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Ancient Egyptian board game of Hounds and Jackals (ca. 1814\u20131805 BCE, Middle Kingdom)", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/6ev8kkqf8jrc1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prominent Democratic Party of Korea politician Park Hong-geun says \u201canti-discrimination law goes against God\u2019s providence of creation\u201d", "summary": "Translation: Park Hong-geun, a candidate for Jungnang-eul district of the Democratic Party of Korea in Seoul, said, \"I am very concerned and worried because anti-discrimination law is contrary to God's providence of creation,\" showing his opposition of the inclusion of \"sexual orientation\" in the anti-discrimination law.\n\nWhen asked about his position on the anti-discrimination law, Park, who attended a debate hosted by the Jungnang district Parish Council in Seoul on the 30th, said, \"The Democratic Party and I made adjustments to prevent discussions of anti-discrimination law from proceeding radically when I was floor leader, and we will continue to manage it well.\"\n\nCandidate Park said, \"It is true that the equality provisions stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Korea should be applied without exception and should be practiced in each field,\" but added, \"It became more complicated when the issue of gender identity, which was not in the recommendation of the National Human Rights Commission, was specified, and caused concerns from the church.\"\n\nBro, literally this is \u2018liberal\u2019 of South Korea.
