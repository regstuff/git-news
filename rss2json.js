Sharing them here in case it helps someone else get more out of it:\n\n**1. Case Study Generator**  \nPrompt it like this:  \n*I am interested in\u00a0\\[specify the area of interest or skill you want to develop\\]\u00a0and its application in the business world. Can you provide a selection of case studies from different companies where this knowledge has been applied successfully? These case studies should include a brief overview, the challenges faced, the solutions implemented, and the outcomes achieved. This will help me understand how these concepts work in practice, offering new ideas and insights that I can consider applying to my own business.*\n\nReplace \\[area of interest\\] with whatever you\u2019re researching (e.g., \u201cuser onboarding\u201d or \u201csupply chain optimization\u201d). It\u2019ll pull together real-world examples and break down what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what lessons were learned. Super helpful for getting practical insight instead of just theory.\n\n**2. The Clarifying Questions Trick**  \nBefore ChatGPT starts working on anything, tell it:  \n*\u201cBut first ask me clarifying questions that will help you complete your task.\u201d*\n\nIt forces ChatGPT to slow down and get more context from you, which usually leads to way better, more tailored results. Works great if you find its first draft replies too vague or off-target.\n\n**3. Negative Prompting (use with caution)**  \nYou can tell it stuff like:  \n*\"Do not talk about\u00a0\\[topic\\]\" or \"#Never mention:\u00a0\\[specific term\\]\" (e.g., \"#Never mention: Julius Caesar\").*\n\nIt *can* help avoid certain topics or terms if needed, but it\u2019s also risky. Because once you mention something\u2014even to avoid it. It stays in the context window. The model might still bring it up or get weirdly vague. I\u2019d say only use this if you\u2019re confident in what you're doing. Positive prompting (\u201cfocus on X\u201d instead of \u201cdon\u2019t mention Y\u201d) usually works better.\n\n**4. Template Transformer**  \nLet\u2019s say ChatGPT gives you a cool structured output, like a content calendar or a detailed checklist. You can just say:  \n*\"Transform this into a re-usable template.\"*\n\nIt\u2019ll replace specific info with placeholders so you can re-use the same structure later with different inputs. Helpful if you want to standardize your workflows or build prompt libraries for different use cases.\n\n**5. Prompt Fixer by TeachMeToPrompt (free tool)**  \nThis one's simple, but kinda magic. Paste in any prompt and any language, and [TeachMeToPrompt]( rewrites it to make it clearer, sharper, and way more likely to get the result you want from ChatGPT. It keeps your intent but tightens the wording so the AI actually understands what you\u2019re trying to do. Super handy if your prompts aren\u2019t hitting, or if you just want to save time guessing what works.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kptzqt/5_chatgpt_prompts_most_people_dont_know_but_should/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India's bluntest weapon in geopolitical warfare: Indian Media", "summary": "Now that fog of war is settling a little bit, time for India to take a look at what we could have done better. First of all, this post is not going to be about an individual media houses and this subreddit is meant for International geopolitics, so please do not bring in the domestic politics subjects in this discussion. Do not use this post as pro-government or anti-government discussion. This post is meant for media landscape in India.\n\n---\n\nI have previous written about media and propaganda in a post a couple of years ago ([\"State Media and Propaganda\"]( Go through that a bit if you feel like it. Any way, back to the topic. \n\nThe way Indian media has conducted itself in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor was just embarrassing. From exaggerating the most minor of the claims to making up an outright lies. Almost all news channels were making up stories about India shooting down F-16 or Indian Navy blowing up Karachi port, just to mention a few. Some other news items were even worse which I will not dignify by including them here. I saw even some \"alternate media\" commentators spreading lies and then justifying it by claiming that it creates panic on the other side and gives India an advantage and that's why it's helpful. \n\nHow does this accomplish anything? This is not 19th century any more. Most of the fake news can be easily debunked with a cell phone. What this does is it reduces India's ability to set a discourse in international forums. Most of the international publications that cite Indian media for any news information keep using the words \"alleged\" so frequently and I don't blame them. If I were the editor, I would do the same. \n\nInternational media has portrayed India-Pakistan conflict as a nuisance issue. They almost always portray this as \"both sides\" issue. They either don't understand or deliberately ignore the nuances of India-Pakistan relations and Pakistan support for terrorism. Neutral audience or influential audience will fall back to relying on international media even though they are heavily biased because of garbage reliability of our media. \n\nI understand the commercial obligations of media and they have to chase ad money by any means necessary and keep viewers engaged but DD news does not have any such obligation. They are run by Indian government. They should have focused on more grounded, evidence based reporting. What this ends up doing is harming both domestic audience and India's international messaging. \n\nPlease don't point to Pakistan news coverage. We are not competing with Pakistan, we are competing with developed economies and it's time our media start to reflect that.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1kq4huy/indias_bluntest_weapon_in_geopolitical_warfare/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What's the most accurate speech to text transcription model for casual voice recordings?", "summary": "Prerecorded audio call, completely casual by regular people.

Some of my reports are 20\u201340 pages long (10,000\u201320,000+ words!). I often follow up by asking for an executive summary or slide deck.  I often benchmark the same report between ChatGTP or Gemini to see which creates the better report.   I am interested in differences betwee deep research prompts across platforms.\n\nI have been able to create some pretty good prompts for  \n\\- Ultimate guides on topics like MCP protocol and vibe coding  \n\\- Create a masterclass on any given topic taught in the tone of the best possible public figure  \n\\- Competitive intelligence is one of the best use cases I have found   \n\n\n**5 Major Deep Research Updates** \n\n1. ChatGPT now lets you export Deep Research reports as PDFs\n\nThis should\u2019ve been there from the start \u2014 but it\u2019s a game changer. Tables, charts, and formatting come through beautifully. No more copy/paste hell.\n\nOpen AI issued an update a few weeks ago on how many reports you can get for free, plus and pro levels:  \n**April 24, 2025 update**: We\u2019re significantly increasing how often you can use deep research\u2014Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users now get 25 queries per month, Pro users get 250, and Free users get 5. This is made possible through a new lightweight version of deep research powered by a version of o4-mini, designed to be more cost-efficient while preserving high quality. Once you reach your limit for the full version, your queries will automatically switch to the lightweight version.\n\n2. ChatGPT can now connect to your GitHub repo\n\nIf you\u2019re vibe coding, this is pretty awesome. You can ask for documentation, debugging, or code understanding \u2014 integrated directly into your workflow.\n\n3. I believe Gemini 2.5 Pro now rivals ChatGPT for Deep Research (and considers 10X more websites)\n\nGoogle's massive context window makes it ideal for long, complex topics. Plus, you can export results to Google Docs instantly. Gemini documentation says on the paid $20 a month plan you can run 20 reports per day! I have noticed that Gemini scans a lot more web sites for deep research reports - benchmarking the same deep research prompt Gemini get to 10 TIMES as many sites in some cases (often looks at hundreds of sites).\n\n3. Claude has entered the Deep Research arena\n\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude gives unique insights from different sources for paid users. It\u2019s not as comprehensive in every case as ChatGPT, but offers a refreshing perspective.\n\n4. Perplexity and Grok are fast, smart, but shorter\n\nGreat for 3\u20135 page summaries. Grok is especially fast. But for detailed or niche topics, I still lean on ChatGPT or Gemini.\n\nOne final thing I have noticed, the context windows are larger for plus users in ChatGPT than free users. And Pro context windows are even larger. So Seep Research reports are more comprehensive the more you pay. I have tested this and have gotten more comprehensive reports on Pro than on Plus.\n\nChatGPT has different context window sizes depending on the subscription tier.\u00a0Free users have a 8,000 token limit, while Plus and Team users have a 32,000 token limit.\u00a0Enterprise users have the largest context window at 128,000 tokens\n\nLonger reports are not always better but I have seen a notable difference.\n\nThe HUGE context window in Gemini gives their deep research reports an advantage.\n\nAgain, I would love to hear what deep research prompts and topics others are having success with.  \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1kqasuk/recent_updates_to_deep_research_offerings_and_the/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fine-Tuning your LLM and RAG explained in plain simple English!", "summary": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm building a blog\u00a0[LLMentary](\u00a0that aims to explain LLMs and Gen AI from the absolute basics in plain simple English.

Today's vibe coding only existed for 5 minutes.\n\nBut what I'm talking about is the 'moral equivalent'. Most people going into vibe coding the problem isn't that they don't know how to code.\n\nYesterday's 'idea' founders didn't know how to code either... they just raised funding, got a team together, and bombarded them with 'prompts' for their 'vision'.\n\nJust like today's vibe coders they didn't think about things like 'is this actually the right solution' or 'shouldn't we take a week to just think instead of just hacking'.\n\nIt was just task after task 'vibe coded' out to their new team burning through tons of VC money while they hoped to blow up.\n\nDon't fall into that trap if you start building something with AI as your vibe coder instead of VC money and a bunch of folks who believe in your vision but are utterly confused for half their workday what on earth you actually want.\n\nGo slower - think everything through.\n\nThere's a reason UX designers exist. There's a reason senior developers at big companies often take a week to just think and read existing code before they start shipping features after they move to a new team.\n\nSometimes your idea is great but your solution for 'how to do it' isn't... being open to that will help you use AI better. Ask it 'what's bad about this approach?'. Especially smarter models. 'What haven't I thought of?'. Ask Deep Research tools 'what's been done before in this space, give me a full report into the wins and losses'.\n\nDo all that stuff before you jump into Cursor and just start vibing out your mission statement.

After 11 years in prison she was released, ran for Indian parliament, and won.", "summary": "I'll give a TL;DR version of the story. Phoolan Devi was born in Uttar Pradesh in 1963 to a low-caste family. Her family was very poor as a result of being cheated out of a piece of property. She was married at age 11 to a man who was 3 times her age but she left him and returned home. At age 15 she was kidnapped by a group of bandits eventually joining them and becoming the lover of the group's leader. The gang robbed higher caste individuals and villages and Phoolan became an icon to many lower caste people. But her lover was killed by another faction in the gang and Phoolan was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by the new leader and several other gang members. She eventually escaped formed a new gang and sought her revenge. On February 14, 1981 (quite fittingly Valentine's Day) her gang entered the village of Behmai where Phoolan had been held captive looking for her rapists. In events that are still disputed to this day 22 men were shot, 20 of them fatally. Despite the disputed circumstances Phoolan was held responsible for the Behmai massacre and charged in absentia. After two years of evading capture Phoolan struck a deal with the government and surrendered peacefully. The government almost immediately violated the deal and Phoolan spent 11 years in prison with her case not going to trial. She was released in 1994 when the chief minister (basically equivalent to a US state governor) dismissed all charges against Phoolan. Phoolan entered politics with a desire to help other women and lower caste people. She was elected to Indian Parliament in 1996, lost reelection in 1998 and won her seat back in 1999. She was assasinated in 2001 by three gunmen only one of whom has been identified.", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoolan_Devi", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Made a Davia: like Lovable but for Python devs: ", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/h9tldkht4p1f1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\udd25 SCATTERED Tasks &amp; Notes EVERYWHERE?
