Some examples are Rhetogenes, Carus or Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor, who after his passage through Hispania his name would have one more addition: Numantinus. That last one, Scipio, had to wage his own internal battle before entering the conflict in the city of Numancia.\n\nUpon arriving in Hispania, the Roman general did not immediately launch the attack with the speed and decision that was expected. But it took several months to start his war campaign. This was due to the situation Scipio found himself in his own camp.\n\nWhat he saw upon arrival was discouraging: A Roman military corps that [was far from the discipline and diligence that was expected]( It was a demoralized and poorly trained army after long years of war and defeats. In view of this scenario, Scipio set out to restore Roman honor and pride to these soldiers and **dressed a black cloak as a sign of mourning until he managed to turn these men back into an army worthy of Rome**. He began by forbidding wine and expelling prostitutes from the camps, and during those [months he trained them relentlessly](\n\nThe soldiers were regaining the physical form and tactical capability expected of a Roman army. But there was an extra factor that ended up being crucial: While most of the Roman high-ranking officials were mere strategists who remained away from the battle, Scipio earned the respect and admiration of his soldiers by personally participating in the clashes against the Celtiberians, when they attacked the construction of the encirclement.\n\nThis story that not many know, shows us how even those who have lost confidence in themselves can be reborn with will and under the leadership of someone who guides and trains them tirelessly.\n\nMore, in English, Spanish and German, in [Numantia Archaeology and History](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/1c0q3ph/scipios_mourning_in_hispania_the_generals/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitGab: easily connect your repos to LLMs (chatgpt + claude)", "summary": "", "link": "https://gitgab.ai", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Strategic military infra upgrade in the works for Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/strategic-military-infra-upgrade-in-the-works-for-andaman-nicobar-islands-9261093/lite/?utm_source=Just_Now&amp;utm_medium=Referral", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\"Schedule-Free Learning - A New Way to Train\" [Schedule-Free Optimization in PyTorch]", "summary": "**GitHub**: [\n\n***TLDR*** *Faster training without schedules - no need to specify the stopping time/steps in advance!*", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1c0d669/schedulefree_learning_a_new_way_to_train/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mixtral 8x22B: AI startup Mistral releases new open language model", "summary": "\ud83d\udc49 Paris-based AI startup Mistral has released Mixtral-8x22B MoE, a new open language model, via a torrent link.
