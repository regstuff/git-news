That offence also carries a potential prison sentence of up to three years.\n\nB\u0105kiewicz, who is the leader of a self-declared Border Defence Movement that has sought to\u00a0[stop Germany from returning migrants](\u00a0to Poland, today attended the regional prosecutor\u2019s office in Warsaw to hear the charges and declare himself not guilty.\n\nSpeaking afterwards to supporters, he said that the charges against him are a violation of his constitutional right to free speech and part of a \u201cpolitical circus\u201d. B\u0105kiewicz also claimed that he had not even been referring to Tusk in the parts of the speech interpreted by prosecutors as a threat.\n\n\u201cIf anyone listened to my speech, I was talking about the system, not the people,\u201d B\u0105kiewicz later told broadcaster Radio Maryja. \u201cI don\u2019t think I even mentioned Donald Tusk by name.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Tusk himself had, in 2021, quoted a poem about using a \u201crope and a branch\u201d against \u201cauthorities who raise their hand against the nation\u201d in reference to PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda. Tusk subsequently faced no action from prosecutors, who B\u0105kiewicz said have double standards.\n\nB\u0105kiewicz has a history of making inflammatory statements aimed those he perceives as enemies of Poland. In 2019, when he was the main organisers of the annual nationalist Independence March in Warsaw, he called for \u201cLGBT totalitarianism\u201d to be \u201cfought with fire, literally with fire\u201d.\n\nDuring mass protests against the tightening of the abortion law in 2020, he\u00a0[formed](\u00a0a self-declared \u201cCatholic self-defence force\u201d, promising to \u201ccrush and destroy\u201d those threatening churches.\n\nHe was later convicted of a \u201chooligan act\u201d after he and his followers physically removed a female protester from in front of a church during those protests.
