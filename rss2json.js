Here's what I found to be most interesting. (If you want more info, full down down available [here](\n\n* Many typical best practices still apply, such as\u00a0[few shot prompting]( making instructions clear and specific, and inducing planning via\u00a0[chain of thought prompting](\n* GPT-4.1 follows instructions more closely and literally, requiring users to be more explicit about details, rather than relying on implicit understanding. This means that prompts that worked well for other models might not work well for the GPT-4.1 family of models.\n\n&gt;Since the model follows instructions more literally, developers may need to include explicit specification around what to do or not to do. Furthermore, existing prompts optimized for other models may not immediately work with this model, because existing instructions are followed more closely and implicit rules are no longer being as strongly inferred.\n\n* GPT-4.1 has been trained to be very good at using tools. Remember, spend time writing good tool descriptions!\u00a0\n\n&gt;Developers should name tools clearly to indicate their purpose and add a clear, detailed description in the \"description\" field of the tool. Similarly, for each tool param, lean on good naming and descriptions to ensure appropriate usage. If your tool is particularly complicated and you'd like to provide examples of tool usage, we recommend that you create an\u00a0# Examples\u00a0section in your system prompt and place the examples there, rather than adding them into the \"description's field, which should remain thorough but relatively concise.\n\n* For long contexts, the best results come from placing instructions both before and after the provided content. If you only include them once, putting them\u00a0**before**\u00a0the context is more effective. This differs from\u00a0[Anthropic\u2019s guidance]( which recommends placing instructions, queries, and examples\u00a0**after**\u00a0the long context.\n\n&gt;If you have long context in your prompt, ideally place your instructions at both the beginning and end of the provided context, as we found this to perform better than only above or below.

As someone deeply immersed in developing prompting techniques for Claude and other LLMs, I've noticed a significant shift away from simple instruction-based prompting toward more sophisticated approaches that leverage the increased capabilities of modern AI systems.\n\n\n\nIn this post, I'll share several cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques that have dramatically improved my results with the latest LLMs. These approaches go beyond the standard \"role + task + format\" template that dominated early prompt engineering discussions.\n\n\n\n\\## 1. Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting\n\n\n\nOne of the most powerful techniques I've been experimenting with is what I call \"Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting\" (RSIP). This approach leverages the model's ability to critique and improve its own outputs iteratively.\n\n\n\n\\### How it works:\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\n\nI need you to help me create \\[specific content\\]. Follow this process:\n\n\n\n1. Generate an initial version of \\[content\\]\n\n2. Critically evaluate your own output, identifying at least 3 specific weaknesses\n\n3. Create an improved version addressing those weaknesses\n\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 two more times, with each iteration focusing on different aspects for improvement\n\n5. Present your final, most refined version\n\n\n\nFor your evaluation, consider these dimensions: \\[list specific quality criteria relevant to your task\\]\n\n\\\\\\\n\n\n\nI've found this particularly effective for creative writing, technical documentation, and argument development. The key is specifying different evaluation criteria for each iteration to prevent the model from fixating on the same improvements repeatedly.\n\n\n\n\\## 2. Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD)\n\n\n\nLLMs often struggle with complex multi-part tasks that require careful reasoning. Context-Aware Decomposition is a technique that breaks down complex problems while maintaining awareness of the broader context.\n\n\n\n\\### Implementation example:\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\n\nI need to solve the following complex problem: \\[describe problem\\]\n\n\n\nPlease help me by:\n\n\n\n1. Identifying the core components of this problem (minimum 3, maximum 5)\n\n2. For each component:\n\n   a. Explain why it's important to the overall problem\n\n   b. Identify what information or approach is needed to address it\n\n   c. Solve that specific component\n\n3. After addressing each component separately, synthesize these partial solutions, explicitly addressing how they interact\n\n4. Provide a holistic solution that maintains awareness of all the components and their relationships\n\n\n\nThroughout this process, maintain a \"thinking journal\" that explains your reasoning at each step.\n\n\\\\\\\n\n\n\nThis approach has been revolutionary for solving complex programming challenges, business strategy questions, and intricate analytical problems. The explicit tracking of relationships between components prevents the \"tunnel vision\" that often occurs with simpler decomposition approaches.\n\nto be continued ....  \ntell me in the comments which of these tech you love most :)   \nif you are interested about my work you can follow me in [ you can find free prompts for several niches :) Happy Friday ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k7jrt7/advanced_prompt_engineering_techniques_for_2025/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Alternative to NotebookLM/Perplexity with Privacy", "summary": "Hey everyone, first of all, I\u2019d like to thank this community.
