This situation proved quite frustrating, which led us to recently pivot our efforts toward solving the last mile delivery challenge of running AI models on local devices.\n\nFluidAudio is one of our first products in this new direction. It's a Swift SDK that provides ASR, VAD, and Speaker Diarization capabilities, all powered by CoreML models. Our current focus centers on supporting models that leverage ANE/NPU usage, and we plan to release a Windows SDK in the near future.[](  \nOur focus is on automating the last mile delivery effort so we want to make sure that derivatives of open source are given back to the community. \n\n[", "link": "https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iskustva sa putovanja  Instagram stranicom agentzaputovanja_", "summary": "Pozdrav,\n\nzanima me da li je neko putovao preko stranice agentzaputovanja\\_ (na Instagramu)?\n\nOni cesto objavljuju veoma povoljna putovanja, pa me zanima da li je neko imao isustva, da li je u pitanju prevara, gde se moze vise naci o njima, kakvi budu uslovi?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1n7cyqd/iskustva_sa_putovanja_instagram_stranicom/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Senko - Very fast speaker diarization", "summary": "1 hour of audio processed in 5 seconds (RTX 4090, Ryzen 9 7950X). \\~17x faster than Pyannote 3.1.\n\nOn M3 Macbook Air, 1 hour in 23.5 seconds (\\~14x faster).\n\nThese are figures for a custom speaker diarization pipeline I've developed called Senko; it's a modified version of the pipeline found in the excellent 3D-Speaker project by Alibaba Research.\n\nCheck it out here: [\n\nMy optimizations/modifications were the following:\n\n* changed VAD model\n* multi-threaded Fbank feature extraction\n* batched inference of CAM++ embeddings model\n* clustering is accelerated by RAPIDS, when NVIDIA GPU available\n\nOptimizations aside, massive credit needs to be given to the CAM++ speaker embeddings model, whose efficiency is where the majority of the speed comes from.\n\nThis pipeline powers the Zanshin media player, which is an attempt at a usable integration of diarization in a media player.\n\nCheck it out here: [\n\nLet me know what you think!
