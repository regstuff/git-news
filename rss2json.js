Could the model infer such things ? \n\nI don't want to just use a GPT prompt as my understanding is that it wouldn't be as precise as building my own solution.\n\n  \nSome sort of higher-lever sentiment classification in a way.\n\n  \nSorry for my newbieness, I would appreciate all answers even if they're really technical, I don't mind diving into papers.\n\n  \nLove &lt;3", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1dvmf7c/use_nlp_to_extract_complex_ideas/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK's Labour sweeps to power as Sunak concedes election", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-labour-win-massive-election-majority-exit-poll-shows-2024-07-04/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin calls Taliban Russia's 'ally' in combating terrorism", "summary": "", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2476696/putin-calls-taliban-russias-ally-in-combating-terrorism", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gen Z and millennials are trying to save the planet (and ease their climate anxiety) by quitting jobs that aren\u2019t eco-friendly", "summary": "", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-half-gen-z-millennial-103546494.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak To Resign As Both PM And Conservative Party Leader ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunak-resign-prime-minister-conservative-leader-2024-07-05/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - darrenburns/posting: The modern API client that lives in your terminal.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/darrenburns/posting?tab=readme-ov-file", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian armor-piercing tank rounds to be made in India, Rostec says", "summary": "", "link": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Russian-armor-piercing-tank-rounds-to-be-made-in-India-Rostec-says", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU confirms steep tariffs on Ch\u0131nese electric vehicles, effective immediately", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/07/04/eu-confirms-steep-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles-effective-immediately", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 calls first round of French elections \u2018catastrophic\u2019 after country\u2019s lurch to the far-right", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 calls first round of French elections \u2018catastrophic\u2019 after country\u2019s lurch to the far-right</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMDQvc3BvcnQva3lsaWFuLW1iYXBwZS1mcmVuY2gtZWxlY3Rpb25zLWZpcnN0LXJvdW5kLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018I\u2019m really proud of our team\u2019: Lewis Hamilton praises England\u2019s Euros resilience ahead of his final British GP with ...", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018I\u2019m really proud of our team\u2019: Lewis Hamilton praises England\u2019s Euros resilience ahead of his final British GP with ...</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMDUvc3BvcnQvbGV3aXMtaGFtaWx0b24tYnJpdGlzaC1ncC1lbmdsYW5kLWV1cm9zLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-05", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jesse Owens\u2019 achievements at 1936 Olympics were \u2018thumb in the eye\u2019 to Adolf Hitler, says US athlete\u2019s grandson", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Jesse Owens\u2019 achievements at 1936 Olympics were \u2018thumb in the eye\u2019 to Adolf Hitler, says US athlete\u2019s grandson</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMDQvc3BvcnQvamVzc2Utb3dlbnMtZ3JhbmRzb24tMTkzNi1vbHltcGljcy1iZXJsaW4tc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Joey Chestnut takes on rival challenge after being barred from Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Joey Chestnut takes on rival challenge after being barred from Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMDQvc3BvcnQvbmF0aGFucy1mYW1vdXMtaG90LWRvZy1lYXRpbmctY29udGVzdC1qb2V5LWNoZXN0bnV0LXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA3LzA0L3Nwb3J0L25hdGhhbnMtZmFtb3VzLWhvdC1kb2ctZWF0aW5nLWNvbnRlc3Qtam9leS1jaGVzdG51dC1zcHQtaW50bA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-04", "author": "None"}]}}};
