The most recent signal was the US decision to revoke the Chabahar Port sanctions waiver that India had. This hurts India directly because Chabahar was a big part of our North-South Transport Corridor plan connecting us to Russia. Now that plan looks shaky, while the US is pushing its own IMEC corridor with Europe and the Middle East.\n\nEven though India isn\u2019t the main target, our interests are caught in the crossfire. By tightening pressure on Iran, Washington is not just hurting Tehran\u2019s economy but also indirectly slowing down India\u2019s projects with Iran. At the same time, there are signs that the US wants to re-establish a stronger presence in Afghanistan, maybe even at Bagram Air Base. That could only happen with some level of cooperation from Pakistan. The recent warming of US-Pakistan relations, plus defense agreements involving Saudi Arabia, fit into this picture.\n\nIf that happens, Afghanistan could be used as a launchpad for operations against Iran. Israel also benefits from this pressure because they\u2019ve always pushed for regime change in Tehran. I can\u2019t help but think the US and Israel want to weaken or even completely wipe out Iran\u2019s power structure.\n\nAt the same time, Russia and China are unlikely to stay silent. Both countries have strong ties with Iran, and they see Tehran as a counterbalance to US influence in the region. If Iran is attacked directly, they might step in with military or economic support. Even limited backing like weapons, intelligence, or financial aid could quickly turn a regional conflict into something much larger and harder to control.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m reading too much into the pace of these developments, but the way events are moving makes me think we\u2019re heading toward a major confrontation. If this turns into open conflict, it could easily spiral into something like World War 3.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is the US-Israel push really about wiping Iran out, or is it more about building leverage and reshaping the region\u2019s economic routes?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1nkhz2s/do_you_think_the_us_and_israel_are_building_up/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How reliable are LLMs as evaluators?", "summary": "I\u2019ve been digging into this question and a recent paper (*Exploring the Reliability of LLMs as Customized Evaluators*, 2025) had some interesting findings:\n\n* LLMs are solid on surface-level checks (fluency, coherence) and can generate evaluation criteria pretty consistently.\n* But they often add irrelevant criteria, miss crucial ones (like conciseness or completeness), and fail badly on reasoning-heavy tasks \u2014 e.g. in math benchmarks they marked wrong answers as correct.\n* They also skew positive, giving higher scores than humans.\n* Best setup so far: LLMs as assistants. Let them propose criteria and give first-pass scores, then have humans refine. This reduced subjectivity and improved agreement between evaluators.\n\nThe takeaway: LLMs aren\u2019t reliable \u201cjudges\u201d yet, but they can be useful scaffolding.\n\nHow are you using them \u2014 as full evaluators, first-pass assistants, or paired with rule-based/functional checks?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nkcv6w/how_reliable_are_llms_as_evaluators/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rhinos went extinct in Uganda 40 years ago.

Now the Openwebui logic is that, that person will be the user manager etc. until the end of the world just because he was the first users who set up the environment. The issue comes in that his role was only to set up the Openwebui and not administration of the processes later on. \n\nFor example now when new user registers and goes to pending state, he gets message on screen about it and email address to this first admin.\n\nHow can we change that? We all know that there is more often different levels of admins and roles within the organization than the first god who installed the setup.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1nk3ig7/change_of_first_admin/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Teen who pushed her brother in wheelchair at every high school cross country meet starts new chapter", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/teen-who-pushed-her-brother-in-wheelchair-high-school-cross-country-meet-starts-new-chapter/89-4373433e-6710-4f84-95bf-a3d3e065f938", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Searching for Cleopatra's lost tomb at a temple west of Alexandria, Nat Geo Explorer Kathleen Mart\u00ednez and her team have discovered a 4,300-foot tunnel that led to a sunken port in the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting the location was a maritime hub.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/cleopatra-tomb-port-taposiris-magna?cmpid=org=ngp::mc=social::src=reddit::cmp=editorial::add=rt20250918history-and-culture-cleopatratombporttaposirismagnafreemium", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli minister touts Gaza 'real estate bonanza', defying international backlash", "summary": "Israel's far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said the Gaza Strip could be a \"real estate bonanza\" and that he is in talks with the US about dividing up the territory after the war - an idea previously condemned internationally.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Tel Aviv, he said \"a business plan is on President Trump's table\".\n\n\"We've done the demolition phase...

My current approach to sample a hard negative for each question picks the segment (amongst the 40,000) that fulfills the following criteria:\n\n(1) The cosine similarity between the negative and the anchor should be higher than the cosine similarity between the anchor and positive.\n\n(2) The cosine similarity between the negative and the anchor should be higher than the cosine similarity between the positive and negative\n\n(3) The topic vector (a bespoke vector of size 2 containing 1 main and 1 second-level topic) between both anchor and negative should match on index 0 but differ on index 1 (i.e., overall topic the same, but specificity is different)\n\nThis creates a dataset of roughly 1,000 hard negatives which aren't bad but oftentimes too close to the positive. Therefore I'd like to know whether there are any other considerations that I could take into account to create an improved dataset. \n\nAny ideas are welcome!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nk64ml/techniques_for_automatic_hard_negatives_dataset/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Great Bubble of China | Chinese \u201cghost cities\u201d and the fall of Evergrande", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/wrv9rb4spupf1.png", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
