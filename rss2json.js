The carcass was partially skinned and parts were missing, including internal organs.\n\nIt was also unclear who had reported its presence to the authorities, especially as it was located in a \u201cplace where no one goes\u201d, local farmer Janusz Terka told industry news service Farmer.pl.\n\n\u201cThis boar didn\u2019t die there from disease, nor did it die because it was shot.

The measure was approved by all parties apart from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\nThe idea has been discussed for years, and was previously\u00a0[approved by the Bundestag](\u00a0in 2020. In June, a\u00a0[temporary memorial](\u00a0was erected. But some in Poland criticised the form that it took \u2013 a simple stone boulder \u2013 saying that it was underwhelming and undignified given the scale of Polish suffering in the war.\n\nToday\u2019s resolution, which was proposed by Germany\u2019s two ruling groups, the CDU/CSU and SPD, obliges the federal government to launch a competition to design the permanent memorial with the involvement of Polish experts, reports the Onet news website.\n\nIt also identifies the location of the temporary memorial \u2013 which sits at the former site of the former Kroll Opera House \u2013 as the most appropriate place for the permanent one. It was there, on 1 September 1939, that Hitler announced the\u00a0[invasion of Poland](\n\nAs well as the CDU/CSU and SPD, the Greens and The Left also voted in favour of the motion. However, two members of the far-right AfD, which is the largest opposition party, voted against it while the remainder abstained.\n\nThe co-leader of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla, recently\u00a0[said](\u00a0that Poland is as great a threat to Germany as Russia. Previous statements by leading AfD figures downplaying Nazi crimes have provoked anger in Poland\n\nOn Monday this week, during\u00a0[intergovernmental talks](\u00a0between Poland and Germany in Berlin, the issue of a permanent memorial was raised by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\n\n\u201cYes, the German-Polish agenda should point toward the future.\u00a0But we cannot and we do not want to erase history,\u201d said Merz, speaking alongside his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk. \u201cWe must keep memory alive, even the painful memories.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are initiating the construction of a permanent memorial to the Polish citizens who were victims of Nazi tyranny and the Second World War from 1939 to 1945,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe corresponding tenders on the German side will now begin.\u201d\n\nKnut Abraham, the German government\u2019s representative for cooperation with Poland, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that the competition to design a permanent memorial will be announced in early 2026 and that funding for completion of the project\u00a0will be determined in the federal budget for 2027 or 2028.\n\nIn August 2023, the German culture ministry outlined plans for the memorial, which is to take the form of a \u201cPolish-German House commemorating the suffering that took place in Poland in the years 1939-1945, as well as the cruel death of over five million Polish citizens, including approximately three million Jews\u201d.\n\nWhile focusing on wartime atrocities, the planned Polish-German House is also intended to show historical ties before and after the war, including Germany\u2019s role in the\u00a0[partitions of Poland](\u00a0from the late 18th to early 20th century, the migration of Poles to German lands, and Poland\u2019s integration into the EU and NATO.\n\nThe idea finally received\u00a0[approval from the German government](\u00a0in June 2024. After that, the project passed back to the Bundestag for implementation.\n\nAlmost six million Polish civilians \u2013 around half of them Jews \u2013 are estimated to have died as a result of the Second World War.
