How would I correctly evaluate how it performs?", "summary": "So I am implementing a feature that automatically extracts information from a document using Pre-Trained LLMs (specifically the recent Llama 3.2 3b models). The two main things I want to extract are the title of the document and a list of names involved mentioned in it. Basically, this is for a document management system, so having those two pieces of information automatically extracted makes organization easier.\n\nThe system in theory should be very simple, it is basically just: Document Text + Prompt -&gt; LLM -&gt; Extracted data. The extracted data would either be the title or an empty string if it could not identify a title. The same goes for the list of names, a JSON array of names or an empty array if it doesn't identify any names.\n\nSince what I am trying to extract is the title and a list of names involved I am planning to just process the first 3-5 pages (most of the documents are just 1-3 pages, so it really does not matter), which means I think it should fit within a small context window. I have tested this manually through the chat interface of Open WebUI and it seems to work quite well.\n\nNow what I am struggling with is how this feature can be evaluated and if it is considered Named Entity Recognition, if not what would it be considered/categorized as (So I could do further research). What I'm planning to use is a confusion matrix and the related metrics like Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F-Measure (F1).\n\nI'm really sorry I was going to explain my confusion further but I am struggling to write a coherent explanation \ud83d\ude05", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1h1up89/extracting_informationmetadata_from_documents/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Arizona grandma and stranger she mistakenly texted in 2016 will celebrate 9th Thanksgiving together", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.ktvu.com/news/arizona-grandma-stranger-she-mistakenly-texted-2016-will-celebrate-9th-thanksgiving-together", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A User-Friendly Interface for Efficient Password Cracking", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/ente0/hashCrack", "author": "None"}, {"title": "C Raja Mohan writes: Dealing with the China question", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-writes-dealing-with-the-china-question-9694080/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A guide to build you own SQL query planner/optimizer", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/tuannh982/query-planner-guide", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hot frescoes in the new Pompeii dig", "summary": "", "link": "/r/ancient_art/comments/1h1w0yy/hot_frescoes_in_the_new_pompeii_dig/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hamas Says 'Ready' For Gaza Truce After Lebanon Ceasefire", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.barrons.com/news/hamas-says-ready-for-gaza-truce-after-lebanon-ceasefire-6d7a8846", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin's Forces Under Attack in Syria as Rebels Charge on Aleppo", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/putins-forces-under-attack-syria-rebels-charge-aleppo-1992918", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Former ICC chief prosecutor says she faced threats and \u2018thug-style tactics\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/nov/27/former-icc-chief-prosecutor-fatou-bensouda-threats-thug-style-tactics", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine flag appears on big screen during Putin visit to Kazakhstan", "summary": "lol", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-flag-appears-big-screen-during-putin-visit-kazakhstan-2024-11-28/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dozens of recordings reveal high-ranking Brazilian officers pressured Bolsonaro to stage a coup", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/audios-bolsonaro-brazil-coup-military-6b0dfcf0d14bae79e572b361c2782cd0", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Denmark will plant 1 billion trees and convert 10% of farmland into forest", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/denmark-forest-trees-fertilizer-e55416347fcc385a3ea8e2415726f908", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Chinmoy Krishna Das: India and Bangladesh spar over Hindu monk's arrest", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5v79qpeko", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia\u2019s rouble plunges to lowest rate since early weeks of Ukraine war", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/russias-rouble-plunges-to-lowest-rate-since-early-weeks-of-ukraine-war", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jaishankar slams Western criticism of India's purchase of Russian oil", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/jaishankar-slams-western-criticism-of-india-s-purchase-of-russian-oil-124112601426_1.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Help with choosing the right NLP model for entity normalisation", "summary": "Hello all - this problem has been bothering me for a long time. I dont think there is a quick and easy answer but i thought i may as well ask the experts. I had to deduplicate a dataset containing merchant names. I've cleaned the data to a good extent and achieved a reasonably standardized format for the merchant names (though it's still not perfect). For example:\n\n|Adidas International Trading Ag Rapresentante|Adidas Ag Rapresentante|\n|:-|:-|\n|Adidas International Trading Ag C 0 Rappresentante|Adidas Ag Rapresentante|\n|Adidas Argentina S A Cuit 30685140221|Adidas Argentina Cuit|\n|Adidas Argentina Sa Cuyo|Adidas Argentina Cuit|\n|Adidas International Trading Bv Warehouse Adc|Adidas Bv Warehouse|\n|Adidas International Trading Bv Warehouse Adcse|Adidas Bv Warehouse|\n\nI want to build a model that, given an uncleaned name, outputs the cleaned version. However, the problem I\u2019m facing with using RNNs and CNNs is that when the model encounters an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) term, the predictions are extremely poor, I want the model to learn the cleaning and cluster patterns, rather than learning embedding representation in the training data. My dataset is large, with around half a million observations.\n\nI considered building a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, but it would be difficult to annotate representative data due to the significant geographical variation in the merchant names. FastText isn't ideal for entity recognition in this case, so I'm currently using Sentence-BERT.\n\nI'm looking for a robust model that can generalise well to other similar datasets, using transfer learning.
