In December, the Trump administration began demanding that Australians and other ESTA users entering the US provide biometric information and social media histories, although requirements such as fingerprinting had long been in place in many US airports.\n\nInformation-sharing between the US and other countries has also long been in place for individuals believed to have terrorist or organiser crime links. \n\nHowever, in 2022, the Biden administration announced that in order to maintain participation in the Visa Waiver Program, countries would have to agree to an \u201cEnhanced Border Security Partnership\u201d (EBSP) with the US Department of Homeland Security, under which the US would have full access to other countries\u2019 biometric and ID databases.\n\nIt followed an incident in which\u00a0a UK national who took hostages in Texas had been allowed into the US\u00a0after being removed from a UK terror watchlist.\n\nThe stomach-churning numbers behind America\u2019s deadly ICE raids\n\nUnder the EBSP, US agencies like ICE would be able to access Australian databases to vet anyone entering or seeking to migrate to the US. \n\nHowever, it would not be limited to people seeking to enter the US or who had ever been there. It would also apply to \u201cindividuals encountered by law enforcement in a border or immigration context in the United States\u201d, a clear reference to ICE.\n\nAs well as fingerprints,\u00a0a DHS privacy study\u00a0of the predecessor arrangement to EBSP stated that data sought by US agencies:\nmay include data such as: surnames; first names; former names; other names; aliases; alternative spelling of names; sex; date and place of birth; current and former nationalities; passport data; numbers from other identity documents; other biometric modalities such as facial images; and criminal, police, and immigration records.\n\nThis would clearly include both drivers\u2019 licences and Medicare numbers. It\u2019s unclear what, if any, guardrails there would be.\n\nCountries began negotiating with the US on establishing EBSPs. The UK\u00a0started negotiating\u00a0even before EBSPs were made mandatory, but the European Union has taken much longer. In July 2025, the\u00a0EU commenced\u00a0the formal process of consulting on negotiations with the US,\u00a0alarming privacy advocates and biometric security specialists, who saw it as part of a much larger push by the US to expand its access to biometric data.\n\nThe US has flagged that EBSPs must be concluded by December 31, 2026. \u201cAfter this deadline,\u201d the EU document notes, \u201cthe DHS will assess each country\u2019s compliance with the EBSP requirement during evaluations for initial and continued participation in the VWP.\u201d\n\nAs part of its proposed scoping about what information might be captured by the EBSP, the EU suggests information on\u00a0\u201cthird-country nationals\u201d would be caught, and \u201cmay\u00a0include exchanges on\u00a0citizens and their family members\u201d, suggesting that your personal information could be accessed by US agencies even if you never travel to the US.\n\n\nThere has been no equivalent public announcement by the government here that it is complying with the demand for an EBSP or negotiating one;\u00a0US DHS has not announced\u00a0it has concluded one yet with Australia.\n \n\nAs ICE coverage escalates, so too are White House attacks on the press\n\nWhen asked detailed questions by\u00a0Crikey\u00a0about what stage EBSP negotiations were at, Home Affairs refused to provide any information, merely stating \u201cvisa requirements and policies are a matter for the countries that issue them\u201d \u2014 a clear non-denial.\n\nHome Affairs, via the Australian Border Force, holds extensive biometric information on any Australian who has travelled internationally or any foreign national who has visited here, as well as information gathered by intelligence and security agencies.\n\nHome Affairs and its predecessor, the Department of Immigration, have\u00a0repeatedly tried to slide through significant expansions of its collection of biometric data\u00a0on all Australians, but have been thwarted by parliament\u2019s intelligence committee.\n\nThe most recent attempt in 2019 led to a blow-up between then Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton and Andrew Hastie, after Hastie, as chair of the intelligence committee, rejected a proposal from Home Affairs to turn it into a national biometrics hub for security agencies.\nWhat guardrails there would be around demands from ICE for biometric or ID data on Australians or their families are thus unclear \u2014 even whether it will be limited only to requests about individual travellers or Australians in the US.\n\nFor a government with zero record of pushback against US demands, it seems certain that the Trump administration will soon be able to comb through your most important identifying information at will.

The incident came to light at the same time as \u017burek publicly announced a crackdown on dangerous drivers.\n\nThe minister waived his legal immunity in order to accept his punishment, which was issued because he failed to stop at a pedestrian crossing when a woman was already walking across.\n\n\u017burek, who has served as justice minister since last July, had been appearing on the YouTube channel of Filip Nowobilski, who interviews people while driving in an old Fiat 126 \u201cMaluch\u201d, a tiny car that was a symbol of Poland\u2019s communist era.\n\nWhile the minister was behind the wheel and answering questions, he drove over a pedestrian crossing that, as one of the cameras in the car showed, a woman had already started to cross. That is an offence punishable with a fine of 1,500 zloty (\u20ac356) and 15 penalty points.\n\nThe interviewer immediately drew attention to what had happened, telling \u017burek to \u201cbe careful\u201d and saying that he \u201calmost ran over that woman\u201d. \u017burek denied it, saying that the \u201cwoman was far away from us\u201d and insisting that he \u201cdrives safely\u201d.\n\nHowever, after clips of the incident \u2013 which was first published on YouTube on 25 January \u2013 started going viral on social media, \u017burek issued a statement saying that, \u201cif an offence has taken place, I do not evade responsibility\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are all equal before the law,\u201d he added. \u201cRoad traffic safety rules apply to everyone.

Today, they confirmed that, any analysing the evidence, including surveillance footage from outside the car, they had determined that an offence was committed.\n\nThe police added that \u017burek had agreed to voluntarily waive his immunity as prosecutor general (a position he holds alongside being justice minister) and accept a fine for his actions.\n\nThe minister himself also confirmed the news, telling the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that \u201cthere are no sacred cows\u201d and \u201cthis also applies to me\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is reflection and the words \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cPublic figures should set an example in such situations.\u201d\n\n\u017burek was not directly involved in politics before being\u00a0[appointed as justice minister](\u00a0last year.

Polish production fell only 39% over the same period, from 72.2 million tonnes to 44 million tonnes.\n\nBoth countries, along with six other EU member states, still continue to produce brown coal (also known as lignite), which is generally used for power generation.\n\nIn 2024, the last year that data are available, Germany (92 million tonnes) was the EU\u2019s largest brown coal producer, accounting for 44% of the bloc\u2019s entire output. It was followed by Poland (41 million tonnes), the Czech Republic (23.7 million tonnes) and Bulgaria (15 million tonnes).\n\nPoland remains the EU\u2019s most coal-dependent country, using the fossil fuel to generate\u00a0[over half of its electricity](\u00a0and to heat\u00a0[around a third of its homes](\n\nHowever, production has been in long-term decline, falling from over 250 million tonnes (of both hard and brown coal) to 85 million tonnes over the last four decades, according to Statistics Poland (GUS), a state agency. That has forced the country to import coal, despite its sizeable reserves.\n\nPolish coal has become increasingly uncompetitive, with miners forced to dig ever deeper, labour costs rising and productivity stagnating, some of the same reasons that drove OKD to close the \u010cSM mine in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Polish coal industry survives largely due to heavy public subsidies. In 2026, the state is expected to spend 5.5 billion zloty propping up the sector, after an outlay of 9 billion zloty last year.\n\nThat is thanks in part to the political influence \u2013 and public esteem \u2013 enjoyed by miners, whose unions are very influential, making closing mines a difficult and sensitive issue.\n\nHowever, in 2020, the government\u00a0[signed an agreement](\u00a0with unions that foresaw Poland\u2019s coal mines closing by 2049.
