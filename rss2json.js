Under an asserted \u201cnarcoterrorist\u201d deterrence operation, the United States has thus far carried out [nineteen lethal strikes]( on small boats in international waters, killing at least seventy-six people, all undertaken without the transparency, oversight, or legal foundation that normally governs the use of American force.\n\nSome Americans might be prone to normalize this drift\u2014casually framing Venezuela as a \u201csmall Latin American country\u201d the United States can coerce or remake at will. But before doing that, it might be worthwhile to review the kinds of things most military analysts will assess before planning this type of operation, especially since the U.S. military has undertaken a few \u201cregime change\u201d missions in the last few years.\n\nTo begin with, Venezuela is not small, not simple, and not susceptible to quick, low-cost military outcomes. In geographic and demographic terms alone, Venezuela is enormous. It covers roughly 882,000 square kilometers, making it substantially larger than Ukraine (579,000 sq km) or Texas (696,000 sq km). Its population\u2014estimated to be above [31 million]( people\u2014is roughly equivalent to current wartime Ukraine and modern Texas. It is a country of sprawling mountains, dense cities, jungles, and industrial corridors where military infrastructure sits interlaced with civilian life. Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia, and other urban centers are not \u201csurgical strike zones\u201d\u2014they are vast megacities where any attempt to dismantle regime capabilities from the air risks substantial civilian casualties and cascading regional effects.\n\nA few commentators on cable news shows\u2014eager to portray potential U.S. military action as simple and manageable\u2014have taken to comparing a possible operation in Venezuela to Operation Just Cause, the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama to seize Gen. Manuel Noriega. The analogy is dangerously misleading. That\u2019s because Panama, in 1989, had a population of about 2.5 million spread over an area (75,000 sq km) smaller than the state of South Carolina. The entire country of Panama could be enveloped and dominated by a single U.S. corps-level operation, which is what occurred. And drug kingpin Noriega commanded a small, brittle, and corrupt force that collapsed almost immediately. The Panama Canal Zone gave the United States prepositioned forces, infrastructure, bases, and a finely tuned understanding of the terrain. The objectives\u2014seize Noriega, protect the canal, and dismantle the Panamanian Defense Forces\u2014were narrowly defined and achievable.\n\nVenezuela shares none of those characteristics. It is nearly thirty times larger than Panama, with ten times the population, far more complex geography, urban density orders of greater magnitude, and a regime that has spent years preparing for exactly the kind of irregular resistance the United States now risks provoking. There is no doubt that Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government is corrupt, but it also has dispersed command nodes into hardened or concealed locations, embedded military assets within civilian infrastructure, and empowered paramilitary groups capable of shifting into guerrilla warfare. No serious planner could look at a map of Venezuela and believe it resembles Panama in scale, complexity, or political risk.\n\nOnce any logical planner assesses Venezuela\u2019s true scale, the more apt comparison becomes obvious: A U.S. invasion into Venezuela would mirror the Russian miscalculation in Ukraine.", "link": "https://www.thebulwark.com/p/no-venezuela-is-not-a-small-latin-american-country", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to fight in \u2018hell\u2019: Ukraine veterans say Nato not ready for war with Russia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nato-war-russia-ukraine-soldiers-drones-b2863755.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russian army poised to capture key Ukrainian city Pokrovsk", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.jpost.com/international/internationalrussia-ukraine-war/article-873948", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Britain to make refugee status temporary under asylum overhaul", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-announces-largest-asylum-policy-overhaul-modern-times-2025-11-15/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Less than third of Polish schoolchildren join new health classes after conservative backlash", "summary": "Less than a third of pupils have been signed up by their parents to take part in health education, a new optional subject introduced in schools by the government this year.\n\nThe classes, which teach children about physical and mental well-being, were initially intended to be compulsory. But the government\u00a0[made them optional](\u00a0following a backlash from the Catholic church and conservative politicians, who criticised elements relating to sex education and gender.\n\nMany individual cities and regions have already released data on how many children have signed up for the subject, but on Friday the education ministry released the first full nationwide figures on participation.\n\nThey showed that 30% of all eligible pupils had signed up for the classes, which begin in the fourth grade of primary school.\n\nThe highest attendance was in primary schools (40.36%). By contrast, it was much lower in general secondary schools (10.08%), technical schools (7.78%), vocational schools (14.40%) and art schools (18.33%).\n\nAttendance is stronger in Poland\u2019s more liberal western provinces \u2013 with the highest figures in Wielkopolska (38.59%), Lubusz (38.31%) and Kuyavia-Pomerania (37.26%) \u2013 and weaker in the more conservative east, with the lowest figures in Podkarpackie\u00a0(17.19%), Podlaskie (21.53%) and Lublin (21.72%) provinces.\n\nAmong cities, Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski in western Poland reported the highest attendance at 35.66%, while Rzesz\u00f3w in the east reported the lowest at 14.49%.\n\nHowever, the subject that health education replaced, called education for family life (WD\u017b), which\u00a0[included elements of sex education]( was also only attended by a minority of pupils.

Now, attendance of health education is 56% in primary schools and 11% in secondary schools, according to news website Interia.\n\nThe education ministry has appealed to parents to sign their children up for health education, saying that it helps\u00a0equip young people \u201cwith reliable knowledge and practical skills and attitudes that enable them to make informed health decisions and promote a healthy lifestyle\u201d.\n\nHowever, Poland\u2019s influential Catholic church has\u00a0[expressed opposition](\u00a0to the new subject, claiming that it includes elements that are \u201canti-family\u201d, \u201cgender destabilising\u201d and will \u201cmorally corrupt children\u201d. It appealed to parents not to allow their children to attend.\n\nThe right-wing opposition has also criticised health education, including opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki.

The findings come as the government finalises a bill intended to grant certain rights to same-sex partners.\n\nIn a poll commissioned by the\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*\u00a0daily, CBOS found that 62.1% of respondents support the introduction of same-sex civil partnerships. That is up from a figure of 52% recorded by CBOS last year. In 2011, when CBOS first asked the question, only 25% were in favour.\n\nThe latest poll found that 30.6% of those surveyed believe that same-sex civil partnerships should offer the same rights as marriage. A similar proportion, 31.5%, think that they should have more limited rights.\n\nSupport for introducing same-sex civil partnerships was strongest among the youngest cohort, with 78.6% of those aged 18-25 in favour. The lowest support was found among the oldest group, aged 65+. But even there, 49.7% were in favour and 47.7% against.\n\nPeople with left-wing views (89.9%) were most strongly in favour, followed by centrists (83%). But only a minority of right-wing voters (38.4%) support the introduction of same-sex civil partnerships.\u00a0\n\nIn December 2023, the European Court of Human Rights\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0that Poland\u2019s lack of legal recognition and protection for same-sex couples violates their human rights.

It does not include the right to adopt children or share custody.\n\nIt is intended as a compromise that will satisfy conservative elements in the coalition while also potentially being acceptable to Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.\n\nAfter the plans were unveiled, Nawrocki said that he would not sign any bill that \u201cundermines the unique and constitutionally protected status of marriage\u201d but that he was \u201copen to discussion\u201d about measures to \u201chelp people,\u00a0regardless of their gender, relationships, or age, to manage certain matters\u201d.\n\nKatarzyna Kotula, a secretary of state in the prime minister\u2019s office who is overseeing work on the proposal, told\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*\u00a0that \u201cthe government is putting the finishing touches to a bill \u201d and aims to submit it to parliament by the end of the year.\n\nMilosz Przepi\u00f3rkowski, a strategic partnership officer at Kampania Przeciw Homofobii (Campaign Against Homophobia), one of Poland\u2019s largest LGBT+ rights organisations, told Notes from Poland that he feels the government\u2019s proposed solutions would help with some practicalities but do not go far enough.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I\u2026got married in Berlin, and it was wonderful because we were treated like any other couple.
