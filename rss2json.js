The issue has long soured otherwise strong relations between Warsaw and Kyiv.\n\nEarlier this year, the two countries announced a diplomatic breakthrough that would allow the resumption of exhumations of the remains of tens of thousands of victims that remained buried in unmarked graves in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, progress has been slow so far, with most of Poland\u2019s exhumation requests not yet approved by Ukraine. The heads of both countries\u2019 Institutes of National Remembrance attended today\u2019s talks, and Nawrocki urged them to push ahead on the issue.\n\nZelensky, meanwhile, said that he would \u201ccontinue to support\u201d exhumations. \u201cEach of the victims deserves our Christian respect. We should reach an understanding in this regard and commemorate these victims in an appropriate manner.\u201d\n\nDuring his election campaign, Nawrocki made a number of comments that raised concern in Ukraine, including\u00a0[declaring](\u00a0that he \u201ccannot envision\u201d Ukraine joining the EU or NATO until the issue of World War Two massacres is resolved.

He even suggested that a \u201ccrypto-dictatorship\u201d was being established in Poland.\n\nThe decision has been condemned by justice minister Waldemar \u017burek, who called the judge\u2019s argumentation \u201castonishing\u201d and accused him of \u201ca lack of objectivity\u201d.\n\nPolish prosecutors want to charge Romanowski over 11 alleged crimes \u2013 including participating in an organised criminal group, using crime as a source of income, and abuse of power \u2013 from his time as a deputy justice minister in the former Law and Justice (PiS) government.\n\nHowever, after an\u00a0[arrest warrant was issued](\u00a0for him in December last year, it turned out that Romanowski had fled to Hungary, whose ruling Fidesz party is an ally of PiS. The politician was then\u00a0[granted political asylum](\u00a0later the same month.\n\nMeanwhile, Warsaw\u2019s district court issued an EAW for Romanowski. Hungary has, however, refused to comply with the warrant, as it argues that Romanowski would not receive a fair trial in Poland. That prompted a diplomatic row which resulted in Poland\u00a0[withdrawing its ambassador](\u00a0from Budapest.\n\nToday, Romanowski\u2019s lawyer, Bartosz Lewandowski, announced on social media that the same judge at the same court has now withdrawn the EAW. Lewandowski shared extracts of the judge\u2019s justification for his decision.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible not to note the extremely dangerous interference of the highest-ranking representatives of the executive branch in the sphere of judicial independence, an unprecedented phenomenon for a democratic state governed by the rule of law,\u201d wrote the judge, \u0141ubowski.\n\nHe said that there had been \u201ccontinuous public statements regarding ongoing court proceedings and the issuing of judgments before they have been issued by the court\u201d. This, he added, is \u201cviolates the most fundamental human rights of all accused persons, namely the presumption of innocence\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2026considers it completely unjustified to publicly present the image of Marcin Romanowski as a guilty person who, after being brought to the country, will be convicted and imprisoned,\u201d added \u0141ubowski.\n\nSuch \u201cvile statements are incompatible with the basic standards of a democratic state of law\u201d and \u201cdirectly infringe on the sphere of judicial independence\u201d. Therefore, \u201cthere are serious concerns that the current situation in Poland could be classified as a crypto-dictatorship\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn this situation, continuing to uphold the EAW against a leading opposition representative, after he has been publicly \u2018convicted\u2019 by the most important representatives of the executive branch, would result in a complete loss of credibility of the Polish justice system,\u201d concluded the judge.\n\nThe decision was welcomed by Romanowski, who declared that \u201cthe narrative of \\[Prime Minister Donald\\] Tusk\u2019s gangsters and their lies\u2026is completely falling apart\u201d.\n\nIt means that Romanowski is free to move within the European Schengen area without fear of arrest. However, he cannot travel beyond Schengen as the Polish authorities have invalidated his passport.\n\n\u017burek quickly issued a statement condemning the judge\u2019s decision, which he said had been made \u201cduring a non-public session, without the knowledge or notification of the prosecution, which raises serious procedural concerns\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the justification presented by the judge is \u201cinternally inconsistent and stands in obvious conflict with the case files\u201d, added \u017burek, who serves as both justice minister and prosecutor general.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution is not backing down from pursuing Marcin Romanowski and will file a renewed application for a European Arrest Warrant. If the case returns to the same judge, a motion will be filed to recuse him due to lack of objectivity,\u201d he added.\n\nLewandowski, however, responded by saying that, by trying to remove a judge who had issued an unfavourable ruling, \u017burek was simply \u201cconfirming the court\u2019s assessment that we are dealing with a \u2018crypto-dictatorship'\u201d.\n\n\u0141ubowski is an experienced judge who has headed the international proceedings section of Warsaw\u2019s district court since 2018. It was he who\u00a0[made the decision](\u00a0in October not to extradite to Germany a Ukrainian man accused of involvement in sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines.\n\nToday, the National Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PK) also confirmed that\u00a0\u0141ubowski\u00a0had decided to overturn the EAW on the basis of \u201cnew circumstances\u201d, namely: Hungary\u2019s decision to grant asylum to Romanowski,\u00a0[Interpol\u2019s decision](\u00a0not to issue a Red Notice for him, and the government\u2019s \u201cviolations of human rights\u201d.\n\nThe PK noted that it had not been notified of the date of the court hearing and said that it \u201cconsiders \\[the judge\u2019s\\] decision to be manifestly\u00a0unfounded\u201d.\n\nSince replacing PiS in power in December 2023, the current government has made holding former PiS officials to account for alleged crimes one of its priorities.\n\nHowever, PiS has argued that the Tusk administration is simply pursuing a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d against its opponents, and that it is using unlawful methods to do so.\n\nIn May this year, a group of five Republican members of the US House Committee on the Judiciary\u00a0[wrote to the European Commission](\u00a0expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the rule of law in Poland, in particular that the government is \u201cweaponising the justice system\u201d against the conservative opposition.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/19/court-cancels-european-arrest-warrant-for-polish-opposition-politician-citing-government-rights-violations/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Imran Khan and wife sentenced for state gift fraud", "summary": "Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.\n\nThey were convicted of breaking Pakistan's rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit.\n\nThe pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences - 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine - will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.\n\nKhan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC after the hearing, the former prime minister's lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan's legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours.\n\nThey planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.\n\nThis case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023.
