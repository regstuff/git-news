However, in this case, the reporters argued that no authorisation was required because the statement was published \u201cword for word\u201d as it appeared in the email.\n\nHowever, in a decision that has been criticised by rights groups and other journalists, Warsaw\u2019s district court has now ordered them each to pay a fine of 1,000 z\u0142oty (\u20ac235). They plan to challenge the judgement.\n\n\n\nThe case concerns Micha\u0142 Kaczmarczyk, a member of the programme council of Polish Radio and the Polish Press Agency (PAP), two state-owned media outlets. He was the subject of two articles by journalists Patryk S\u0142owik and Pawe\u0142 Figurski of news website Wirtualna Polska.\n\nIn the\u00a0[first article]( the journalists alleged that people linked to Kaczmarczyk, who was then rector of a private college in the town of Sosnowiec, were selling certifications to virtually anyone willing to pay for them.\n\nThe\u00a0[second article](\u00a0questioned how Kaczmarczyk had come to be appointed to the programme boards of Polskia Radio and PAP, noting his close association with a politician from Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s party who is head of the National Media Council, a state body that oversees public media.\n\n\n\nWhile preparing the first article last year, the journalists received comments from Kaczmarczyk by email and included excerpts in their report. However, last month S\u0142owik and Figurski reported that Kaczmarczyk had called the police on them over the issue and that the police had taken the matter to court.\n\nNow the court in Warsaw has found that S\u0142owik and Figurski failed to obtain the required authorisation from Kaczmarczyk before publishing his statements and has fined them, reports\u00a0*Press*\u00a0magazine.\n\nHowever, S\u0142owik argues that, in this case, there was no legal obligation to seek authorisation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t change or manipulate his statement. We quoted it word for word,\u201d he told\u00a0*Press*.\n\nHe added that they did not publish everything Kaczmarczyk sent them because he wrote about things they had not asked about.\n\n\n\nLawyer Jerzy Jurek explained to\u00a0*Press*\u00a0that the verdict was issued as a penalty order, a type of ruling handed down without the parties\u2019 participation in cases considered \u201cstraightforward\u201d.\n\n\u201cA penalty order is essentially a court\u2019s proposal for a sentence, issued solely based on the indictment and without a formal hearing of evidence,\u201d Jurek said. He added that the recipient has seven days to file an objection after receiving the court\u2019s notice. S\u0142owik says they now plan to take up that option.\n\n\u201cPaying 1,000 z\u0142oty would be faster, simpler and cheaper than spending months arguing in court that there is no need for authorisation of statements someone knowingly sends to journalists,\u201d he said. \u201c\\[But\\] I sincerely believe that I\u2019m fighting for the interests of journalists in this case.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe journalists\u2019 position was supported by, among others, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR), which argued that, when an interviewee provides a written statement and the journalist quotes it faithfully, authorisation is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of authorisation is to ensure the truthfulness of the message and protect against distortion, while simultaneously respecting press freedom,\u201d said HFHR lawyer Michalina Kowala.\n\nKaczmarczyk has also launched legal action against Wirtualna Polska itself as well as its editor-in-chief, Pawe\u0142 Kapusta, over the website\u2019s reporting on him. Last week, a hearing also began in another case he has brought against a local newspaper,\u00a0*Dziennik Zachodni*, for its reporting on the certificates story.\n\nIn a statement issued to\u00a0*Press*\u00a0last month he said that he would not publicly comment on court proceedings in which he was a witness or wronged party.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/06/polish-journalists-fined-for-unauthorised-publication-of-emailed-statements/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'Our job is only killing' - how Sudan's brutal militia carried out a massacre in El Fasher", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dr5e30m5ro", "author": "None"}, {"title": "5,000-Year-Old Winepress and Canaanite Ritual Site Discovered near Megiddo | Ancientist", "summary": "", "link": "https://ancientist.com/5000-year-old-winepress-and-canaanite-ritual-site-discovered-near-megiddo/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Man Brought His Father\u2019s \u2018Piece of the Parthenon\u2019 to Greek Officials.
