His reappointment could be a strong signal to countries like India, whose trade policies have often been a point of friction.\n\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at Brookings and author of *Fateful Triangle: How China Shaped US-India Relations During the Cold War*, recently shared Lighthizer\u2019s critical perspective on India.\n\n[Tweet 1]( Lighthizer in his book: \"would be ideal if the US could have a closer economic relationship with India\" But \"India was just protectionist. That was part of its political DNA, and the best way to deal with that was through unilateral action.\"\n\n[Tweet 2]( Lighthizer re a Trump-Modi mtg: \"I stated our case that \\[India\\] was 'the most protectionist country in the world' &amp; that it was causing a large &amp; growing trade deficit. Americans were losing their jobs because of their practices. They were hurting our farmers\"\n\n[Tweet 3]( Ironic that fmr Trump USTR Lighthizer said this re India: \"India...is also unusual in the extent to which oligarchs influence government policy...In predicting Indian government positions, I would look to the interests of these men.\"\n\nThis appointment could be read as a sharp response to protectionists around the world. This includes Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal who is being [resoundingly criticised]( for blocking open trade. With Lighthizer back at the helm, the U.S. appears serious about pressing India to create a level playing field, pushing for real reforms that foster a free enterprise environment rather than selective protectionism.\n\nHT: CDS", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1gng79c/trumps_trade_hawk_returns_will_lighthizer_finally/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Texas woman sets record for donating more than 2,000 liters of breastmilk", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/09/texas-woman-breastmilk-donation-record#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;aoh=17312055974485&amp;csi=0&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2024%2Fnov%2F09%2Ftexas-woman-breastmilk-donation-record", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At least 24 killed in Pakistan train station bomb blast, police say | Reuters", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/least-4-killed-30-injured-train-station-blast-southwestern-pakistan-2024-11-09/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EAM Jaishankar: India, ASEAN collaboration can be crucial in tackling contemporary issues", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-asean-collaboration-can-be-crucial-in-tackling-contemporary-issues-eam-jaishankar/article68844356.ece", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
