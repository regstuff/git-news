Currently I have built an LDA framework to perform this, but it requires quite a lot of trial and error and fine-tuning to get a sensible result. How I identify the research areas is that I build a TF-IDF, and a word cloud to see what are the possible area names. Now I am exploring using an embedding model like 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' and a clustering algorithm to do this. I have tried using HDBScan, the result was very bad. Now it wonders me, is LDA inherently just better for this task?
