However, Tomasz Siemoniak, the minister in charge of Poland\u2019s security services, said that Warsaw \u201chad expected this\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is simply a reaction to our actions, although our actions were related to the fact that we have no doubt that the Russian security services are responsible for the acts of sabotage, including the recent ones, hence the consulate\u2019s closure,\u201d said Siemoniak, quoted by the Wirtuana Polska news website.\n\nHe noted that the consulate in Irkutsk has played an important role of its connection to the history of Poles exiled by the Soviets to Siberia.\n\nOn 16 November, damage was discovered at two points on a rail line running between Warsaw and the eastern city of Lublin.

Many leading politicians and other officials used the college to obtain MBAs, which then helped them secure lucrative positions at state-owned companies.\n\nSuspicions about the university first emerged in 2020, following the publication of investigations by\u00a0*Polityka*\u00a0and\u00a0*Newsweek*, two leading news magazines.

They are collectively accused of 67 crimes, mostly relating to alleged corruption involving the issuing of false diplomas.\n\n\u201cSearches at the university\u2019s premises confirmed a widespread practice, encompassing not only irregularities in the issuance of postgraduate MBA diplomas, but also bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree diplomas,\u201d wrote the prosecutors.\n\n\u201cA criminal mechanism was revealed, indicating that documenting fictitious studies and issuing unreliable certificates was possible thanks to the complicity of the Collegium Humanum rector, university staff and other individuals, including those holding public positions in state and local government institutions.\u201d\n\nAmong those indicted today is\u00a0[Jacek Sutryk]( the mayor of Wroc\u0142aw (who has waived his right to the anonymity normally granted suspects under Polish law). He is facing four charges relating to fraud and corruption.\n\nProsecutors say that Sutryk, who is technically an independent but is aligned with Poland\u2019s current ruling coalition, paid 9,500 zloty (\u20ac2,243) in tuition fees to receive an MBA, but did not actually undertake any of the required studies.\n\nIn return, the then rector of Collegium Humanum, named as Pawe\u0142 Cz. by prosecutors, was given a position on the council of a municipal technology park in Wroc\u0142aw for which he was paid 75,000 zloty for advisory services that he did not actually provide.\n\nThe prosecutors say that Sutryk was able to use his MBA to qualify for positions on the supervisory boards of three municipal companies, for which he received remuneration totalling over 495,000 zloty.\n\nIn a statement to financial news website [Money.pl]( after today\u2019s announcement, Sutryk \u2013 who faces up to eight years in prison if convicted \u2013 denied the accusations aaginst him and said that he would fight in court to clear his name.\n\nAnother of those indicted is\u00a0[Ryszard Czarnecki]( a former MEP for Law and Justice (PiS), Poland\u2019s main opposition party, and his wife, named as Emilia H. They are jointly accused of two crimes relating to corrupt payments and money laundering involving Collegium Humanum.\n\nAnother former PiS MEP, Karol Karski,\u00a0is accused of accepting financial benefits from Pawe\u0142 Cz. in return for helping obtain a positive opinion from the foreign ministry for Collegium Humanum\u2019s overseas expansion.\n\nB\u0142a\u017cej Spychalski, a PiS politician who served as spokesman for former President Andrzej Duda, is also accused of corruptly obtaining MBAs for himself and his wife, who used her diploma to earn over 56,000 zloty serving on the boards of a hospital and military technology office.\n\nKarski, Czarnecki and Spychalski have not yet commented on today\u2019s indictments. But all have previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nSince a change to the law in 2017, holding an MBA has been a way to meet the requirements necessary to sit on the boards of a state-owned enterprise.\n\nCollegium Humanum, which was founded in 2018, has been accused of exploiting this by effectively becoming a degree factory to provide MBAs for officials wanting to hold such positions.\n\nLast year, the mayor of Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who is a member of Civic Coalition (KO), Poland\u2019s main ruling party,\u00a0[ordered](\u00a0all municipal officials with degrees from Collegium Humanum (which last year changed its name to Varsovia University) to take a new exam if they wished to retain their positions.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/27/leading-politicians-to-face-trial-over-links-to-polish-university-accused-of-corruptly-issuing-mbas/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan Ceasefire Collapses as Fighting Rages", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.military.com/daily-news/headlines/2025/11/26/sudan-cease-fire-collapses-fighting-rages.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Talks That Could Have Ended the War in Ukraine", "summary": "[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1p8s5wl/the_talks_that_could_have_ended_the_war_in_ukraine/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Permitting Multiple Religious Practices in Christian Schools Would Fracture Communal Unity and Discipline- Christian Council", "summary": "Some Background\n\nMission schools are largely funded and operated by churches but still get some government assistance.\n\nThere aren't only Christian mission schools as there are Islamic equivalents but as non-Charismatic Christian mission schools operate the best out of all schools in the country that could be considered public, there is pressure on these good schools to be maximally accommodating aka become more secularized.\n\nThe government doesn't want them to go full private because that would reduce the number of public schools and mission schools are generally better.\n\nThe mission schools on the other hand do accept non-Christian students but also do not want to secularize.", "link": "https://opemsuo.com/permitting-multiple-religious-practices-in-christian-schools-would-fracture-communal-unity-and-discipline-christian-council/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Boko Haram as a hydra", "summary": "THE FRAGMENTED FRINGE\n\nBOKO HARAM AS A HYDRA\n\nFrom ideological rifts to geographical spread, splinter groups like Wulowulo signal a dangerous new phase for Nigerian security.\n\n1. DARUI SALAAM\n\nDATE 2009\n\nSTATES\n\nNasarawa, Kogi, FCT and Niger\n\nREASON\n\nBoko Haram's violent uprising in 2009 was crushed by Nigerian security forces and Mohammed Yusuf was killed, the group fragmented. While Abubakar Shekau reorganized Boko Haram into a full-blown insurgency in Borno State, some of the less radical members and clerics broke away, rejecting Shekau's violent methods. This splinter group relocated mainly to Nasarawa and Niger States, adopting the name Darul Salam (Arabic for \"House of Peace\").\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nOperations spread across Nasarawa, Niger (Shiroro), Kogi, FCT (Abuja outskirts), and with links to Kaduna (Northwest).\n\n2. ANSARU\n\n(JAMA'ATU ANSARUL MUSLIMINA FI BILADIS SUDAN)\n\nDATE 2012\n\nSTATES\n\nBorno, Kano, Kaduna, Kebbi, Katsina and Bauchi\n\nREASON\n\nThe group split from Boko Haram around January 2012, following deep ideological and strategic disagreements with Abubakar Shekau's leadership especially they opposed Shekau's brutality and his focus on killing Muslims rather than government or Western targets.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nPrimarily active in the Northwest, particularly in Kaduna State (e.g., Birnin-Gwari LGA) and the Katsina State and Kebbi State areas bordering Niger (Benin-Niger-Nigeria triborder area).\n\n3. ALIYU NGULDE FACTION\n\nDATE 2014\n\nSTATES Borno\n\nREASON\n\nBetween late 2014 and mid-2015, as Boko Haram intensified its attacks and pledged allegiance to ISIS (becoming ISWAP in 2015), several Buduma commanders rejected Shekau's authority and broke away. These defectors formed what came to be known as the Buduma or Lake Chad Faction, operating autonomously across the islands and marshes of Lake Chad.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nGwoza Hills along the Nigeria-Cameroon border, near the Mandara Mountains.\n\n4. WILAYAT GHARB IFRIQIYYA (ISWAP)\n\nDATE 2016\n\nSTATES\n\nBorno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe and Bauchi\n\nREASON\n\nIn August 2016, ISIS publicly removed Abubakar Shekau as the leader of its West African branch and appointed Abu Musab al-Barnawi (the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf) as the new leader of ISWAP (Wilayat Gharb Ifriqiyya). Shekau rejected ISIS's decision, leading to a violent split between his loyalists (who retained the Boko Haram/JAS name) and ISWAP loyalists (who followed al-Barnawi under ISIS's command).\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nConcentrated in the Lake Chad Basin, Sambisa Forest, Alagarno, and the Timbuktu Triangle (border of Borno/Yobe). They reportedly have \"total control\" over some Local Government Areas (LGAS) like Marte, as well as bases around Damboa, Dikwa, Rann, New Marte, and near the Cameroon border (e.g., Wulgo)\n\n5. MAHMUDA\n\nDATE 2018\n\nSTATES Kwara\n\nREASON\n\nIt emerged around 2018-2019, following internal power struggles within ISWAP between loyalists of Abu Musab al-Barnawi and hardline commanders aligned with Shekau's JAS faction.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nThe leader, Mallam Mahmuda, reportedly leads a cell in and around the Kainji National Park (Niger/Kwara border). A group identified as 'Mahmuda' was specifically mentioned in a recent (April 2025) attack on Duruma village in Karonji, Baruten LGA, Kwara State.\n\n6. BAKURA DORO FACTION\n\nDATE 2021\n\nSTATES\n\nNasarawa, Kogi, FCT and Niger\n\nREASON\n\nFollowing Shekau's death, Bakura Doro, also known as Bakura Sahalaba, a senior Boko Haram commander, refused to join ISWAP and instead established his own splinter faction. This group became known as the Bakura Faction or Bakura Group, composed mainly of loyalists from the Lake Chad Basin and remnants of Shekau's fighters.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nBarwa territory along the tri-border area of Nigeria, Niger, and Chad.\n\n7. WULOWULO\n\nDATE 2025\n\nSTATES\n\nKwara and Nasarawa\n\nREASON\n\nTo extend the reach of Boko Haram beyond the North East.\n\nTHEATERS OF OPERATION\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Sule mentioned increasing insecurity, including killings in Kokona Local Government Area (specifically Ndama village) and abductions in Lafia and Karu Local Government Areas.\n\n\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_--\\_\\_\n\nBoko Haram's fragmentation is a complex legacy of ideological rifts and leadership struggles, producing numerous splinter factions like ISWAP and Ansaru. The recent emergence of the 'Wulowulo' faction in Nasarawa and Kwara states, as cited by Governor Abdullahi Sule, exemplifies this persistent evolution. This spread into Nigeria's Northcentral region underscores the group's adaptive nature and marks a significant geographical expansion of the security threat beyond its traditional strongholds in the Northeast.\n\nSources: SBM Violence Tracker, Media reports", "link": "https://www.sbmintel.com/2025/10/boko-haram-as-a-hydra/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
