I have spoken to my faculty as what I could do to begin approaching the field, but none of there are interested or field or interested in talking to students, and the only answer I received was to look for possible research. As of right now I have been working through the Natural Language Toolkit textbook and I have been enjoying that and finding it interesting. The current math I have completed is: Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Statistics, Calc I; and I am planning to take Calc II and III shortly. I largely use C++ and CUDA, but I have been working a lot in Python and Haskell. I have been told that I should prepare myself to be data science and machine learning orientated and I have done a research project in DS using R and Python, however my institution does not really offer an AI or ML course (program lost funding and resources to be able to consistently offer the AI course so it is in limbo). I have talked with some and they have mentioned that NLP and MT is a largely graduate field of study, so I would be interested in grad school if it let me pursue it further. I am interested in knowing what I can do to learn more or possibly work on projects that can push me more in that direction.
