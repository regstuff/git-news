I know a lot of it isn't efficient, but I tried to structure this project in a way where I take the longer route (choice of model I am using) to understand the general process while achieving a visual prototype at the end, my background is not in AI so I am pretty excited with all of the progress I've made thus far.\n\nThe overall workflow I've come up with:\n\n[pulled from my GH project](\n\n**Where I'm at:** However, I've been encountering some difficulties when trying to fine-tune the model using LoRA adapters in combination with Unsloth. Specifically, the responses I\u2019m getting after fine-tuning are incoherent and lack any sort of structure. I following the guides on Unsloth documentation ( but I am sort stuck at the point between \"I know which libraries and methods to call and why each parameter matters\" and \"This response looks usable\".\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the steps I've taken so far:\n\n* **Model**: I\u2019ve decided on unsloth/tinyllama-bnb-4bit, based on parameter size and unsloth compatibility\n* **Dataset**: I\u2019ve created a custom dataset (\\~900 rows in jsonL format) focused on NPC persona and conversational dialogue (using a variety of personalities and scenarios), I matched the dataset formatting to the format of the dataset the notebook was intending to load in.\n* **Training**: I\u2019ve set up the training on Colab (off the TinyLlama beginners notebook), and the model inference is running and datasets are being loaded in, I changed some parameter values around since I am using a smaller dataset than the one that was intended for this notebook. I have been taking note of metrics such as training loss and making sure it doesn't dip too fast/looking for the point where it plateaus\n* **Inference**: When running inference, I get the output, but the model's responses are either empty, repeats of /n/n/n or something else\n\nHere are the types of outputs I am getting :\n\n[current output](\n\n**Overall question**: Is there something that I am missing in my process/am I going about this the wrong way? and if there are best practices that I should be incorporating to better learn this broad subject, let me know!
