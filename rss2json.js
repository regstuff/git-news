Political leaders fear more violence could derail attempts to restore democracy.\n\nThe death on Thursday of a politically prominent student leader attacked in Bangladesh ignited a wave of unrest in Dhaka, the capital, with mobs setting newspaper offices ablaze in a nation with a shaky hold on democracy.\n\nSharif Osman bin Hadi, 32, died at a hospital in Singapore, where he had been flown for medical care. He had lain in critical condition for a week since being shot in the head on Dec. 12. As a student leader, Mr. Hadi had become an outspoken critic of the authoritarian rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose government collapsed in August 2024 after a monthslong standoff with a youth-led movement.\n\nAccording to the U.N.\u2019s fact-finding report, at least 1,400 protesters were killed last year by the security forces and members of Ms. Hasina\u2019s Awami League party.\n\nAfter Mr. Hadi\u2019s death, protesters poured into the streets of Dhaka late Thursday night, demanding justice. Arsonists targeted not only newspapers but also the homes of several politicians in different cities.\n\nMs. Hasina, who ruled Bangladesh with an iron grip for 15 years, [fled to New Delhi]( last August and has been sheltered by the Indian government ever since. An interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has been running Bangladesh while factions scramble for position. An election, which Ms. Hasina\u2019s Awami League is barred from running in, is to be held on Feb. 12.\n\nMr. Hadi intended to run for Parliament as an independent candidate. He founded a cultural institution after Ms. Hasina\u2019s downfall and led an innovative campaign of handing out leaflets at mosques after morning prayers. He appeared on talk shows criticizing both the Awami League and what he regarded to be India\u2019s malign influence on his country.\n\nHe had spoken about the risks that came with his politics. \u201cWe only want that if someone shoots us dead, they are caught and brought to justice,\u201d he [told an interviewer]( recently.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read a copy of the full article here,]( in case you cannot access the original page.\n\n-----\n\n##See also:\n\n* [Presses fall silent after mobs torch offices of Bangladesh's top newspapers]( (Reuters)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/19/world/asia/bangladesh-riots-student-killing.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU to pay \u20ac3B a year in interest for Ukraine loan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-pay-e3b-interest-per-year-ukraine-loan/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Over 1,000 Were Killed in Attack on Camp in Darfur, Sudan, U.N.
