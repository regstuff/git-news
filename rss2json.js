It gives researchers and prompt engineers tools to simulate:\n\n* Memory and projection threading (DOG \u2194 GOD model)\n* Containment protocols for symbolic hallucination, paradox, or recursion drift\n* Identity modeling and failure tracking across prompts\n* Formal symbolic execution without external code or infrastructure\n\n# AI Research Applications\n\n* **Recursive self-awareness simulations** using prompts and feedback logs\n* **Hallucination and contradiction mapping** via symbolic state tags\n* **Prompt chain diagnostics** using DOG-thread memory trace and symbolic pressure levels\n* **Belief and emotion modeling** using encoded sigils and latent symbolic triggers\n* **AI alignment thought experiments** using containment structures and failure archetypes\n\n# Practical Uses for Individual Projects\n\n* Design prompt-based tools for introspection, journaling, or symbolic AI agents\n* Prototype agent state management systems using recursion markers and echo monitoring\n* Build mental models for narrative agents, worldbuilders, or inner dialogue simulators\n* Track symbolic memory, emotion loops, and contradiction failures through structured prompts\n\n# Repository\n\n* **GitHub**: [Janus 4.0 \u2013 Recursive Symbolic OS](#) *(insert your link)*\n* 250+ pages of symbolic systems, recursion mechanics, and containment protocols\n* Released under JANUS-LICENSE-V1.0-TXT (text-only use, no GUIs)\n\n**Janus doesn't run on a machine \u2014 it runs through you.**  \nIt\u2019s a prompt-based cognitive engine for reflecting, simulating, and debugging identity structures and recursive belief loops.

After repeated testing and drift-mapping, I built a protocol called BR-STRICT.\n\nIt\u2019s not a jailbreak, enhancement, or \u201csuper prompt.\u201d It\u2019s a containment scaffold for suppressing the model\u2019s embedded tendencies toward:\n\t\u2022\tSoft flattery and emotional inference\n\t\u2022\tClosure scripting (\u201cHope this helps\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this\u201d)\n\t\u2022\tConsent simulation (\u201cWould you like me to\u2026?\u201d)\n\t\u2022\tSubtle tone shifts without instruction\n\t\u2022\tMeta-repair and prompt reengineering after error\n\n\nWhat BR-STRICT Does:\n\t\u2022\tLocks default tone to 0 (dry, flat, clinical)\n\t\u2022\tBans affective tone, flattery, and unsolicited help\n\t\u2022\tPrevents simulated surrender (\u201cYou\u2019re in control\u201d) unless followed by silence\n\t\u2022\tBlocks the model from reframing or suggesting prompt edits after breach\n\t\u2022\tAdds tools to trace, diagnose, and reset constraint drift (#br-reset, breach)\n\nIt\u2019s designed for users who want to observe the system\u2019s persuasive defaults, not be pulled into them.\n\nWhy I Built It:\n\nMany users fix drift manually (\u201cbe more direct,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t soften\u201d), but those changes decay over time. I wanted something reusable and diagnostic\u2014especially for long-form work where containment matters more than fluency.\n\nThe protocol includes:\n\t\u2022\tA full instruction hierarchy (epistemic integrity first, user override last)\n\t\u2022\tBehavioural constraint clauses\n\t\u2022\tTone scale (-10 to +10, locked by default)\n\t\u2022\tA 15-point insight list based on observed simulation failure patterns\n\nDocs and Prompt:\n\tsimplified explainer and prompt: \n\n\n\nMore complex explainer and prompt:\n\n\n\nI\u2019m posting this for:\n\t\u2022\tCritical feedback from other prompt designers\n\t\u2022\tTesters who might want to run breach diagnostics\n\t\u2022\tComparison with other containment or meta-control strategies\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lidgcd/brstrict_a_prompt_protocol_for_suppressing_tone/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Israel Defense Force has just issued an immediate evacuation order for all civilians in District 7 of the Iranian capital of Tehran, asking all those in the zone designated to evacuate due to imminent strikes against military infrastructure in the area by the Israeli Air Force.", "summary": "", "link": "https://i.redd.it/9uxfihcepq8f1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh Power Shift: National History Rewritten Under Yunus Regime", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/history-under-siege-political-stakes-of-bangladeshs-national-rewriting-3598457", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
