For context I'm using a finetuned model for a roleplay scenario and provide the character information in the system prompt. It adds up to around 1,600 tokens for the whole system prompt.\n\nThe issue is that when I am talking to the model and asking it questions, it is very inconsistent in its ability to answer accurately. For example it will be able to get the correct % of alcohol in the beers it drinks but not how regurlaly it drinks, or know that it is retired but on asking gives the wrong job it used to do. It is able to give very accurate answers and then immediatedly give completely incorrect ones.\n\nI've previously used the 8B model and not noticed this issue but found it overall to be lacking so upgraded but this is a significant issue. I've tried to look into why this is a bit but come up short outside of the possibility that this is a context issue which doesn't make sense since it should have an enourmous context for this type of task. Is it possible that my training dataset which used Alpacca conversation style caused a reduction in the size of the context due to the short examples? If so how can I adress this.\n\nI thought that maybe it was overfitting since the training data did have examples of bus drivers, but this was only 2 examples of over 1000 and this alone doesn't conclude it being an overfitting problem since if it was a context error it would also likely draw from it's finetuning dataset to replace the information it lacks. I also purposely kept the epoch count low to avoid this.\n\nHow can I go about testing this issue? I know I could implement a system for regular reminders but since it starts confabulating early into a conversation (&lt;500 tokens), it feels like there is a more core problem to address whether that is finetuning, hardware or something else.\n\nFor context I am using a Nvidia A40 so 48GB of vRAM and used Unsloth for the training with these hyperparameters:\n\n    max_seq_length = 4096\n    dtype = None \n    load_in_4bit = True\n    \n    model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 model_name = \"unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-instruct-bnb-4bit\",\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 max_seq_length = max_seq_length,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 dtype = dtype,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit,)\n    \n    model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 model,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 r = 16, # Choose any number &gt; 0 !

I thought I copied and pasted the link into my notes, but my laptop lagged and didn\u2019t copy the URL, so when I thought I pasted the link, a link I had copied earlier got pasted instead. My laptop does this sometimes, and usually I notice, but of course I didn\u2019t this time. I\u2019ve tried looking in my history for this article, but to no avail.\n\nAs I said, the article was on Roman doll furniture. The article was in one of the following journals: Not. Scavi, Bull. Com., Rom. Mitt., BACrist, or Jdl, and was found in the volumes digitized by Heidelberg University. Please note that it was not the article in Not. Scavi 1894. For some reason I can\u2019t seem to find the article now, and even searching for it has yielded nothing. I didn\u2019t actually read the article, hence why I tried to save it, so unfortunately I can\u2019t give y\u2019all more info that maybe helpful.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m aware it\u2019s unlikely someone may know of the exact article I\u2019m referring to (and be able to readily supply the title), especially since there\u2019s a couple journals the article could have been in. But I\u2019m desperate to find the article, irritable, and thought why not give crowd sourcing a shot.\n\nIf anyone is able to figure out which article it is, I\u2019ll everlastingly pray for you good fortune.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1fubzbc/lost_roman_doll_furniture_article/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel bars U.N. secretary-general from entering country", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-bars-un-secretary-general-entering-country-2024-10-02/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Inspirational 101-year-old says young people should 'dance whenever you can'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/inspirational-101-year-old-says-30046478?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=reddit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Miracle twins given just 10% chance of survival now thriving thanks to hero medics", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-twins-given-just-10-33792241?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=reddit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India does not share Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s view of \u2018Asian NATO\u2019, says Jaishankar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-does-not-share-japanese-pm-shigeru-ishibas-view-of-asian-nato/article68706611.ece", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI Platform API Chat GPT and API Replicated", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/baofreeman/AISAAS-WEBSITE", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel plans massive Iran payback with Middle East on edge", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.axios.com/2024/10/02/iran-israel-missile-attacks-response", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Taylor Swift foodbank donation feeds more than 900", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vk3440ze9o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Crews of 700 Canadians help US Hurricane Efforts - and Walmart lets them shop with IOUs", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hurricane-helene-1.7338560", "author": "None"}, {"title": " Iran launches missiles at Israel, IDF says ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/01/iran-readying-imminent-ballistic-missile-attack-against-israel-us-official-tells-nbc-news.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shrapnel from Iranian missile kills Palestinian man near Jericho", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-man-killed-by-shrapnel-from-iranian-missile-near-jericho/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Understanding Manganese Dendrite Formation on Stone and Pottery", "summary": "", "link": "https://galeriacontici.net/understanding-manganese-dendrite-formation-on-stone-and-pottery/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Advice", "summary": "I am in my senior year of undergrad and am in the process of applying for graduate schools and I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s worth it.
