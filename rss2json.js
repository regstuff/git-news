The scope and difficulty is huge, but I know the community has been wanting a structure for Dark souls ai gaming for a while now.

I'd love to hear your feed back, it will influence my decision to either go open source on github or not. Either way, the code as it's stands is a breakthrough as it is and will continue to grow. With collaboration and shared skill and knowledge it would just be better that's all. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from the community. \n\nSummary:\n\n1. Technor AI is an AI that plays and trains in the Dark Souls Remastered Environment. \n\n2. It's primarily been taught the concept of \"fun\" to enhance novelty and exploration in order to become an agent that 100% Dark souls. \n\n3.

Dark souls has sparse rewards, so teaching without an API is challenging.  \n\n4. Looking forward to Jolly cooperation, if it's not your scene no worries, if it is, I'll answer your questions.
