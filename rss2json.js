Middle Eastern oil was at 2.7 million barrels per day recovering their market share in India. Neither use \u20b9 as primary currency, with Russia using Chinese Renminbi instead and in GCC only UAE has started \u20b9-for-oil. The biggest increase is from USA but this is a result of USA\u2019s strong-arm tactics mastered by Trump to arm-twist Modi as they are seeking to reduce Trade Deficit, aside from the refinery-end costs associated with changing type of oil (e.g.: Mangalore one which was designed wholly for Iranian crude) and freight costs\u2026\n\nVenezuelan oil often trades at 30% discount as only specialized refineries (like RIL\u2019s Jamnagar and Nayana\u2019s refinery) can process it\u2026 while due to blanket sanctions on Iran they are offering a 15% discount\u2026 if say India imports upto 600,000 barrels a day from Venezuela and 1.5 million barrels a day from Iran in \u20b9-for-oil mechanism\u2026 this alone is $47 billion in forex savings and $12 billion in discounts\u2026 India has imported this quantum in the past so it\u2019s not unrealistic per se\u2026\n\n\nThis compels a discussion on leveraging our importation of fossil fuels (coal, crude, LNG, and LPG) to arrest economic slowdown, currently at 5.4% which is outright pathetic\u2026\n\nCoal\nIndia imported 254 million short tons of coal in 2023\u2026 here the increase is more pronounced a 14.2% increase\nIndia imported nearly 42% of her needs from Indonesia, 18.5% from Australia and 11% from Russia \nIndonesian coal can be replaced by Russian coal as they have similar gross calorific value, but freight is an issue, that can be reduced by INSTC trade route but Iran would be willing to take part of this only after oil is sorted hence I put that first\u2026 \nI fathom at least 35% coal should be imported from Russia, Russia too is eager for this\n\nLNG\nHere in 2022-23 it was seen that despite a 15% decrease in imports of LNG, the bill increased by 27% indicating premium prices especially during periods of huge supply-demand imbalances\u2026\nRouting this to Iran and Russia can be complicated due to infra and logistics issues but Farzad-B is a lost gold mine for India\u2026 at least India shouldn\u2019t back out from there! Even at current rate of production in Farzad-B gas field (in which India as per original contractual right has 30% stake), 3% of India\u2019s current demand can be met from it\u2026 and India would add 4.14 Tcf of recoverable natural gas to its reserves\u2026 all it\u2019ll take is a $535 million contribution to $1.78 billion development cost (30%) which can change with better terms and increase in stake due to lack of partners on account of sanctions.\n\nLPG\nIndia traditionally sourced it from Iran but has shifted to GCC now (primarily UAE)\n\nCost Dynamics:\n\nCrude Oil \ud83d\udee2\ufe0f\nFY 2023-24: $132.4 billion [232.5 MMT of crude oil]\nFY 2024-25 (April-November): $102.5 billion \ud83c\udd9a $98.8 billion for same period of previous year [~4% increase in import bill \ud83e\uddfe]  \ud83d\udd3a\n\nLNG \u26fd\ufe0f\nFY 2023-24: $13.3 billion [30.91 bcm]\nFY 2024-25 (April-November): $11.7 billion \ud83c\udd9a $9.8 billion [21.2% increase in import bill \ud83e\uddfe]  \ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udd3a\n\nCoal \u26cf\ufe0f\ud83e\udea8\nFY 2023-24: $47 billion [264 million short tons (spiked due to rise in import of non-coking coal)]\nFY 2024-25 (April-November): Decline of 5.35% in quantity of import (bill saving of $3.91 billion)  \ud83d\udfe2\n\nLPG \nThough volume increased due to fall in price the bill was fairly stable here as well   \ud83d\udfe2\nFY 2024-25 (April-December): $9.44 billion\n\nTotal Import Bill in FY 2023-24 for all four fossil fuels: ~$202.12 billion\n\nTrade Deficit in Merchandise Trade in FY 2023-24: ~$240.17 billion \n\nPayments can be routed by UCO Bank as was done previously\u2026 I\u2019ll discuss the options for barter trade as well\n\nWe can potentially arrest 50% of merchandise trade deficit with just one move, but it\u2019ll take robust implementation and seamless coordination with strong international positioning\u2026\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1j1xuox/oil_diplomacy_what_nda_30_can_learn_from_upa_20/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hungarian government plans constitutional change to end LGBTQ Pride march", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarian-government-plans-constitutional-change-end-pride-march-2025-02-27/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
