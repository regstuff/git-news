Our core industrial base continues to expand, with growing contributions in steel, electronics, and defense production. \n\nHowever, despite these achievements, India faces persistent trade imbalances and arm-twisting from the US, which has often exploited its leverage instead of fostering fair trade.\n\n**Indo-US Trade vs. US-Vietnam Trade**\n\nWhile Washington frequently lectures India on trade barriers, it conveniently overlooks its own preferential treatment of Vietnam\u2014a country with far less economic weight than India. The US has inked favorable trade agreements with Vietnam, allowing it significant market access, while India continues to face tariffs and restrictions on key exports.\n\n**Strategic Arm-Twisting**\n\nThe Modi government has repeatedly caved under American pressure especially on defense deals. \n\nTake, for example:\n\n\u2022 The $930 million deal for just six Apache helicopters, an inflated price tag compared to what other nations pay.\n\n\u2022 The NASAMS air defense system sale, which was effectively forced on India in exchange for a CAATSA waiver on the S-400 purchase from Russia.\n\n\u2022 The inflated cost of Predator drones, where India pays far more per unit than Israel for similar technology.\n\n\u2022 Crippling domestic Indian indigenisation efforts wrt the **Tejas** program, by delaying actuators and engines. On top of that having the audacity to pitch a 50-year old platform, albeit with cosmetic changes, and re-branding it as F-21 and now the F-35 drama.\n\nIn a nutshell, India has significantly upped the game in military-industrial policy BUT critical platforms like fighter aircraft, tanks, submarines and ships (navy is much better tho) have good amount of dependency which would need a thoughtful and sound strategy to overcome esp. in the backdrop of China developing its 6th-gen fighters and arming Indian neighbours left and right.\n\n**US Crude Exports &amp; Its Impact on India\u2019s Refining Industry**\n\nIndia\u2019s purchase of American crude, made under geopolitical pressure, has disrupted domestic refineries. Take the Mangalore Refinery, originally optimized for Iranian crude, which had to be reconfigured at high costs, and additional freight charges further increase the economic burden. \n\nMeanwhile, Iran, which historically provided India with cheaper, suitable crude with better payment terms, was sidelined due to US sanctions.\n\nThe opportunity cost of switching from Iranian crude to US crude involves several key factors:\n\n\t1.\t*Refinery Reconfiguration Costs*\n\n\t\u2022\tIndian refineries, especially Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), were optimized for Iranian crude, which has a specific chemical composition.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe shift to US crude required expensive modifications, estimated at $500 million for MRPL alone.\n\n\t\u2022\tOther refiners like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) also had to adjust operations, adding more costs.\n\n\n\t2.\t*Increased Freight Costs*\n\n\t\u2022\t**Iranian crude**: India benefited from low shipping costs due to proximity (~3,000 km).\n\n\t\u2022\t**US crude**: Imported from the Gulf of Mexico (~14,000 km), meaning higher freight costs.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Estimated additional freight cost**: $2\u2013$3 per barrel.\n\n\t\u2022\tWith India importing 5 million barrels per day, assuming 10% (500,000 barrels/day) is switched to US crude in reality this is around 5% or less, that\u2019s an extra $1\u2013$1.5 million per day in shipping costs (~$365\u2013$550 million per year).\n\n\n\t3.\t*Payment Terms: Iran vs. USA*\n\n\t\u2022\t**Iran**: Allowed India to buy crude on credit (typically 60\u201390 days) and often in rupees, reducing forex outflow.\n\n\t\u2022\t**USA**: Requires immediate dollar payments, increasing strain on forex reserves and working capital.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe payment delay advantage with Iran meant Indian refiners had cash flow flexibility worth billions annually.\n\n\n\t4.\t*Interest Cost (If Funded by Loans)*\n              If Indian refiners had to borrow to cover immediate payments to the US:\n\n\t\u2022\tAssume an interest rate of 6% per annum on short-term trade financing.\n\t\u2022\tFor every $10 billion worth of US crude (roughly 10% of annual imports), the interest cost alone would be $600 million per year.\n\n\t\u2022\tWith Iran, this borrowing was often not needed due to flexible credit terms.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe forced shift to US crude not only raised immediate costs but also eliminated the financial advantages India enjoyed with Iran. The total opportunity cost exceeds $1 billion per year, excluding infrastructure adjustments, with knock-on effects on refining efficiency and forex reserves.\n\nShould India rethink its crude sourcing strategy, especially with Iran eager to resume exports? Let\u2019s discuss.\n\n**Market Access &amp; GSP Hypocrisy**\n\nThe US revoked India\u2019s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status, citing our economy\u2019s \u201cgrowth.\u201d Yet, countries like Bangladesh, with a similar or even higher GDP per capita, continue to enjoy these benefits. Meanwhile, China\u2014despite a GDP per capita 5x India\u2019s\u2014was also removed, but its deep economic integration with the US protects it from the kind of targeted pressure India faces.\n\nIndia and Vietnam have both established significant export relationships with the United States, each offering a distinct array of products that reflect their unique industrial strengths and economic strategies, with this vectoring being done as part of China+1 strategy to reduce over dependence of global supply chains on China.\n\n*Nature and Scope of Indian Exports to the U.S.:*\n\nIn 2023, India\u2019s exports to the U.S. were valued at approximately $75.81 billion. The primary export categories included: \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Precious Stones and Metals**: Leading the exports at $10.17 billion, this category underscores India\u2019s prominence in the global gems and jewelry market. \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Electrical and Electronic Equipment**: Amounting to $9.89 billion, reflecting India\u2019s growing capabilities in electronics manufacturing.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Pharmaceutical Products**: With exports worth $7.55 billion, showcasing India\u2019s role as a major supplier of generic medicines. \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Mineral Fuels and Oils**: Totaling $6.52 billion, indicating the export of refined petroleum products. \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Machinery and Boilers**: Valued at $5.99 billion, highlighting India\u2019s engineering and manufacturing sectors. \ufffc\n\nOther notable exports included textiles, vehicles, organic chemicals, and iron or steel articles.  \ufffc\n\n*Nature and Scope of Vietnamese Exports to the U.S.:*\n\nIn 2022, Vietnam\u2019s exports to the U.S. reached approximately $109.46 billion, with key export categories comprising: \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Electrical and Electronic Equipment**: Leading with $38.97 billion, indicating Vietnam\u2019s significant role in electronics manufacturing.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Machinery and Boilers**: Amounting to $10.65 billion, reflecting the country\u2019s growing industrial base.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Furniture and Prefabricated Buildings**: Valued at $10.04 billion, showcasing Vietnam\u2019s strength in furniture production. \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Knit or Crocheted Apparel**: Totalling $9.83 billion, underscoring the importance of the textile sector. \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Footwear**: With exports worth $9.66 billion, highlighting Vietnam as a major footwear supplier. \ufffc\n\nAdditional exports included non-knit apparel, plastics, toys, leather goods, and seafood products.  \ufffc\n\n*Export Trajectories and India\u2019s Opportunity Cost in Foreign Trade:*\n\nOver recent years, both nations have experienced growth in exports to the U.S.:\n\n\t\u2022\t**India**: Exports to the U.S. increased from $54.3 billion in 2018 to $83.8 billion in 2023, marking a growth of approximately 54.4%.  \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Vietnam**: Exports to the U.S. grew from $50 billion in 2018 to $118 billion in 2023, reflecting an annualized growth rate of 18.7%.  \ufffc\n\nBoth countries exhibit upward export trajectories, with Vietnam showing a particularly rapid increase.\n\n*Impact of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on Export Competitiveness:*\n\nThe GSP program offers preferential tariff treatment to developing countries, enhancing their export competitiveness. Vietnam benefits from GSP status with the U.S., while India\u2019s GSP benefits were revoked in 2019.\n\nSeveral Vietnamese export sectors where India is competitive include:\n\n\t\u2022\t**Textiles and Garments**: Vietnam\u2019s exports of knit and non-knit apparel to the U.S. totaled approximately $17.21 billion in 2022. India, with its robust textile industry, could have potentially captured a share of this market under GSP benefits.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Footwear**: Vietnam exported $9.66 billion worth of footwear to the U.S. in 2022. India, being a significant footwear producer, might have increased its U.S. market share with GSP advantages.  \ufffc\n\n\t\u2022\t**Furniture**: Vietnam\u2019s furniture exports to the U.S. were valued at $10.04 billion in 2022. India\u2019s growing furniture industry could have benefited from similar opportunities under GSP.\n\nThe absence of GSP benefits has likely impacted India\u2019s price competitiveness in these sectors, potentially limiting its export growth to the U.S.; U.S.A.\u2019s GSP move against India is an opportunity cost totalling nearly **$37 billion** at the higher side for India annually!!!\n\n**Conclusion on U.S.A.\u2019s step brotherly treatment of India**\n\nWhile both India and Vietnam have strengthened their export relationships with the U.S., Vietnam\u2019s rapid export growth and diversification, bolstered by GSP benefits, have positioned it favorably in the U.S. market. Restoring GSP benefits for India could enhance its competitiveness, particularly in sectors where it competes with Vietnam, potentially increasing its share in the U.S. import market.\n\n**Khalistan &amp; Obama\u2019s Unsolicited Remarks**\n\nIndia\u2019s concerns over Khalistani extremism in the US remain largely ignored, with Washington giving free rein to separatist elements under the pretence of free speech. \n\nMeanwhile, Obama\u2019s unnecessary comments on minority rights in India\u2014coming right after Modi\u2019s state visit\u2014highlight a pattern of unwarranted interference in India\u2019s internal affairs. \n\nAmerican (CIA) interference in trying in propping up neo-Christian states\u2019 separatist movements in the Northeast is well-known and doesn\u2019t need any introduction.\n\n**Time for Reciprocal Tariffs?**\n\nThe US has long benefited from access to India\u2019s growing consumer market while restricting Indian exports and dictating terms on defense and energy. With our rising manufacturing capabilities, isn\u2019t it time for India to impose reciprocal tariffs and demand fairer trade terms?\n\nThe United States has recently threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on various Indian industries, notably the automotive sector, in response to India\u2019s high import duties on American goods.  \n\nThis development presents India with two primary courses of action: \ufffc\n\n\t1.\t**Capitulate to U.S. Pressure and Reduce Existing Tariffs**\n\n\t2.\t**Maintain Current Tariff Structures and Face U.S. Retaliatory Measures**\n\n**Scenario 1: India Reduces Existing Tariffs**\n\nImplications for the Domestic Auto Industry:\n\n\t\u2022\t**Increased Competition**: Lowering tariffs would make imported vehicles more affordable, intensifying competition for domestic manufacturers. This could particularly affect segments where foreign brands have a strong presence, additionally disincentivising indigenisation.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Consumer Benefits**: Consumers might gain access to a broader range of vehicles at competitive prices, potentially elevating overall industry standards.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Pressure on Local Manufacturers**: Domestic automakers may need to enhance quality and innovation to maintain market share, leading to potential short-term financial pressures but fostering long-term industry improvements.\n\n*Implications for Other Industries:*\n\n\t\u2022\t**Electronics and Pharmaceuticals**: Reduced tariffs could lead to increased imports in these sectors, challenging local producers but benefiting consumers with more choices and possibly lower prices.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Agriculture**: Lowering agricultural tariffs might adversely affect local farmers due to competition with subsidized foreign produce, necessitating government support mechanisms.\n\n\n**Scenario 2: India Maintains Current Tariffs and Faces U.S. Retaliation**\n\n*Implications for the Domestic Auto Industry:*\n\n\t\u2022\t**Minimal Direct Impact**: India\u2019s automotive exports to the U.S. are relatively modest, suggesting limited immediate effects on the industry.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Indirect Consequences**: Auto component manufacturers, especially those with significant U.S. exposure, could experience reduced demand, affecting revenues and employment.\n\n*Implications for Other Industries:*\n\n\t\u2022\t**Electronics and Textiles**: Industries with substantial exports to the U.S. might face decreased competitiveness due to increased tariffs, leading to potential revenue declines.\n\n\t\u2022\t**Overall Trade Relations**: Escalation into a broader trade dispute could disrupt bilateral relations, affecting various sectors and possibly leading to a contraction in economic growth.\n\n\n**Conclusion on the inevitable Indo-US Trade War**\n\nEach scenario presents distinct challenges and opportunities. Reducing tariffs could enhance consumer choice and drive domestic industries toward greater competitiveness but may expose vulnerable sectors to heightened competition. Conversely, maintaining current tariffs risks U.S. retaliation, potentially harming export-driven industries and straining economic relations. A balanced approach, possibly involving strategic tariff reductions coupled with support for affected domestic sectors, might mitigate adverse impacts while fostering a more open trade environment.\n\nThis U.S. policy is ostensibly soundbites as India among the top 20 trading partners has one of the most balanced trade relations with U.S.A. and American strategy to prop up a strong India to contain China in the Indo-Pacific seems to be countering American policy. This incoherence is not a first but a feature of *American diabolical-ism*. \n\nLet\u2019s discuss: Should India start levying strategic tariffs on US goods to counterbalance these pressures?
