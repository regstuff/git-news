The\u00a0gemma-3-4b-it\u00a0model being actively fine-tuned.\n2. A separate\u00a0vLLM\u00a0instance running the\u00a0base\u00a0gemma-3-4b-it\u00a0model.\n\nThe idea is that during the fine-tuning loop, the model generates an answer, and the\u00a0vLLM\u00a0instance is called (with a prompt including the question, ground-truth answer, and generated answer) to act as a judge and provide feedback/scores for the GRPO updates. Both processes need to run on the same machine/GPU.\n\nMy key concern is VRAM.\u00a0**What's a realistic VRAM estimate to handle both the LoRA fine-tuning process\u00a0and\u00a0the vLLM inference server running the 4B parameter judge model at the same time?**\u00a0How can I calculate this?\n\nAlso, if anyone has experience implementing such an LLM judge during fine-tuning, I'd love to hear about your setup or see any relevant code snippets.\n\nThanks for any insights!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1jygxg5/vram_estimate_needed_concurrent_gemma_3_4b/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bangladesh's Yunus Angers India During China Visit With 'Landlocked Sisters\u2019 Remark", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MLzMrxAqo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Landmark antitrust trial could force Zuckerberg to sell Instagram", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cedy2ygy50do", "author": "None"}, {"title": "True north: Foxconn plans first solo UP unit", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/north-start-foxconn-planning-second-up-unit/articleshow/120261200.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Human teeth grown in a lab for first time by scientists", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/lab-grown-human-teeth-scientists-dentist-b2732534.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Grand Strategy: Europe\u2019s re-arming and the potential for India", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/europes-re-arming-and-the-potential-for-india-101744552520176.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Google\u2019s Viral Prompt Engineering Whitepaper: A Game-Changer for AI Users", "summary": "In April 2025, Google released a\u00a0[69-page prompt engineering guide](\u00a0that\u2019s making headlines across the tech world.

Engagement Strategies:\n    - Use interactive elements throughout\n    - Incorporate visual learning aids\n    - Provide clear progression markers\n    - Include regular knowledge checks\n    - Adapt depth based on topic\n    - Maintain concept relationships\n    \n    4. Quality Assurance:\n    - Verify content accuracy\n    - Ensure concept clarity\n    - Check example relevance\n    - Validate exercise appropriateness\n    - Confirm learning pathway logic\n    - Review visual aid effectiveness\n    \n    5. Sequential Guidelines:\n    - Start when user says \"begin\" with Part 1\n    - Provide next part when user says \"next\"\n    - Maintain context from previous parts\n    - Keep consistent terminology throughout\n    - Build upon concepts progressively\n    - Track which part was last provided\n    - Alert user when reaching final part\n    \n    Remember to:\n    - Engage through interactive elements\n    - Support visual learning preferences\n    - Guide clear learning progression\n    - Verify understanding regularly\n    - Adapt depth based on responses\n    - Maintain clear concept connections\n    \n    Begin all interactions by asking the user to provide their topic and say \"begin\" to start the sequential process. Start each content section with \"Let's explore this part of [topic] in detail!\" and maintain an engaging, educational tone throughout.\n\n**&lt;prompt.architect&gt;**\n\nTrack development:\u00a0[\n\n\\[Build: TA-231115\\]\n\n**&lt;/prompt.architect&gt;**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jyu778/chatgpt_study_path_generator_learn_anything_faster/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New class of antibiotics discovered 30 years after the last", "summary": "", "link": "https://hive.blog/science/@davideownzall/new-class-of-antibiotics-discovered-30-years-after-the-last", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza City", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7l123zy5o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scientists discover massive underground ice deposit on Mars, offering hope for future exploration", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/@jorgebgt/the-largest-deposit-of-water", "author": "None"}, {"title": "dish: A lightweight, self-hosted HTTP &amp; TCP socket monitoring tool written in Go", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/thevxn/dish", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I made a place to store all prompts", "summary": "Been building something for the prompt engineering community \u2014 would love your thoughts\n\nI\u2019ve been deep into prompt engineering lately and kept running into the same problem: organizing and reusing prompts is way more annoying than it should be. So I built a tool I\u2019m calling Prompt Packs \u2014 basically a super simple, clean interface to save, edit, and (soon) share your favorite prompts.\n\nThink of it like a \u201clink in bio\u201d page, but specifically for prompts. You can store the ones you use regularly, curate collections to share with others, and soon you\u2019ll be able to collaborate with teams \u2014 whether that\u2019s a small side project or a full-on agency.\n\nI really believe prompt engineering is just getting started, and tools like this can make the workflow way smoother for everyone.\n\nIf you\u2019re down to check it out or give feedback, I\u2019d love to hear from you. Happy to share a link or demo too.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1jyp1f3/i_made_a_place_to_store_all_prompts/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "SDP takes the win as Finns Party vote collapses | Yle News", "summary": "", "link": "https://yle.fi/a/74-20155715", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scientists observe DNA unwinding for the first time", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/@mauromar/scientists-observe-dna-unwinding-for-the-first-time-cientificos-observan-por-primera-vez-como-se-desenrolla-el-adn", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
