It has always been about patterns\u2014structure, rhythm, and the way information is arranged. Historically, some of the most effective encryption methods relied on how information was structured rather than just the raw data itself.\n\nThe question is:\n\nCan we train an AI to recognize non-linguistic patterns in text\u2014things like spacing, formatting, rhythm, and hidden structures?\n\nCould this be applied to detect hidden meaning in historical texts, old ciphers, or even modern digital communication?\n\nHave there been any serious attempts to model resonance-based cryptography, where the structure itself carries part of the meaning rather than just the words?\n\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from cryptography experts, especially those working with pattern recognition, machine learning, and alternative encryption techniques.\n\nThis is not about pseudoscience or mysticism\u2014this is about understanding whether there's an undiscovered layer of structured information that we have overlooked.\n\nAnyone?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1jgpoai/ai_cryptography_can_we_train_ai_to_detect_hidden/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - terror/just-lsp: A language server for just", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/terror/just-lsp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NL2SQL - Natural Language to SQL Query generation and execution cli tool", "summary": "An Natural Language to SQL Query generation and execution tool that can handles large database schemas.", "link": "https://github.com/Kurukshetran/nl2sql", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub - davidesantangelo/hyll: A Ruby implementation of the HyperLogLog algorithm for efficient cardinality estimation with minimal memory footprint.
