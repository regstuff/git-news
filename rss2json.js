The move marks the most serious crisis in transatlantic relations for decades.\n\nThe retaliation measures are being drawn up to give European leaders leverage in pivotal meetings with the US president at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, officials involved in the preparations said.\n\nThey are bidding to find a compromise that would avoid a deep rupture in the western military alliance, which would pose an existential threat to Europe\u2019s security.\n\nThe tariff list was prepared last year but suspended until February 6 to avoid a full-blown trade war. Its reactivation was discussed on Sunday by the EU\u2019s 27 ambassadors, along with the so-called anti-coercion instrument (ACI) that can limit the access of American companies to the internal market, as the bloc wrestled over how to respond to the US president\u2019s threat with punitive tariffs.\n\nTrump, who has demanded permission from Denmark to take control of Greenland, on Saturday evening vowed to impose 10 per cent tariffs by February 1 on goods from the UK, Norway and six EU countries that sent troops to the Arctic island for a military exercise this week.\n\n\u201cThere are clear retaliation instruments at hand if this continues\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009\\[Trump\u2019s\\] using pure mafioso methods,\u201d said a European diplomat briefed on the discussion. \u201cAt the same time we want to publicly call for calm and give him an opportunity to climb down the ladder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe messaging is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009carrot and stick,\u201d they added.\n\nFrance has called for the bloc to hit back with the ACI, which has never been used since its adoption in 2023. The tool includes investment restrictions and can throttle exports of services such as those provided by US Big Tech companies in the EU.\n\nParis and Berlin are coordinating a joint response, with their respective finance ministers due to meet in Berlin on Monday before travelling to Brussels for a gathering with their European counterparts, a French ministry aide said. \u201cThe issue will also have to be broached with all G7 partners under France\u2019s presidency,\u201d the person added. \n\nWhile many other EU member states have voiced support for exploring how the ACI could be deployed against the US, a majority called for dialogue with Trump before issuing direct threats of retaliation, diplomats briefed on the discussions told the FT.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the temperature down,\u201d said a second EU diplomat.\n\nIn a step towards retaliation, the biggest parties in the European parliament this weekend said they would delay a planned vote on measures that would have reduced EU tariffs on US goods as part of a trade agreement struck last year.\n\nTrump, who will be at the Swiss forum on Wednesday and Thursday, is set to hold private talks with European leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in addition to participating in a wider discussion among western countries supporting Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe want to co-operate, and it is not we who are seeking conflict,\u201d said Mette Frederiksen, Denmark\u2019s prime minister.\n\nNational security advisers from western countries will meet in Davos on Monday afternoon. The talks were initially set to focus on Ukraine and ongoing peace talks to end Russia\u2019s invasion of the country, but have been overhauled to give time to discuss the crisis over Greenland, two officials briefed on the preparations said.\n\nThe Swiss foreign ministry, which is hosting the gathering, said it \u201cwill not comment on participants or topics\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s threats \u201ccertainly warrant the ACI as it would be textbook coercion\u201d, said a third European official.\n\n\u201cBut we need to use the time to February 1st to see if Trump is interested in an off-ramp,\u201d they said, adding that much would depend on the outcome of the talks in Davos.\n\nEuropean officials said that they hoped their retaliation threats would increase bipartisan pressure in the US against Trump\u2019s actions and result in him retreating from his tariff pledge.\n\n\u201cIt is already a situation that no longer allows compromises, because we cannot hand over Greenland,\u201d said a fourth European official. \u201cThe reasonable Americans also know that he has just opened Pandora\u2019s Box.\u201d\n\nVon der Leyen said on Sunday that Europe would \u201cstand firm in our commitment to uphold the sovereignty of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark. We will always protect our strategic economic and security interests.\u201d\n\nBut on Sunday US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that Europe was too weak to guarantee Greenland\u2019s security and refused to back down on the US demand to take control of the strategically important island.\n\n\u201cThe president believes enhanced security is not possible without Greenland being part of the US,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\nEU leaders are preparing to meet for an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis on Thursday, according to an official briefed on the plans.\n\n\n\nEuropean Council president Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who convenes such summits, said on Sunday evening: \u201cGiven the significance of recent developments and in order to further co-ordinate, I have decided to convene an extraordinary meeting of the European Council in the coming days.\n\n\n\nThe EU was ready \u201cto defend ourselves against any form of coercion,\u201d Costa added.", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/b2872a49-3d43-4a55-a483-de7b19e8e436", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iranian official says verified deaths in Iran protests reaches at least 5,000", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iranian-official-says-verified-deaths-iran-protests-reaches-least-5000-2026-01-18/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan PM Takaichi calls snap election three months after taking office", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1dk0x0v6pdo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli attacks wound civilians across Gaza in latest ceasefire violations", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/18/israeli-attacks-wound-civilians-across-gaza-in-latest-ceasefire-violations", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Board of Peace for Gaza is forming with ambitions for a wider mandate of other conflicts", "summary": "####See also:\n\n* [$1 billion gets a permanent seat on Trump\u2019s Board of Peace for Gaza, as India and others invited](\n* [World leaders show caution on Trump's broader 'Board of Peace' amid fears for UN](\n* [Canada's Carney outlines \u2018precondition\u2019 to joining Trump\u2019s \u2018Board of Peace\u2019](\n* [Putin invited to join Trump\u2019s \u2018Board of Peace\u2019 for Gaza, Kremlin says ](\n* [Australian PM Albanese considers Trump\u2019s invitation to join Gaza \u2018board of peace\u2019 despite concerns body may undermine UN](\n* [Hungary\u2019s Orban Accepts Invitation to Trump\u2019s Gaza Peace Board](", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/trump-board-of-peace-gaza-un-b27d17190177041865c6827acd042e56", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran plans permanent break from global internet, say activists", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/17/iran-plans-permanent-break-from-global-internet-say-activists", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At least 21 killed in Spain after crash involving high-speed trains", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cedw6ylpynyo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mexican Forces Coordinate Arrests Of Plaza Bosses Of The Jalisco Cartel Across Five States", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.latintimes.com/mexican-forces-coordinate-arrests-plaza-bosses-jalisco-cartel-across-five-states-593587", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At least 5,000 dead in Iran unrest, official says, as judiciary hints at executions", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iranian-official-says-verified-deaths-iran-protests-reaches-least-5000-2026-01-18/?utm_source=reddit.com", "author": "None"}, {"title": "No sign of new protests erupting in Iranian cities", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraphherald.com/ap/national/article_2501dc4d-8a05-4759-98c5-ef653b545f58.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland\u2019s hits record power generation, passing 30 GW for first time, amid cold spell", "summary": "Poland has set a new record for electricity generation, passing 30 gigawatts (GW) for the first time, even as the country exported 2.3 GW of power. Around three quarters of the output came from fossil fuels, including almost 60% from coal.\n\nThe milestone came days after demand also hit a record 29.2 GW gross on 9 January, as temperatures in some regions dropped well below -10 degrees Celsius, sharply increasing heating and electricity use. The country also logged\u00a0[record gas consumption](\u00a0this month.\n\nEnergy minister Mi\u0142osz Motyka said the generation record showed the system could meet domestic demand while supporting neighbouring markets and maintaining what he described as a \u201csolid reserve\u201d.\n\nState operator Polish Power Grid (PSE) reported that total gross generation on 14 January reached 30.5 GW. After accounting for power used by plants themselves and auxiliary systems, net generation \u2013 a key metric \u2013 stood at 28.9 GW.\n\nCoal-fired plants supplied 59.9% of the output, gas contributed 13.9%, and renewables \u2013 including wind, solar and hydropower \u2013 made up 21.2%. PSE said net customer demand reached 26.6 GW that day, while electricity exports approached 2.3 GW.\n\nCompared with annual electricity production, the share of coal was slightly higher \u2013 Poland\u00a0[generated 52.2% of its electricity from coal in 2025]( by far the highest figure in the EU \u2013 while the share of gas was close to last year\u2019s annual figure of 13.2%.\n\nThe share of renewables was lower than 29.4% recoded last year,\u00a0mainly due to reduced solar output during a period of low sunlight.\n\nPSE told Notes from Poland that, more important than the generation peak, was the fact that the system operated smoothly despite record demand, with no threat of a blackout.\n\n\u201cIn the past, during severe freezes, we had to import electricity, and now we are becoming an energy exporter. This shows the stability of the system,\u201d said Aleksandra Dziadykiewicz from PSE\u2019s press office.\n\nThe energy minister echoed this sentiment. \u201cThis is proof of how our energy system operates stably and keeps up with growing needs \u2013 with a solid reserve,\u201d Motyka wrote on X.\n\nThe news comes days after the Polish government revealed that the country\u2019s power grid was\u00a0[the target of a major cyberattack](\u00a0at the end of December and came \u201cvery close to a blackout\u201d.

The results reveal the significant humanitarian, societal, and political impact of this economic tool on the general population.\n\nAccording to the study, from 2012-2019, when comparing the real Iran and the non-sanctioned \u201ctwin,\u201d researchers found that, were it not for sanctions, the Iranian middle class would have expanded by 17%.
