Back then, they hadn't mastered hydrogen bomb technology (correct me if I'm wrong). Due to the limited number of tests, it's widely believed that while India has crossed the nuclear threshold, their nuclear technology is quite outdated. Many think it's clearly inferior to North Korea's.\n\nHonestly, the current level of India's nuclear capabilities doesn't match its status or its aspirations. If India truly has ambitions, it should look for opportunities to conduct nuclear tests again.\n\nThe 2020s might be such a window of opportunity, for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Increased U.S. Tolerance:** With the U.S. feeling highly anxious, it might become more lenient towards India. In a few years, especially when China's nominal GDP surpasses that of the U.S., America might actually accept or even hope for a significant upgrade in India's nuclear capabilities.\n\n2. **Russian Support:** Russia might also secretly wish for India's nuclear capabilities to advance. Although I believe Russia aligning itself fully with the East is the right path, there are still many pro-European factions within Russia. They are currently forced into a tighter embrace with China due to external pressures but might somewhat desire a check on China's power.\n\n3. **Iran's Potential Breakthrough:** If Iran achieves a breakthrough in nuclear weapons in the 2020s, India would have even more justification for resuming its nuclear tests. And if Middle Eastern countries tacitly accept Iran's nuclear advancements, their resolve to jointly sanction India would weaken.\n\nConsidering these points, if India resumes nuclear testing within the next decade, China might find that several powerful global forces have adopted a de facto permissive attitude. If China imposes unilateral sanctions, it could become an outlier in diplomatic circles.\n\n4. **Modi's Leadership:** Modi seems likely to continue ruling, but he surely has to think about the 2030s and the transition of power. If the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wants to maintain long-term governance and effectively become a one-party state, a significant breakthrough in nuclear capabilities might be one of their strategies.\n\n5. **Pakistan's Decline:** This is the most crucial reason. Previously, India's restraint in conducting further nuclear tests was primarily due to Pakistan's counterbalance. In the late '90s, right after India's nuclear tests, Pakistan retaliated with tests of the same level. Since then, India realized that if they conducted nuclear tests, several major powers might secretly assist Pakistan in enhancing its nuclear capabilities. India didn't want to see this happen.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Pakistan's situation hasn't been great. Its economy is struggling, and its political landscape seems quite chaotic. There could come a time when the internal instability in Pakistan reaches a point where even several nuclear powers have significant reservations about assisting Pakistan in enhancing its nuclear capabilities. Under such circumstances, India's concerns would be considerably reduced.\n\nIn summary, this is a serious issue, and China should start considering and preparing early. There are some aspects that China can't change, like the first four reasons. It seems that focusing more on the factor of Pakistan is the key.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1d5prk4/the_possibility_of_india_resuming_nuclear_tests/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poll finds declining Canadian support for LGBTQ2 rights and visibility", "summary": "", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10538379/canada-lgbtq2-rights-poll/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenAI finds actors from Russia, China, Iran, and Israel attempting to use AI for propaganda", "summary": "1/ OpenAI released a report on partially state-sponsored actors from Russia, China, Iran, and Israel that are using AI models for covert online propaganda, but have so far achieved low reach and engagement.\r\n\r\n2/ The campaigns mix AI-generated content with traditional formats such as handwritten copy or copied memes.
