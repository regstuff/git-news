Great read!! \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nToday my client asked me about the significance of April Fool's Day, of which was actually a mystery to myself, so I googled it..\n\nI was extremely taken back to discover this cultural \"holiday\" celebrated by children, the elderly, people of all ages, is merely another facet of the government's manipulation.. More lies posed by the country's powerhouse to distract the masses, another aspect of the cynical \"holi-daze\" society partakes in every year ignorantly. \n\nThe true origin of April Fool's Day, the first day of April, dates back to the Middle Ages, specifically the 11th century, in Western Europe. \nThe Crusades, military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land, were fueling. War ran amuck in Europe, escalating towards the fall of the Western Roman Empire. \nDuring this time, 3 townsmen in Italy, sparked with revolutionary motives, had disguised themselves as knights of the king, in an effort of assassination, and snuck into the kingdom. \nHowever, these men were discovered, having no experience in military conduct or how to address the other authorities properly. Their facades were easily detected and the men were decapitated the next morning. \nThe king, in an effort to demonstrate his power among the people, left the \"fools'\" heads to sit on stakes outside the kingdom for the entire month of April..\n\nThis day, April first, was the day the men had attempted to \"fool\" the king, the day three men attempted to stand for their people in an act of valiant courage, resulting in tragic bloodshed and mockery, and then twisted by the Catholic Church, the Man behind the Curtain, Big Brother into disillusionment, an attempt to shroud the effort of man to revolt for the betterment of his people. \n\nPretty messed up right?\n Fortunately, this is all bullshit.\nApril Fools, you gullible sons o' beeches. For those who have read this far, thank you for your inquiry.. For those who didn't read this all the way through, they shall forever believe a terrible lie. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThe true origin of this day is unknown, but there is some talk of a calendar change in France.. Idk, pretty lame.\n Mine was better, I win.\n\n\n\n\nCredits- Danielle Nicole Marie Wheat Facebook ", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/share/2b8Z7G1db9kfdsGc/?mibextid=WC7FNe", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NLP Marketing Project", "summary": "Hi all, I'm a beginner in the NLP space and I was brainstorming a project that would connect brands to influencers.

For example a high score would be given to a beauty influencer and Ulta beauty but a low score would be given to a beauty influencer and DraftKings. \n\nHere are my questions: \n\n1) How would you analyze and condense the large influencer dataset? Would you get rid of the non-descriptive elements in the dataset or generate a list of words that describes the dataset?\n\n2) How would you compare the ethos of the brand to the influencer? More concretely, how would you compare the brand dataset to the influencer dataset and assign a value to how related the two datasets are to each other?
