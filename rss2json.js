I'm using hand-coded algorithms, not neural networks, etc., and as far as I know the jury is out on whether those newer approaches will even work for a language like ancient Greek, which is highly inflected, has extremely flexible word order, and has only a fairly small corpus available (at least for the classical language). Latin is probably similar. Others have worked on these languages, and there's a pretty nice selection of open-source tools for Latin, but when I investigated the possibilities for Greek they were all problematic in one way or another, hence my decision to roll my own.\n\nI would like to make a common API that could be used for both Latin and Greek, providing interfaces to other people's code on the Latin side. I've gotten a basic version of Latin analysis working by writing an interface to software called [Whitaker's Words]( but I have not yet crafted a consistent API that fits them both.\n\nHave any folks here worked with such systems in the past and formed opinions about what works well in such an API? Other systems I'm aware of include CLTK, Morpheus, and Collatinus for Latin and Greek, and NLTK for other languages.\n\nThere are a lot of things involved in tokenization that are hard to get right, and one thing I'm not sure about is how best to fit that into the API. I'm currently leaning toward having the API require its input to be tokenized in the format I'm using, but providing convenience functions for doing that.\n\nThe state of the art for Latin and Greek seems to be that nobody has ever successfully used context to improve the results. It's pretty common for an isolated word to have three or four possible part of speech analyses. If there are going to be future machine learning models that might be able to do better, then it would be nice if the API gave a convenient method for providing enough context. For now, I'm just using context to help determine whether a word is a capitalized proper noun.\n\nThanks in advance for any comments or suggestions. If there's an API that you've worked with and liked or disliked, that would be great to hear about.

Whenever i translate using DeepL API it for some reason throws away the formatting of the text, which makes it near impossible to import them back into the game. Even after using glossary it didnt change. Is there any other way to make sure it doesnt get rid of formatting? Or maybe other free software/service that can handle dialogues better?\n\n[ - Original Formatting\n\n[ - Formatting after translation\n\n[ - Glossary that i used  \n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1dnnyig/what_is_best_way_to_translate_dialogues/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy orders purge of Ukraine state guard after alleged assassination plots", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-claims-us-responsible-for-ukrainian-attack-on-crimean-peninsula", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Good news-NC GOP backs off on Bill that would have allowed destruction of archeological sites by developers.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.wral.com/story/in-major-reversal-nc-lawmakers-will-no-longer-push-bill-to-bulldoze-archeological-sites/21490311/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yet Another Way to Train Large Language Models", "summary": "Recently I found a new tool for training models, for those interested - [  \nThe solution is quite impressive, saving more GPU resources compared to FSDP, so if you want to save time and computing power, you may try it.
