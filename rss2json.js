What we have now is rules-based, and it works OK, but we believe we can make it better.\n\nSo far I've been testing out several BERT-based models for at least the NER side of things, such as a few fine-tuned Deberta V2 models and also gliner (which worked shockingly well). \n\nWhat I've found is that NER works decently enough, but the part that is missing I believe is how the entities relate to each other. For example, I can take any document and extract a list of names fairly easily, but where it becomes difficult is to match a name to an associated entity. That is, if a document only contains a name like \"John Smith\", that's considerable, but when you have \"John Smith had a cardiac arrest\", then it becomes significant. \n\nI think what I am looking for is a way to bridge the two things: NER and associations. This will be on strictly text, some of which has been OCR'd, but also text pulled from emails, spreadsheets, unstructured text, etc. Also I am not afraid of some manual labelling and fine-tuning if need be.

This results in the ratio between the generation and forward probabilities not being 1. However, if I essentially did two forward passes and two generation passes and subtracted the log probabilities of the two (ratio2 representing the forward log probs and ratio3 representing the forward log probs) which means the generations and forward processes are not sochastic. However, it is strange to see  that the forward process produces different probabilties than the generation process. I am also using the same model for both and the forward probabilities should match the generation probabilties and I am not sure why. \n\n\n\n    !pip install --upgrade pip\n    !pip install \"unsloth[cu121-torch240] @ git+\n    !pip install triton\n\n    \n    import argparse\n    \n    import torch\n    import transformers\n    from unsloth import FastLanguageModel\n    max_seq_length = 4096 # Choose any!
