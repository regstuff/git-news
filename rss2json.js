[Read blog](\n* Unsloth supports OpenEnv to allow for **open RL environments**. Blog coming soon \u2022 [Notebook](\n* New [customer support agent]( notebook to enable real-time analysis &amp; solving of customer interactions. You'll also learn how to train models using data from Google Sheets.\n* Support for **Python 3.13**, **PyTorch 2.9** and the latest Hugging Face TRL and transformers are now fixed.\n* Save to TorchAO supported as well:\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    from torchao.quantization import Int4WeightOnlyConfig\n    model.save_pretrained_torchao(\"model\", tokenizer, torchao_config = Int4WeightOnlyConfig())\n\n&gt;Update Unsloth via pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --no-deps unsloth unsloth_zoo If you want PyTorch 2.9: pip install --upgrade unsloth unsloth_zoo\n\n# RL Improvements\n\n1. Fixed [Standby]( consuming more VRAM than usual. Auto selects the maximum 80% to 95% of GPU utilization if import os; os.environ[\"UNSLOTH_VLLM_STANDBY\"] = \"1\" is used.\n2. Fixed GRPO training hangs with better environment timers - works on DGX Spark and all other GPUs.\n3. Fixes GRPO RuntimeError: shape '[1, 887, 1, 128]' is invalid for input of size 3633152 for all models\n\n# RL Environment functions\n\n* New execute\\_with\\_time\\_limit function to force functions to execute within a time limit. E.g. with a 2 second time limit, use:\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    from unsloth import execute_with_time_limit\n    @execute_with_time_limit(2)\n    def execute_strategy(strategy, game):\n        return _execute_strategy(strategy, game)\n    try:\n        execute_strategy(strategy, game)\n    except TimeoutError as e:\n        print(f\"Timed out with error = {str(e)}\")\n\n* To check if only Python standard modules are used in a function, use check_python_modules.\n* Use create_locked_down_function to create a function without leakage of global variables.\n* Use Benchmarker ie from unsloth import Benchmarker to benchmark functions accurately. It wipes the L1 to L3 cache approximately to reduce chances of benchmark cheating.\n* Use launch_openenv to launch a continuous reloaded OpenEnv environment process (to stop it from closing down) ie from unsloth import launch_openenv It will auto find a port that is not used.\n\n# Bug fixes\n\n1. GPT-OSS BF16 The GPTOSSRouter works with load_in_4bit = True AttributeError: 'GptOssTopKRouter' object has no attribute 'weight'\n2.
