It\u2019s built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, and works with both English and Chinese.\n\nMy use case:\n\nI tested it on several documents:\n\n1. A two-column academic paper with complex tables spanning both columns and multiple pages.\n\n2. A scanned form with handwritten entries and math equations.\n\n3. A multilingual report (English-Chinese) containing tables and figure references.\n\nWhat worked well:\n\n\\- Cross-page table merging was accurate. It managed to join table segments split across pages, and automatically remove duplicate table headers while merging the corresponding contents intact.\n\n\\- It handled merged cells and irregular table structures better than most tools I\u2019ve used, outputting clean HTML.\n\n\\- It preserved the placement of figures and labels, which is often dropped by simpler OCR systems.\n\n\\- It also retains the original font sizes across all heading levels, which makes the structure much clearer, and it smartly removes irrelevant stuff like footnotes or page numbers.\n\nCompared to olmOCR:\n\nI ran the same documents through olmOCR (also open-source), and found a few differences:\n\n\\- olmOCR struggled with merged cells and occasionally dropped columns entirely in complex tables.\n\n\\- It had no support for cross-page structures, which led to broken context.\n\nOCRflux gave significantly better results in terms of structure preservation and format coherence, although olmOCR was a bit lighter and faster in runtime.\n\nSome caveats:\n\n\\- OCRflux\u2019s output is Markdown + HTML, which is useful for downstream processing but may require cleanup for publishing. It\u2019s not the fastest option; processing heavier PDFs takes noticeable time.\n\n\\- LaTeX recognition works, but if you're parsing dense math docs, you\u2019ll probably still want to post-edit.\n\nI know as a new release, it's not perfect, but the direction is encouraging.
