My dataset consists of 110,000 records, and I trained for 10,000 steps with an evaluation every 500 steps. The model's task is to classify a given paragraph into one of the predefined categories provided in the prompt.\n\nTraining took around 60 hours on my current GPU (8GB VRAM). My training loss and evaluation loss are both around 0.07, which seems quite low. However, the actual performance of the model is disappointing\u2014it struggles to classify correctly.\n\nI have a few concerns and questions:\n\n1. Training Duration &amp; Steps: Most examples in Unsloth\u2019s documentation suggest much shorter training sessions. Is 10,000 steps too much for this type of task? Could I be overfitting?\n\n2. Evaluation Dataset: I noticed that Unsloth\u2019s fine-tuning examples don\u2019t explicitly mention an evaluation dataset. Should I be using one separately instead of relying on validation during training?\n\n3. Performance vs. Loss: Despite the low loss values, the model's output isn\u2019t great. Could this be a case of overfitting or some issue with my dataset?\n\n4. Hyperparameters &amp; Best Practices: Are there specific hyperparameters I should adjust for a classification task like this?\n\nAny guidance would be much appreciated!
