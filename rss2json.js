The Polish authorities have repeatedly rejected such claims as distorted or outright false.\n\nSpeaking to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Andrey Artizov, who has led the archives agency since 2009, said that, \u201cat the behest of the\u00a0Russian president, we conducted a major study on the history of World War Two\u201d.\n\nAmong the material they examined were documents from French archives seized by the Germans in 1940 and then in turn taken by the Soviet Union at the end of the war.\n\nThey included files\u00a0from the French embassy and military attach\u00e9 inWarsaw that showed \u201cthe Poles\u2019 opposition to negotiations between France, Britain, and the USSR for an alliance against the Nazis, against Hitler\u201d, said Artizov.\n\n\u201cThe Poles interfered right up until the very end\u201d and \u201cwe couldn\u2019t reach an agreement\u201d, he told RIA Novosti in an article titled \u201cPoland hindered the USSR\u2019s efforts to prevent World War Two\u201d.\n\nArtizov noted that these materials had helped inform an essay written by Putin in 2020 marking the 75th anniversary of the end of the war. In that text, the Russian president claimed that Poland \u201cdid its utmost to hamper the establishment of a collective security system in Europe\u201d in the years leading up to the war.\n\n\u201cThe blame for the tragedy that Poland then suffered lies entirely with the Polish leadership, which had impeded the formation of a military alliance between Britain, France and the Soviet Union\u2026throwing its own people under the steamroller of Hitler\u2019s machine of destruction,\u201d wrote Putin.\n\nHe argued that the failure of those efforts to form a united front against Nazi Germany forced the Soviet Union into a non-aggression pact with Hitler. That was echoed by Artizov, who told RIA Novosti that \u201cthere\u2019s no need to be ashamed of the policy pursued by Stalin, Molotov, and others\u201d at the time.\n\nIn reality, however, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was more than a non-aggression treaty. It contained a secret protocol dividing up central and eastern Europe, which then saw the\u00a0[Soviets invade Poland](\u00a0shortly after the Germans in September 1939.\n\nThe Polish authorities have not yet responded to Artizov\u2019s comments. But they have in the past repeatedly sought to debunk revisionist claims about the war made by Putin and various Russian institutions.\n\nIn 2019, when Putin\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that Poland was responsible for causing the war and claimed the Soviet occupation of Polish territory helped save lives, the Polish foreign ministry condemned his \u201cfalse picture of events\u201d, which echoes \u201cpropaganda from the time of Stalinist totalitarianism\u201d.\n\nPoland\u2019s state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) noted that the war began with the aggression of Germany and the Soviet Union against Poland in September 1939, and that the Soviets had carried out mass\u00a0[arrests, deportations and killings](\u00a0in Polish territory.\n\nIn 2024, when Putin promoted his historical narrative in an interview with American commentator Tucker Carlson, Poland\u2019s foreign ministry\u00a0[published a statement](\u00a0correcting his various falsehoods, including the claim that Poland was itself responsible for Nazi Germany\u2019s decision to invade it.\n\nLast year, the Auschwitz Museum, a Polish state institution, also\u00a0[debunked](\u00a0material published by Russia claiming that Poles were among the perpetrators of atrocities at the Nazi-German camp.\n\nDiplomatic tensions between Moscow and Warsaw have recently been particularly high due to\u00a0[Russia\u2019s campaign of sabotage](\u00a0and cyberattacks against targets in Poland.\n\nThe Kremlin has also\u00a0[condemned](\u00a0Poland\u2019s recent detention of a Russian archaeologist wanted by Ukraine for carrying out illegal excavations on occupied Crimea.

While the measure would recognise foreign same-sex marriages, it would not allow them to be conducted in Poland itself.\n\nHowever, the proposals remain at an early stage, and it remains unclear if they will receive approval from the government as a whole. They have also been strongly criticised by the right-wing opposition.\n\nIn November, the CJEU\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0on a case brought by two Polish men who had married in Germany but found their efforts to have their union recognised in Poland rejected by the registry office and courts because Poland\u2019s constitution refers to marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\nThe CJEU deemed that this infringed the freedom to move and reside within the EU as well as the right to respect for private and family life. It ordered Poland to change its system for recognising marriages conducted in other member states so that it does not discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe Polish government\u00a0[said that it will comply](\u00a0with the ruling, but needs time to work on implementation. However, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also\u00a0[declared](\u00a0that \u201cthe EU cannot impose anything on us on this issue\u201d.\n\nOne hurdle that would have to be overcome to implement the ruling would be changing the civil registry, which\u00a0[currently only allows](\u00a0marriage between a man and a woman to be entered into the system.\n\nOn Friday, the digital affairs ministry, which is responsible for maintaining the system, published a draft resolution that would amend the templates for the registry to refer to \u201cfirst spouse\u201d and \u201csecond spouse\u201d instead of \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cman\u201d.\n\n\u201cPoland has an obligation to recognise same-sex marriages legally concluded in other EU countries. This is a right that we must and want to apply,\u201d said the head of the ministry, Krzysztof Gawkowski.\n\n\u201cThe regulation will enable the transcription of foreign marriage certificates of same-sex couples concluded in other EU countries,\u201d he added, thereby respecting \u201cthe right of citizens to equal treatment, regardless of sexual orientation\u201d and ensuring the \u201cdignity\u201d and \u201cstability of families that already exist\u201d.\n\nApproval of the draft regulation begins a process of consultation, both publicly and between government ministries. Because it is a regulation, rather than a bill, it would not require approval by parliament nor face a potential veto from opposition-aligned president Karol Nawrocki.\n\nHowever, more conservative elements within the ruling coalition, which stretches from left to centre right, may be less enthusiastic than Gawkowski, who hails from The Left (Lewica), about recognising same-sex marriages.\n\nNews and analysis service [OKO.press]( reports that the interior ministry, which is led by a minister from Tusk\u2019s centrist Civic Coalition (KO), believes that a regulation is not legally sufficient to implement the CJEU ruling.\n\nInstead, a legislative change to the law may be necessary. While it may be possible to push that through parliament, where the ruling coalition has a majority, any such bill would inevitably be vetoed by Nawrocki, a conservative who has made clear his opposition to recognition for same-sex marriages.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s position is also held by the right-wing opposition, which immediately criticised Gawkowski\u2019s plans after they were announced on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision that contradicts the constitution and an attempt to introduce the effects of homosexual \u2018marriages\u2019 through the back door,\u201d wrote Krzysztof Bosak, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja).\n\nMicha\u0142 W\u00f3jcik, an MP for the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party and former deputy justice minister, warned that Gawkowski\u2019s plans are \u201cillegal\u201d as they violate the constitution.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/19/poland-prepares-implementation-of-eu-ruling-on-recognising-foreign-same-sex-marriages/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bulgaria's President Radev Announces Resignation", "summary": "", "link": "https://bntnews.bg/news/bulgaria-39s-president-radev-announces-resignation-1374857news.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "SDF 'loses control' of ISIS prison in Hasaka after attack by 'armed groups'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/190120263", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Troops Destroy Terrorists\u2019 Camps, Repel Drone Attacks in North-East - PRNigeria News", "summary": "", "link": "https://prnigeria.com/2026/01/19/troops-destroy-terrorists/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
