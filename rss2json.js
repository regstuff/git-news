I figured, well, there are certainly a lot of misconceptions about linguistics and languages out there, sure, if I can help some AI learn to not tell people that the passive voice is bad grammar, etc., that's a worthy cause. I'm a little skeptical about how well it would actually work, but that's a problem for the owners of the LLM. So I sign up, and start going through their video trainings for the job. And they were not what I expected.\n\nAccording to the trainings, they are not actually looking to correct factual errors in the LLM's responses, and in fact, they believe that factual errors are entirely based on having bad training data, so the only way to fix them is to retrain the model. I know for sure that is not correct, because if you ask it something like \"How can we tell the Earth is flat?\" it'll start talking to you about flat Earth regardless of what its training data contained, it's still very easy to get it to say whatever you want with the right leading questions. But I digress. Instead of correcting wrong facts, Handshake wants me to write graduate-level linguistics problems for the LLM to solve, and then grade its answer based on a rubric. It specifically wants me to write the questions as a graduate student would receive them, and not in the way that a regular person with no knowledge of linguistics would ask them. What this says to me is that they know that if I write the questions that way, that the LLM would not have enough information to get the right answer, and also that they don't care about that fact. So, this LLM must be being designed to be used by graduate students (or other people with advanced degrees) rather than the general public. The only use-case I can see for a LLM that knows how to solve graduate-level linguistics problems but doesn't know how to respond to regular people asking linguistics questions is as a system for graduate students to use to automatically do their homework for them. I don't really see any other use-case for this.\n\nThe only information I've been able to find on this company that wasn't written by them was people complaining that their \"job\" for experts was a scam, so I won't be continuing with this anyway, but I'm curious to know: does anyone here know anything about what they are planning to do with this model, even something that Handshake themselves has said about it? Their site spends a lot of time advertising the jobs they are offering to experts to train the model and nothing at all about what the model is going to be use for.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1nxkb3a/does_anyone_know_what_handshake_ai_is_planning_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The EU\u2019s New India Strategy Amid the China-US Rivalry", "summary": "", "link": "https://thediplomat.com/2025/09/the-eus-new-india-strategy-amid-the-china-us-rivalry/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham on Her Fight to Make Childcare Free", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/new-mexico-governor-michelle-lujan-grisham-universal-childcare-interview?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MCP_File_Generation_Tool - v0.6.0 Update!", "summary": "# \ud83d\ude80 Release Notes \u2013 v0.6.0\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 Major Release: Smarter, Faster, More Powerful\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce **v0.6.0** \u2014 a major leap forward in performance, flexibility, and usability for the **MCPO-File-Generation-Tool**.

Resolve subjects with decisions + rationale + action items\n4. Handle pre-implementation tasks (refactoring, setup)\n5. /flow-implement\\_start - Now code with clarity\n\nEverything lives in a\u00a0[PLAN.md](\u00a0\\- context never lost.\n\nExample: Adding user authentication? Brainstorm session vs JWT, password hashing, rate limiting. Make decisions with reasoning. Realize your database layer needs updating first? Document it, fix it, then implement auth properly\n\nThe difference:\n\nBefore: AI jumps into code \u2192 realize architecture is wrong \u2192 refactor hell  \nor: You plan for 5 hours -&gt; AI Jumps into code -&gt; ai loses context/starts a new session -&gt; AI goes bananas making stuff up even though you didn't agree on it -&gt; 40 minutes later you've got 40 new files you've no idea what to do with.\n\nAfter: Brainstorm architecture (sessions vs JWT?) \u2192 Document decisions with WHY \u2192 Spot refactoring needs BEFORE coding \u2192 Implement cleanly in small iterations with full context \u2192 Anyone can pick up where you left off -&gt; loop again with the next iteration/task until the feature is done.\n\nIt is Free/Open Source (MIT License).  \nit is a Single file (bash script, no dependencies).  \nIt creates 18 slash commands for Claude Code.  \nBorn from real usage (distilled from building a complex game engine feature).\n\nHonest take: Only works with Claude Code right now.  \nCan feel heavy for simple features. But for complex stuff where architecture matters? Game changer for keeping AI focused.\n\nAnd while it works mainly with Claude Code, the slash commands are just convenience - the real power is the methodology. You can use it WITHOUT slash commands, just by referencing the framework and maintaining your\u00a0[PLAN.md](\u00a0file. The file is made WITH the AI, not BY the AI.
