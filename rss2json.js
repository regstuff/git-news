If the perpetrator is found to have done so \u201cin order to gain financial or personal benefit\u201d, they would face an even tougher sentence of between one and ten years.\n\nThe bill also includes prison sentences of up to five years for officials who \u201cpersistently question the validity of the constitution or statutes regulating the system of courts and the procedure for appointing a judge, or refuse to apply them\u201d, or who seek to assess the legality of the appointment of a judge.\n\nHowever, the draft law adds that an official would not be guilty of any of the above offences if they were \u201cacting within the scope of their constitutional or statutory powers\u201d.\n\nThe proposed measures are aimed at ending Poland\u2019s current \u201cdual\u201d legal system, where certain judges and their rulings are recognised by one side but not by the other.\n\nThe situation stems from PiS\u2019s overhaul of the KRS in 2017. Previously, most of its members had been chosen by judges themselves; after PiS\u2019s reform, most were chosen by politicians.\n\nA number of\u00a0[Polish](\u00a0and\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings have found that PiS\u2019s actions rendered the KRS illegitimate, because it was no longer independent. That in turn called into question the validity of the 3,000 or so judges appointed through the KRS since then, and the hundreds of thousands of rulings issued by them.\n\nThe current government, which replaced PiS in office in 2023, has sought to resolve the situation by restoring the KRS to its former status and\u00a0[annulling many of the judicial appointments](\u00a0made through it since 2017. However, those measures are opposed by Nawrocki, who has the power to veto them.\n\nThe president\u2019s new proposals would seek to criminalise and jail those who question the validity of post-2017 judges and institutions staffed by them. For example, around 60% of current judges on the Supreme Court were appointed through the KRS after it was overhauled by PiS.\n\nMeanwhile, the current government also\u00a0[does not recognise](\u00a0the legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal because some of its judges (who are not nominated by the KRS) were\u00a0[appointed unlawfully](\u00a0by the PiS-era parliament and former PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda.\n\nAnother element of Nawrocki\u2019s bill would remove from the profession any judge who\u00a0[refused to sit on a bench with illegitimately appointed judges](\u00a0or challenges the rulings of such judges, as has often happened.\n\nGiven that it is Poland\u2019s president who ultimately appoints judges to courts after they are recommended by the KRS or parliament, both Duda and Nawrocki have criticised dissenting judges and political opponents who have questioned the legal status of judicial appointments made by them.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s proposal was immediately condemned by justice minister Waldmar \u017burek. He said that the bill was even more punitive than the\u00a0[disciplinary measures for dissenting judges introduced under PiS]( which was nicknamed the \u201cmuzzle law\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a muzzle, it\u2019s a leash for Polish judges,\u201d said \u017burek, who was himself a judge who\u00a0[faced disciplinary action](\u00a0under the PiS government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intended to punish judges who apply EU rulings and rulings of legitimate Supreme Court judges,\u201d he added, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). \u201cThis is unprecedented. It would take us back to the legal Middle Ages. If we tried to pass this bill, we\u2019d have to leave the EU.\u201d\n\nDeputy justice minister Dariusz Mazur said that Nawrocki\u2019s bill aimed to introduce \u201cabsolute, autocratic power over the justice system\u201d and \u201cput judges under his boot\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, after the president\u2019s bill was submitted to parliament, the speaker of the lower-house Sejm, W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, condemned the proposal, which he said \u201cviolates judicial independence and the separation of powers\u201d.\n\nGiven that the government has a majority in parliament, there is no chance the president\u2019s bill will be passed during the current term, which runs until the next parliamentary election, due in autumn 2027.\n\nHowever, the measures are a signal of intent of what Nawrocki could seek to do if a government formed from the current right-wing opposition parties wins power in that election.\n\nWhen announcing the bill on Thursday, Nawrocki said that, if the government \u201crejects dialogue\u201d on the issue, he would seek to call a national referendum on his proposals and \u201clet the citizens decide\u201d. However, the president can only call a referendum with the approval of parliament.\n\n[**Daniel Tilles**](\n\nDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0*Notes from Poland*.

It frequently comprises soup followed by a meat-based main dish, with fish or flour-based food, such as pancakes or\u00a0[pierogi]( being common on Fridays.\n\nBut the current rules regulating such meals in schools, introduced in 2016, are now set for a shakeup under a\u00a0[decree](\u00a0issued by the health ministry following a series of consultations. It will affect more than 6.8 million pupils in almost 36,000 public schools and preschools (although not all children eat school lunches).\n\nFrom 1 September, meat should be served only twice weekly and fish at least once. In each case, for people who do not consume animal products, an alternative plant-based dish, particularly based on legumes (such as beans, chickpeas or lentils) should be offered.\n\nFurthermore, a legume-based dish \u201cwithout the addition of animal-based products\u201d should be served for\u00a0*obiad*\u00a0to all pupils at least once a week.\n\nThe decree also limits the number of fried dishes per week to two, instructs schools to prepare soup using vegetable broth (Polish soups often use a meat base) at least twice a week, and restricts the amounts of sugars, fat and salt in products that can be served to pupils.\n\nLunches should provide pupils with between 20% (for a main course) and 30% (for two courses) of their daily energy requirements, based on their age group. Further criteria are specified for institutions serving additional meals beyond\u00a0*obiad*, such as preschools.\n\nThe new rules represent a significant change in Polish schools, where pupils and parents often complain about a lack of healthy as well as non-meat options.\n\nAccording to a report for Green REV Institute, a pressure group, almost 79% of meals served in schools in the Masovian province, where Warsaw is situated, are meat-based, while just 2.5% of schools offer plant-based meals and only 0.28% offer a complete vegan diet.\n\nThe initial version of the decree, drawn up last year, also included a proposal to ban the sale of coffee in schools.\n\nHowever, that was abandoned after claims that it would be harmful to the vending machine industry and would not prevent students from buying coffee outside school, reports TVN24.\n\nBut health minister Jolanta Sobiera\u0144ska-Grenda told Radio ZET that the ministry would renew efforts to prohibit the sale of coffee in schools.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely not in favour of caffeine consumption taking place in schools,\u201d she said, stressing that children\u2019s health was more important than the views of lobbyists.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/20/polish-government-introduces-healthier-food-and-vegan-options-in-school-canteens/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mexican security forces reportedly kill drug cartel boss \u2018El Mencho\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/22/mexican-security-forces-reportedly-kill-drug-cartel-boss-el-mencho", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Slovakia threatens to cut electricity to Ukraine over Russian oil spat", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2026/2/21/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-to-ukraine-over-russian-oil-spat", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
