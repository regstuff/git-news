First, they canceled my flight on June 3rd without offering any reimbursement. I had to pay for a hotel and rent a car out of my own pocket. Then, they made me pay for another flight because I was stranded in Houston, needing to travel from Houston to Roatan and then back to Orlando. I ended up spending a total of $7,000 on the entire trip. United is one of the worst airlines I've ever used. They even changed my family\u2019s seats, placing my 3-year-old daughter by herself. A child that young can't sit alone! To top it off, they misplaced my wife's suitcase, which we didn\u2019t get until the next day. What made it even more disappointing was that they could have canceled the flight while we were still in Orlando, but instead, they waited until we were in Houston, leaving us with no choice but to pay for the additional costs since we were stuck.\"\u00a0In this random review, we can clearly see that Passanger is dealing with a flight cancellation problem, so I have to tag the problem with a relative tag and respond accordingly. There can also be multiple tags, e.g., if passanger is complaining about food quality and seating discomfort.\u00a0Tags can be:\n\n* Staff behavior (rude, unhelpful, unprofessional)\n* Food quality (bad, cold, limited options)\n* Seat comfort (uncomfortable, cramped, or broken)\n* Flight delays/cancellations\n* Baggage issues (lost, delayed, or damaged)\n* Hidden fees\n* Customer service (unresponsive, unhelpful)\n* Cleanliness of the aircraft\n* In-flight entertainment (not working, limited options)\n* Boarding process (disorganized, slow)\n\nIs there any LLM model for this or any methodology so that I can achieve the same?

SEPs measure the \"semantic entropy\" from AI responses, with high entropy indicating potential hallucinations.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 The new technique solves the problem of high computational cost when measuring semantic entropy. Instead of using multiple model responses per query like an older method, SEPs employ trained linear probes to predict uncertainty from a single response.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc49 SEPs work across different model architectures and layers, with middle to late layers capturing semantic entropy most effectively. While not quite reaching the performance of more computationally intensive methods, SEPs offer a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for practical use. In the future, performance is expected to be further improved through larger training datasets.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1dz8tfr/researchers_develop_lowcost_method_to_detect_ai/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Plan to rename Milan airport after Berlusconi sparks outrage in Italy ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/09/plan-to-rename-milan-airport-after-berlusconi-sparks-outrage-in-italy", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jared Leto invests in AI startup Captions for simple video creation and digital avatars", "summary": "Captions, an AI startup that simplifies video creation and editing, has secured $60 million in a new funding round led by Index Ventures.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1dz7tzn/jared_leto_invests_in_ai_startup_captions_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Women should receive 'fuller recognition' in the Catholic Church, Vatican says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-10/women-should-receive-fuller-recognition-in-catholic-church/104082374", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Paris mayor vows to swim in River Seine next week despite pollution concerns ahead of Olympics", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Paris mayor vows to swim in River Seine next week despite pollution concerns ahead of Olympics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMTAvc3BvcnQvcGFyaXMtbWF5b3Itc3dpbS1yaXZlci1zZWluZS1vbHltcGljcy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNy8xMC9zcG9ydC9wYXJpcy1tYXlvci1zd2ltLXJpdmVyLXNlaW5lLW9seW1waWNzLXNwdC1pbnRs?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-10", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beaten in Wimbledon quarterfinals by Daniil Medvedev after needing medical assessment in third set", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beaten in Wimbledon quarterfinals by Daniil Medvedev after needing medical assessment in third set</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMDkvc3BvcnQvamFubmlrLXNpbm5lci13aW1ibGVkb24tcXVhcnRlcmZpbmFscy1kYW5paWwtbWVkdmVkZXYtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDcvMDkvc3BvcnQvamFubmlrLXNpbm5lci13aW1ibGVkb24tcXVhcnRlcmZpbmFscy1kYW5paWwtbWVkdmVkZXYtc3B0LWludGw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lamine Yamal: Spain beats France to reach Euro 2024 final after historic goal from 16-year-old", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Lamine Yamal: Spain beats France to reach Euro 2024 final after historic goal from 16-year-old</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMDkvc3BvcnQvc3BhaW4tZnJhbmNlLWV1cm8tMjAyNC1zZW1pZmluYWwtbGFtaW5lLXlhbWFsLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAV9odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA3LzA5L3Nwb3J0L3NwYWluLWZyYW5jZS1ldXJvLTIwMjQtc2VtaWZpbmFsLWxhbWluZS15YW1hbC1zcHQtaW50bA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "US star Emma Navarro\u2019s Wimbledon run ended by Italy\u2019s Jasmine Paolini", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">US star Emma Navarro\u2019s Wimbledon run ended by Italy\u2019s Jasmine Paolini</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMDkvc3BvcnQvZW1tYS1uYXZhcnJvLXdpbWJsZWRvbi1xdWFydGVyZmluYWxzLWphc21pbmUtcGFvbGluaS1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNy8wOS9zcG9ydC9lbW1hLW5hdmFycm8td2ltYmxlZG9uLXF1YXJ0ZXJmaW5hbHMtamFzbWluZS1wYW9saW5pLXNwdC1pbnRs?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "MLB player Wander Franco formally charged with sexual and commercial exploitation of a minor in the Dominican Republic", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">MLB player Wander Franco formally charged with sexual and commercial exploitation of a minor in the Dominican Republic</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDcvMTAvc3BvcnQvd2FuZGVyLWZyYW5jby1tbGItY2hhcmdlZC1zZXh1YWwtZXhwbG9pdGF0aW9uLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-07-10", "author": "None"}]}}};
