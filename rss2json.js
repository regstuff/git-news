He called the IPC\u2019s decision \u201cscandalous\u201d and the result of Russian lobbying.\n\nIn 2022, Russia and Belarus were banned from the Beijing Paralympics, which began shortly after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The following year, the measures were softened to allow the two countries\u2019 para-athletes to compete as \u201cneutrals\u201d, meaning without national symbols such as flags and anthems.\n\nLast year, Russia and Belarus regained full membership rights in the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), after a vote by the organisation\u2019s member states to lift their partial suspensions.\n\nThat decision, which was jointly condemned by Poland and 32 other countries, opened the way for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under national flags.\n\nFinally, on Tuesday this week, the IPC announced that it had now granted permission for six Russian and four Belarusian para-athletes to take part in the upcoming games in Italy, which will take place from 6 to 15 March, under their national colours.\n\nThe decision was immediately condemned by Ukraine, whose foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, declared that \u201callowing the flags of aggressor states to be raised at the Paralympic Games while Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine rages on is wrong \u2014 morally and politically\u201d.\n\nHe said that Ukraine would urge other countries to boycott the opening ceremony of the games.\n\nThe EU\u2019s commissioner for sport, Glenn Micallef, announced on Wednesday that he would not attend the opening ceremony, saying that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Russian national symbols to appear while the country\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine continues.\n\nMeanwhile, Estonia\u2019s public broadcaster, ERR, has said it will not show events in which the Russian and Belarusian athletes are competing.\n\nPoland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s closest allies since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.
