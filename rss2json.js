We are looking for a way to translate all of this so we have everything that\u2019s being said available in the edit.\n\nWe already tried Premiere Pro\u2019s built in transcription tool but we cannot rely on it because of the following factors:\n\n* it is spoken in Russian and Ukrainian and it seems to not have enough training data to always know what is going on (+ the Ukrainian was not transcripted and translated in Premiere Pro because it doesn\u2019t support it)\n* multiple people speak at the same time\n* voices are unclear or far away\n* sentences/words are being made up in silences\n* etc.\n\nNow I was wondering if there is another way of doing this using some kind or multiple AI tools, or if we just need a bunch of people to transcript/translate all of this/other ways of dealing with this.\n\nLooking forward to any tips or ideas.

Following insightful feedback from the Reddit community, we've identified the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach as a promising direction.\n\nOur next step involves creating a model that can be trained on a comprehensive database encompassing the textual and visual aspects of landscape architecture\u2014such as design visions, imagery, and design language. We are particularly interested in understanding the most effective way to establish a\u00a0**community-driven platform**\u00a0where landscape architecture firms and independent professionals can collaboratively train the model.\n\nWe are not looking for a full-length step-by-step guide, but we would be extremely grateful if anyone could share some best practices, examples, or even mention some systems or platforms that we could explore further on our own.\n\nSpecifically, we seek guidance on how to design a user-friendly database that allows multiple contributors to easily input their data independently. Our goal is to ensure a low barrier to entry, encouraging widespread participation across the field.\n\nHopefully we can build a collective view on this,\n\nBest,\n\nSimon", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1f81al7/seeking_advice_on_building_a_communityled/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Introducing Baatchit (Mern Chat ): An Open-Source, Real-Time, End-to-End Encrypted Chat Application \ud83c\udf1f", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/RishiBakshii/mern-chat-end-to-end-encrypted", "author": "None"}, {"title": "North Texas school district offering free child care", "summary": "", "link": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2024/09/03/north-texas-school-district-offering-free-child-care-", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More than 50 killed in Russian missile strike on Ukrainian military facility", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-missile-strike-ukraine-poltava-zelenskyy-rcna169288", "author": "None"}, {"title": "World Bank halts paid advertising on X after CBS News finds its promoted ad under racist content", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/world-bank-advertising-elon-musk-x-racism-pro-nazi-accounts/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France Confronts Horror of Rape and Drugging Case as 51 Men Go on Trial", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/europe/france-husband-rape-drug-trial-mazan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.IE4.tV-C.LLueLeAoOhmB", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Boy who accidentally broke 3,500-year-old jar welcomed back to museum ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/style/israel-haifa-museum-boy-broken-jar-returns-intl-hnk/index.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
