Thanks so much for making Unsloth, which is a fantastic tool. I use it for startup work and academic work, and increasingly often when I talk to ML engineers from industry they use it too.\n\n  \nI was trying to run Unsloth today in Google Colab but unfortunately there seems to be a dependency problem. When I run the Colab example here: [\n\nI get this error:\n\n    WARNING:xformers:WARNING[XFORMERS]: xFormers can't load C++/CUDA extensions. xFormers was built for:\n        PyTorch 2.3.0+cu121 with CUDA 1201 (you have 2.4.1+cu121)\n        Python  3.10.14 (you have 3.10.12)\n      Please reinstall xformers (see )\n      Memory-efficient attention, SwiGLU, sparse and more won't be available.\n      Set XFORMERS_MORE_DETAILS=1 for more details\n    \n\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n\n    OSError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)\n    \n\n     in _register_extensions()\n        127     try:\n    --&gt; 128         torch.ops.load_library(ext_specs.origin)\n        129     except OSError as exc:\n    \n    /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/xformers/_cpp_lib.py\n\n    WARNING:xformers:WARNING[XFORMERS]: xFormers can't load C++/CUDA extensions. xFormers was built for:\n        PyTorch 2.3.0+cu121 with CUDA 1201 (you have 2.4.1+cu121)\n        Python  3.10.14 (you have 3.10.12)\n      Please reinstall xformers (see )\n      Memory-efficient attention, SwiGLU, sparse and more won't be available.\n      Set XFORMERS_MORE_DETAILS=1 for more details\n    \n\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n\n    OSError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)\n    \n\n     in _register_extensions()\n        127     try:\n    --&gt; 128         torch.ops.load_library(ext_specs.origin)\n        129     except OSError as exc:\n    \n    /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/xformers/_cpp_lib.py\n\n8 frames\n\n    OSError: /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/xformers/_C.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3c1010Dispatcher17runRecordFunctionERN2at14RecordFunctionESt17reference_wrapperIKNS_14FunctionSchemaEENS_11DispatchKeyE\n    \n\n    The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\n    \n    \n\n    xFormersInvalidLibException               Traceback (most recent call last)\n    \n\n    xFormersInvalidLibException: xFormers can't load C++/CUDA extensions. xFormers was built for:\n        PyTorch 2.3.0+cu121 with CUDA 1201 (you have 2.4.1+cu121)\n        Python  3.10.14 (you have 3.10.12)\n      Please reinstall xformers (see )\n      Memory-efficient attention, SwiGLU, sparse and more won't be available.\n    \n\n    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n    \n    \n\n    ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)\n    \n\n     in &lt;module&gt;\n        257     _register_extensions() # Check if C++ modules are loaded correctly\n        258 except Exception as error:\n    --&gt; 259     raise ImportError(\n        260         \"Unsloth: Xformers was not installed correctly.\\n\"\\\n        261         \"Please install xformers separately first.\\n\"\\\n    \n    /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/unsloth/models/_utils.py\n\n    ImportError: Unsloth: Xformers was not installed correctly.\n    Please install xformers separately first.\n    Then confirm if it's correctly installed by running:\n    python -m xformers.info\n    \n    Longer error message:\n    xFormers can't load C++/CUDA extensions. xFormers was built for:\n        PyTorch 2.3.0+cu121 with CUDA 1201 (you have 2.4.1+cu121)\n        Python  3.10.14 (you have 3.10.12)\n      Please reinstall xformers (see )\n      Memory-efficient attention, SwiGLU, sparse and more won't be available.\n\nI would really appreciate any assistance in updating the dependencies!

Extracting certain types of entities requires some contextual understanding of the method, which is something that LLMs would excel at. However, even using larger models like Llama3.1-70B on Groq still leads to slow inference overall. For example, I have used the Llama3.1-70B and the Llama3.2-11B models on Groq for NER. To account for errors in logic, I have had the models read the papers one page at a time, and used chain of thought and self-consistency prompting to improve performance. They do well, but total inference time can take several minutes. This can make the use of GPTs prohibitive since I hope to extract entities from several hundreds of publications. Does anyone have any advice for methods that would be faster, and also less error-prone, so that methods like self-consistency are not necessary?\n\nOther issues that I have realized with the Groq models:\n\nThe Groq models have context sizes of only 8K tokens, which can make summarization of publications difficult. For this reason, I am looking at other options. My hardware is not the best, so using the 70B parameter model is difficult.\n\n  \nAlso, while tools like SpaCy are great for some entity types of NER as mentioned in this list [here]( I'm aware that my entity types are not within this list. \n\nIf anyone has any recommendations for LLM models on Huggingface or otherwise for NER, or any other recommendations for tools that can extract specific types of entities, I would greatly appreciate it!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1g552zp/current_advice_for_ner_using_llms/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rift with Canada slams brakes on India's Stryker armoured vehicle deal: Report", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/rift-with-canada-slams-brakes-on-india-s-stryker-armoured-vehicle-deal-report/ar-AA1spDAd?ocid=msedgntp&amp;pc=DCTS&amp;cvid=f571ab757d2148f1a9d589bda51821b0&amp;ei=27", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'Trooper' the dog will be adopted, after being found tied to post in floodwaters ahead of Hurricane Milton.

This is not related to identifying cyberbullying and the corpus is not from social media. I have 5000 labelled interactions, 1500 are labelled as harassment. My approach is as follows:  \n\n* Create a balanced dataset, 1500 labelled harassment and 1500 labelled as not harassment. \n* Test 3 LLM's selected based on breadth (e.g bidirectional context), depth of existing training and popularity (usage) in current related research. \n* For each LLM, I propose to run three tests. This setup allows for a fair comparison between human and LLM performance based on difference levels of context and training.\n* The three separate tests are:\u00a0\n\n1. Zero-shot prompting:\u00a0\n   * Provide the LLM with the dataset to annotate with a simple prompt to label each interaction as contains or does not contain\n   * This tests the baseline knowledge and how well the LLM performs with no instructions\n2. Context/Instruction prompting:\u00a0\n   * Provide the LLM with the same one-page instruction document given to human annotators\u00a0\n   * Use this as a prompt for the LLM to annotate the test set\u00a0\n   * This tests how well the LLM performs with the same examples provided to the humans\u00a0\n3. Training:\u00a0\n   1. Use a 80% training set to train the LLM\u00a0\n   2. Then use the trained model to annotate the remaining 20% test set\u00a0\n   3. This tests whether fine-tuning on domain-specific data improves LLM performance\u00a0\n\nWould greatly appreciate feedback.
