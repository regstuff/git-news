However, the court\u2019s decision now opens the way for prosecutors to issue domestic and European arrest warrants for the suspect.\n\nZiobro is\u00a0[accused](\u00a0of committing a variety of crimes, including leading a criminal group, abusing his powers and approving the unlawful purchase of Pegasus spyware, when he served as justice minister in the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government from 2015 to 2023.\n\nIf found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison. However, Ziobro denies the offences and claims to be a victim of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d against him by the current government, a coalition ranging from left to centre right led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nIn October, the government\u2019s majority in parliament\u00a0[approved the lifting of Ziobro\u2019s immunity](\u00a0from prosecution. However, he had by then already travelled to Hungary, whose ruling Fidesz party and Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n are allies of PiS.\n\nOn Thursday, a district court in Warsaw finally ruled on prosecutors\u2019 request to place Ziobro in pretrial detention. The hearing had previously twice been delayed after Ziobro\u2019s attorneys raised objections.\n\n\u201cThe court fully agreed with the arguments set out in the motion, finding that there was a general statutory basis for applying preventive measures \\[of pretrial detention\\], namely a high probability that the suspect committed the alleged acts,\u201d prosecutor Piotr Wo\u017aniak told journalists on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe next step will be to launch a search for the suspect using a domestic arrest warrant and a European Arrest Warrant,\u201d he added. He\u00a0[said](\u00a0the domestic warrant would likely be issued on Friday, while the request for an EAW is expected to be submitted to the district court early next week.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision was also welcomed by interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski, who wrote on social media that it was \u201ca symbol of the fight against evil, political corruption and the pathology of power\u201d. He added that the ruling also opens the way for an Interpol red notice to be issued for Ziobro.\n\nHowever, Bartosz Lewandowski, a lawyer representing Ziobro, said that they would file an appeal against the court\u2019s decision and would in the meantime apply for enforcement of the decision to be suspended pending that appeal.\n\nZiobro himself told conservative broadcaster Republika that he had \u201cexpected this decision because I see what is happening in Poland\u201d. He has previously claimed that the government has weaponised the legal system against him and that he will only\u00a0[return to face justice when the rule of law is restored](\n\nThe Hungarian authorities have endorsed those claims, granting Ziobro asylum in December on the basis that he was facing political persecution in Poland. They previously also granted asylum to one of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy ministers,\u00a0[Marcin Romanowski]( who has also fled criminal charges in Poland.\n\nGiven that Ziobro has asylum, it is unlikely that Hungary would currently comply with an EAW, just as they have refused to hand over Romanowski. However, that situation could change if Orb\u00e1n loses power in April\u2019s parliamentary elections.\n\nCommenting on Thursday\u2019s ruling, another of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy ministers, Micha\u0142 W\u00f3jcik, said that ti shows \u201cwe live under a regime\u201d in Poland and that there would only be an independent judiciary once the current government is removed from power.\n\nTusk\u2019s government has made it one of its priorities to hold to account former PiS officials for alleged crimes.
