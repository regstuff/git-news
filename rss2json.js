Found something that changes everything.\n\n**The discovery:**\u00a0ChatGPT has a hidden \"reasoning mode\" that most people never trigger. When you activate it, response quality jumps dramatically.\n\n**How I found this:**\n\nBeen testing thousands of prompts and noticed some responses were suspiciously better than others. Same model, same settings, but completely different thinking depth.\n\nAfter analysing the pattern, I found the trigger.\n\n**The secret pattern:**\n\nChatGPT performs significantly better when you force it to \"show its work\" BEFORE giving the final answer. But not just any reasoning -\u00a0**structured reasoning**.\n\n**The magic prompt structure:**\n\n    Before answering, work through this step-by-step:\n    \n    1. UNDERSTAND: What is the core question being asked?\n    2. ANALYZE: What are the key factors/components involved?\n    3. REASON: What logical connections can I make?\n    4. SYNTHESIZE: How do these elements combine?\n    5. CONCLUDE: What is the most accurate/helpful response?\n    \n    Now answer: [YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION]\n    \n\n**Example comparison:**\n\n**Normal prompt:**\u00a0\"Explain why my startup idea might fail\"\n\n**Response:**\u00a0Generic risks like \"market competition, funding challenges, poor timing...\"\n\n**With reasoning pattern:**\n\n    Before answering, work through this step-by-step:\n    1. UNDERSTAND: What is the core question being asked?\n    2. ANALYZE: What are the key factors/components involved?\n    3. REASON: What logical connections can I make?\n    4. SYNTHESIZE: How do these elements combine?\n    5. CONCLUDE: What is the most accurate/helpful response?\n    \n    Now answer: Explain why my startup idea (AI-powered meal planning for busy professionals) might fail\n    \n\n**Response:**\u00a0Detailed analysis of market saturation, user acquisition costs for AI apps, specific competition (MyFitnessPal, Yuka), customer behavior patterns, monetization challenges for subscription models, etc.\n\n**The difference is insane.**\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nWhen you force ChatGPT to structure its thinking, it activates deeper processing layers. Instead of pattern-matching to generic responses, it actually reasons through your specific situation.\n\n**I tested this on 50 different types of questions:**\n\n* Business strategy: 89% more specific insights\n* Technical problems: 76% more accurate solutions\n* Creative tasks: 67% more original ideas\n* Learning topics: 83% clearer explanations\n\n**Three more examples that blew my mind:**\n\n**1. Investment advice:**\n\n* Normal: \"Diversify, research companies, think long-term\"\n* With pattern: Specific analysis of current market conditions, sector recommendations, risk tolerance calculations\n\n**2. Debugging code:**\n\n* Normal: \"Check syntax, add console.logs, review logic\"\n* With pattern: Step-by-step code flow analysis, specific error patterns, targeted debugging approach\n\n**3. Relationship advice:**\n\n* Normal: \"Communicate openly, set boundaries, seek counselling\"\n* With pattern: Detailed analysis of interaction patterns, specific communication strategies, timeline recommendations\n\n**The kicker:**\u00a0This works because it mimics how ChatGPT was actually trained. The reasoning pattern matches its internal architecture.\n\n**Try this with your next 3 prompts and prepare to be shocked.**\n\n**Pro tip:**\u00a0You can customise the 5 steps for different domains:\n\n* For creative tasks: UNDERSTAND \u2192 EXPLORE \u2192 CONNECT \u2192 CREATE \u2192 REFINE\n* For analysis: DEFINE \u2192 EXAMINE \u2192 COMPARE \u2192 EVALUATE \u2192 CONCLUDE\n* For problem-solving: CLARIFY \u2192 DECOMPOSE \u2192 GENERATE \u2192 ASSESS \u2192 RECOMMEND\n\n**What's the most complex question you've been struggling with?

Say DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, even the new GPT-OSS model does not have Vision. For all OpenWebUI users using these models as daily drivers, and the people who use external APIs like OpenRouter, Groq, and Sambanova, I present to you the most seamingless way to add vision capabilities to your favorite base model.\n\nHere it is: [External Vision Layer Function](\n\nNote: even VLMs are supported.\n\n# Features:\n\n1. This filter implements an asynchronous image-to-text transcriber system using Google's Gemini API (v1beta).\n   * You are permitted to modify code to utilize different models.\n2. Supports both single and batch image processing.\n   * Meaning one or multiple images per query will be batched as one request\n3. Includes a retry mechanism, per-image caching to avoid redundant processing.\n   * Cached images are entirely skipped from further analysis to Gemini.\n4. Images are fetched via aiohttp, encoded in base64, and submitted to Gemini\u2019s generate_content endpoint using inline_data.\n5. Generated content from VLM (in this case Gemini) will replace the image URL as context for non-vlm base model.\n   * VLM base model also works because the base model will not even see the images, completely stripped from chat.\n   * API's such as OpenRouter, Groq, and Sambanova API models are tested to function.\n6. The base model knows the order the images were sent, and will receive the images in this format:\n\nxml\n&lt;image 1&gt;[detailed transcription of first image]&lt;/image&gt;\n&lt;image 2&gt;[detailed transcription of second image]&lt;/image&gt;\n&lt;image 3&gt;[detailed transcription of third image]&lt;/image&gt;\n\n\n7. Currently hardcoded to limit max 3 images sent per query.

As the chart shows, back in 1984, one in three Dutch people believed homosexuality was \u201cnever or rarely justified\u201d. In Spain and Great Britain, that view was held by the majority. Perhaps most strikingly, three-quarters of Americans thought the same.\n\n&gt;Since then, levels of discrimination have plummeted. Today, the share of people in these countries who think that homosexuality is \u201cnever or rarely justified\u201d makes up a shrinking minority.

Second, it is customizable. Customizable, meaning that you can add your favorite MCP servers so you can access their functionality during meetings. In addition, you can also easily change the agent\u2019s system prompt. The meeting assistant also comes with real-time transcription.\n\nA bit more on the technical side: We built a joinly MCP server that enables AI agents to interact in meetings, providing them tools like speak\\_text, write\\_chat\\_message, and leave\\_meeting and as a resource, the meeting transcript. We connected a sample joinly agent as the MCP client. But you can also connect your own agent to our joinly MCP server to make it meeting-ready.\n\nYou can run everything locally using Whisper (STT), Kokoro (TTS), and OLLaMA (LLM). But it is all provider-agnostic, meaning you can also use external APIs like Deepgram for STT, ElevenLabs for TTS, and OpenAI as LLM.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re currently using the slogan: \u201cAgentic Meeting Assistant beyond note-taking.\u201d But we\u2019re wondering: Do you have better ideas for a slogan?
