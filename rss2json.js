My understand was that OpenWebUI basically tells Ollama \"hey use this model with these settings to answer this prompt\" and streams the response. \n\nI am asking because right now I'm hosting OWUI on a raspberry pi 5 and Ollama on my desktop PC. My intuitition told me that performance would be identical since Ollama, not OWUI runs the LLMs, but now I'm wondering if I'm throwing away performance. In case it matters, I am *not* running the Docker version of Ollama.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1l5shc7/why_would_openwebui_affect_the_performance_of/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Outrage after Republican representative disparages Sikh prayer in the US House | Republicans | The Guardian", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/us-house-prayer-republican-mary-miller", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The one who is now considered the mother of modern paleontology in life was never recognized as the brilliant scientist she was because she was a woman, self-taught and from humble beginnings", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/history/@newsfocus/the-one-who-is-now-considered-the-mother-of-modern-paleontology-in-life-was-never-recognized-as-the-brilliant-scientist-she-was-", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Web search functions doesn't seem to work for me (using Deepseek-R1 and Gemma-3)", "summary": "I enabled open webui's web search function using Google PSE.\n\nUsing either engine mentioned, with web search enabled, I prompt the chatbot to tell which teams are in the NBA finals in 2025.\n\nThe prompt does show some website that are searched but the context from these websites doesn't seem to be taken into account.\n\nWith Deepseek, it just says their data cutoff is in 2023.\n\nWith Gemma, it will says these are the likely teams (Boston and OKC...lol).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1l60y3u/web_search_functions_doesnt_seem_to_work_for_me/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "France opens \u2018complicity in genocide\u2019 probes against French-Israelis over blocked Gaza aid", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/france-opens-complicity-in-genocide-probes-over-blocked-gaza-aid/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Copy This Prompt and Watch ChatGPT Expose Your Useless Skills for the Future", "summary": "Act as an AI strategy expert from the year 2030.\nAnalyze my current plan or skills, and tell me with brutal honesty: \u2013 What skills, habits, or systems will be worthless or obsolete in the next five years? \u2013 What must I start building or learning right now, so I won\u2019t regret it by 2030?
