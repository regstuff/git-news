How are you dealing with it?", "summary": "This is the #1 technical challenge we face running voice AI agents on real phone calls, and I haven\u2019t seen a satisfying solution anywhere.\n \nIn a real phone conversation, people interrupt constantly. They say \u201cmm-hmm\u201d while you\u2019re talking. They start their answer before you finish the question. They cough. Background noise triggers false positives on voice activity detection.\n \nWhat we\u2019ve tried and the results:\n \n\u2022 Simple VAD threshold: If we detect speech while the agent is talking, stop and listen. Problem: too sensitive = agent stops every time someone breathes. Too insensitive = agent talks over the user. We\u2019ve tuned this endlessly and there\u2019s no perfect setting.\n\u2022 Energy-based filtering: Ignore \u201cinterruptions\u201d below a certain energy/volume threshold. Works okay for background noise but fails for soft-spoken users and quiet \u201cmm-hmm\u201d acknowledgments.\n\u2022 Semantic interrupt detection: Run a quick classifier on the partial transcript to determine if the interruption is meaningful (\u201cwait, actually\u201d) vs backchannel (\u201cmm-hmm\u201d, \u201cokay\u201d). This is the best approach but adds latency and still has ~15% error rate in our testing.\n\u2022 Platform-level handling: ElevenLabs has built-in interruption handling that\u2019s decent but not configurable enough. Sometimes we want the agent to keep talking through a backchannel and sometimes we want it to stop immediately.\n \nThe second unsolved problem: silence. When the user goes silent for 5+ seconds, what should the agent do? We currently have a timer that triggers a \u201cAre you still there?\u201d or repeats the last question. But in some cases the person is just thinking, and the prompt feels pushy.\n \nAnyone cracked the interruption handling problem in production? Specifically interested in: custom VAD models trained on phone-quality audio, approaches to backchannel detection, and how you handle the \u201csilence ambiguity\u201d (thinking vs disconnected vs confused). Also curious if anyone has tried using the LLM itself to decide whether to yield the floor or keep talking.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1ral2xz/handling_interruptions_in_voice_ai_is_an_unsolved/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The high price of regime change in Cuba", "summary": "Cuba has long been the prize in the Trump administration\u2019s Western Hemisphere policy. \n\nState Secretary Rubio and other administration officials have also recognized that \u201cthe road to Havana runs through Caracas,\u201d meaning the administration needed to address Venezuela before turning to Cuba.\n\nNow, the moment appears to have arrived.\nIn the wake of former Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s ouster, Venezuela has halted free oil shipments to Cuba, further squeezing the island\u2019s economy. U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening secondary tariffs on any country that works to help Cuba, so no clear replacement is on the horizon.

Almost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland today, and the government argues that it is time to normalise their status.\n\nAnnouncing his signature on the bill, Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition and regularly clashes with the more liberal ruling coalition, claimed credit for pushing the government towards ending the \u201cunconditional privileges\u201d granted to Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently stood by Ukraine in its fight against imperial Russia,\u201d said the president. \u201cIn the first months of the war, Poland passed the test of solidarity like no other country.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what was justified at the time of difficulty, over time began to breed a sense of inequality towards Polish citizens,\u201d he continued. \u201cI promised to end the era of unconditional privileges. Today, I am fulfilling this commitment.\u201d\n\nThe previous\u00a0[special act](\u00a0on Ukrainian refugees simplified rules on residence, work, benefits and education. However, the government said last month that it now wants to introduced a \u201csingle, coherent support system for all foreigners covered by temporary protection in the EU, regardless of citizenship\u201d.\n\nThe new law, which comes into force on 5 March, extends the legal stay of people fleeing the war and Ukrainian citizens whose residence permits were prolonged because of the conflict, allowing them to apply for legal residence until 4 March 2027.\n\nUnder the new rules, Ukrainian refugees without healthcare insurance will be treated the same as uninsured Polish citizens. There are exceptions for children, pregnant women, victims of violence, and wounded soldiers.\n\nAdditionally, special measures put in place to help Ukrainian children adapt to Polish schools \u2013 such as Polish language classes, preparatory courses and simplified rules for hiring intercultural assistants \u2013 will be removed at the end of the current academic year.\n\nMeanwhile, the provision of accommodation and food will be restricted to particularly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.\n\nThe current right of Ukrainians to establish a business under special rules \u2013 i.e. the same conditions applicable to Polish citizens \u2013 will also be terminated.\n\nThose seeking temporary protection will be required to register for a Polish personal identification number (PESEL) within 30 days of entry. Failure to register will be treated as an implied waiver of temporary protection.\n\nSpeaking after signing the bill on Thursday, Nawrocki said that the new measures mean continued support for Ukrainians but an end to \u201cprivileges at the expense of Poles\u201d.\n\n\u201cAssistance must be coupled with responsibility and contribution to our community,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe are creating fair rules for those who want to work here, while also protecting the Polish labour market and the state budget.\u201d\n\nLast August, shortly after taking office, Nawrocki\u00a0[vetoed](\u00a0an attempt by the government to extend support for Ukrainian refugees on the previous terms.

However, in that year, the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government changed the system so that most members were chosen by politicians.\n\nThe move was widely condemned by expert bodies as undermining judicial independence.\u00a0[Polish](\u00a0and\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings have found the KRS to no longer be a legitimate body due to it now being under political influence.\n\nThe current, more liberal government, which replaced PiS in 2023, has pledged to restore the legitimacy of the KRS by again having most members elected by judges. However, a\u00a0[previous attempt](\u00a0to do so was blocked in 2024 by then-President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally.\n\nLast November, justice minister Waldemar \u017burek\u00a0[launched another effort](\u00a0to reform the KRS, which he said was an attempt at \u201ccompromise\u201d as it took into account some of Duda\u2019s concerns but still restored the right of judges to elect most KRS members in direct and secret elections\n\nThe legislation was approved by parliament in January. However, Duda\u2019s successor, Nawrocki, who is also aligned with PiS, has now decided to veto it.\n\nAmong the concerns expressed by Nawrocki\u2019s office are that the law would have ended the role of parliament, which is \u201ca representative of the sovereign, of all Poles\u201d, in choosing members of the KRS.\n\nThe president\u2019s chancellery also said that the proposed law \u201craises serious constitutional and systemic concerns\u201d, including by specifying that KRS candidates have at least ten years of judicial experience and five years in their current position. This \u201carbitrarily excludes a significant group of judges from running\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Nawrocki argued that one element of the legislation would have resulted in doubts over the\u00a0[legal status of around 3,000 judges](\u00a0previously appointed by the KRS and all the rulings issued by them, therefore creating \u201cimmense legal chaos\u201d.\n\nHowever, the government\u2019s spokesman, Adam Sz\u0142apka, responded to Nawrocki\u2019s veto by saying that signing the bill would have been a way \u201cto end the chaos in the courts\u201d caused by PiS\u2019s reforms, which rendered many institutions and appointments illegitimate.\n\nHaving long anticipated Nawrocki\u2019s veto, the ruling coalition does, however, have a \u201cplan B\u201d, which it\u00a0[set in motion last week]( when the speaker of parliament began the process of selecting new members of the KRS for when its current term expires in May.\n\nGiven that the PiS-era law giving parliament the right to choose KRS members remains in place, the ruling coalition plans to use its parliamentary majority to choose candidates democratically nominated by judges themselves.\n\nSince coming to office last August, Nawrocki has vetoed government bills at an\u00a0[unprecedented rate]( Last week, he vetoed bills on\u00a0[regulating crypto-asset markets](\u00a0and\u00a0[recognising Silesian as a regional language](\n\nAlongside today\u2019s veto of the KRS bill, the president also vetoed another bill that the government said was intended to support farmers.\n\nThe president, however, claimed it was \u201ca bad law hiding behind a pretty name\u201d and would in fact have favoured large entities while drowning smaller family farmers in bureaucracy.
