When Ctrl+Enter is enabled, you can freely use Enter to add new lines within your prompt \u2014 perfect for writing structured, multi-line inputs without accidentally submitting too soon. to submit, quick access to saved content, and more\n\u00b7 Import/Export your pinned prompts and categories (merge or replace)\n\u00b7 Arabic language support\nNone of that existed in a clean, easy way \u2014 so I rolled up my sleeves and built it. Took a lot of time, testing, and fine-tuning... but I'm super proud of how it turned out.\nIf you use ChatGPT regularly and want to streamline your experience, please give it a try.
