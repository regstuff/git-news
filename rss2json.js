Each model is profiled for cost and quality across benchmark tasks.\n2. Prompts are embedded and clustered by complexity and domain.\n3. The router picks the model minimizing expected error plus cost.\n4. New models are automatically benchmarked and added on the fly.\n\nNo manual evals, no retraining, no static routing logic.\n\n# Example use\n\n* Lightweight requests \u2192 gemini-flash tier models\n* Reasoning or debugging \u2192 claude-sonnet class models\n* Multi-step reasoning \u2192 gpt-5-level models\n\nAdaptive decides automatically in milliseconds.\n\n# Why it matters\n\nMost production LLM systems still hardcode model choices or run manual eval pipelines that don\u2019t scale.  \nAdaptive replaces that with live routing based on actual model behavior, letting you plug in new models instantly and optimize for cost in real time.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nAdaptive is a real-time router for multi-model LLM systems.  \nIt learns from live evals, adapts to new models automatically, and cuts inference costs by up to **90%** with almost no latency.\n\n**Drop it into your stack and stop picking models manually.**", "link": "https://github.com/Egham-7/adaptive", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenWebUI+Litellm+Anthropic models via API = autorouting to lesser Claude models", "summary": "This in interesting.\n\nUsing Anthropic models in OpenWebUI, through LiteLLM cluster (with many other models).\n\nToday I configured Haiku 4.5 to be available to users of the OpenWebUI service and asked for model version and cut off date.\n\nCheck the answer.  It says it is Claude 3.5 sonnet.\n\n\n\nIn LiteLLM the logs shows it asked for the correct model.\n\n\n\nAnd in Anthropic API console I see the logs also stating it is Haiku 4.5:\n\n\n\nBut the answer from the API says it is 3.5 sonnet.\n\nTried same thing with Sonnet 4.5 in openwebui, which passed though LiteLLM to Anthropic API:\n\n\n\nIt appear also in API console in anthropic as Claude Sonnet 4.5\n\n\n\nNow check its response:\n\nI'm Claude 3.5 Sonnet (version 2), and my knowledge cutoff date is April 2024.\n\nSo,  I'm going crazy, or is Anthropic routing to less capable models the API calls we pay for????  Maybe first checking if prompt is not that complex to answer and routing it to an older, lesser, cheaper to run model... but anyway, without us knowing, and telling plain lies it in the actual logs.\n\nHas anyone seen this behaviour before?\n\nMaybe this auto routing is what all people have been crying out about Claude behaving quite worse since the summer.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1o8xjzc/openwebuilitellmanthropic_models_via_api/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "4chan faces UK ban after refusing to pay \u2018stupid\u2019 fine", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/4chan-ban-uk-fine-online-safety-act-b2845043.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Exploring LLM Inferencing, looking for solid reading and practical resources", "summary": "", "link": "/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o8wi46/exploring_llm_inferencing_looking_for_solid/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "U.S. support for Argentina could hit $40 billion", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-support-argentina-hit-40-billion-rcna237852", "author": "None"}, {"title": "At the age of 90 Maryette McFarland just graduated from the Open University and has been receiving job offers!
