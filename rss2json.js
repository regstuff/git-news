Can we get a specific scope/ruleset defined for this sub to help differentiate us from all of the LLM-focused &amp; Linguistics subreddits?", "summary": "Hey folks!\n\nI've been active in this sub for the past few years, and I feel that the recent buzz with LLMs has really thrown a wrench in the scoping of this sub. Historically, this was a great sub for getting a good mixture of practical NLP Python advise and integrating it with concepts in linguistics. Right now, it feels like this sub is a bit undecided in the scope and more focused on removing LLM-article spam than anything else. Legitimate activity seems to have declined significantly.\n\nTo help articulate my point, I listed a bunch of NLP-oriented subreddits and their respective scopes:\n\n* r/LocalLLaMA - This subreddit is the forefront of open source LLM technology, and it centers around Meta's LLaMA framework. This community covers the most technical aspects to LLMs and includes model development &amp; hardware in its scope.\n* r/RAG - This is a sub dedicated purely to practical use of LLM technology through Retrieval Augmented Generation. It likely has 0% involvement with training new LLM models, which is incredibly expensive. There is much less hardware addressed here - instead, there is a focus on cloud deployment via AWS/Azure/GCP.\n* r/compling - Where LanguageTechnology focused more on practical applications of NLP, the compling sub tended to skew more academic (academic professional advice, schools, and papers). Application questions seem to be much more grounded in linguistics rather than solving a practical problem.\n* r/MachineLearning - This sub is a much more broad application of ML, which includes NLP, Computer Vision, and general data science.\n* r/NLP - We dislike this sub because they were the first to take the subreddit name of a legitimate technology and use it for a psuedoscience (Neuro linguistic processing) - included just for completeness.\n\nIn my head, this subreddit has always complemented r/compling - where that sub is academic-oriented, this sub has historically focused on practical applications &amp; using Python to implement specific algorithms/methodologies. LLM and transformer based models certainly have a home here, but I've found that the posts regarding training an LLM from scratch or architecting a RAG pipeline on AWS seem to be a bit outside the scope of what was traditionally explored here.\n\nI don't mean to call out the mod here, but they're stretched too thin. They moderate well over 10 communities and their last post here was done to take the community private in protest of Reddit a year ago &amp; I don't think they've posted anywhere in the past year.\n\n**My request is that we get a clear scope defined &amp; work with the other NLP communities to make an affiliate list that redirects users.**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fy98we/the_future_of_rlanguagetechnology_can_we_get_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thousands of police officers specially trained to investigate rape", "summary": "", "link": "https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/uknews/2024/05/17/thousands-of-police-officers-specially-trained-to-investigate-rape/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Need Help in Building System for Tender Compliance Analysis using LLM", "summary": "Context: An organization in finance domain issues guidelines for early payment programs in public sector tenders.

For context, I've always wanted to do archaeology but was scared to do it at undergrad as I was frequently told there was no money within this field from friends and family and often faced disapproval for even bringing it up. \n\nNow finishing undergrad I am ready to take the leap to try and transition into the field after realising i may regret it if i don't pursue it. However, i have some questions:\n\n&gt; I am unsure on how to go about it? I've heard from some people to volunteer and try for a masters, however I have no idea how to look for dig sites looking for volunteers. \n\n&gt;How hard is the transition from geography, to doing a msc in archaeology after not having done it at undergrad?\n\n&gt; is it possible for me to do this or am I too late?\n\nAny advice, experiences and resources would help greatly.\ud83d\ude4f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1fylbao/wanting_to_transition_from_a_bsc_geography_degree/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russia on \u2018mission to cause mayhem\u2019 on British streets, warns MI5 head", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8e15yr1gwo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Qualcomm's AI Orchestrator aims to bring personalized AI assistants to your devices", "summary": "1/ Qualcomm introduces the \"AI Orchestrator\", a software that mediates between personal data, apps, and AI models on devices.\r\n\r\n2/ The software uses a personal knowledge graph to better understand the user's context and provide personalized answers.\r\n\r\n3/ The AI orchestrator supports various forms of input such as text, images, and voice and can even understand and use the capabilities of installed apps.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1fyciyr/qualcomms_ai_orchestrator_aims_to_bring/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Post-Classic/Spanish Conquest Maya PhD programs?", "summary": "So, I'm a Classical Civilizations and Archaeology undergrad about to graduate this Spring and I've been on track to study Imperial Roman archaeology, but I just had to take a Maya class as an elective and now I've caught the bug. I was wondering a) if my Classics background would hinder grad school applications and b) if there are any good funded late Maya PhD programs. Ideally, I'd like something on the Spanish Conquest or 16th/17th century.
