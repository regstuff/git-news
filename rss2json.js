Despite its simple approach, the performance is quite good.\n\nKey Features\n\n* Focused on CPU execution: Use efficient models like deepset/tinyroberta-6l-768d for embedding generation.\n* Cosine Similarity Classification: Instead of fine-tuning, classify texts using cosine similarity between class embedding centroids and text embeddings.\n* Efficient Multi-Classifier Execution: Run multiple classifiers without extra overhead when using the same model for embeddings.\n* Easy Export and Loading with HuggingFace: Models can be easily exported to and loaded from HuggingFace. Unlike with fine-tuning, only one model for embeddings needs to be loaded in memory to serve any number of classifiers.\n\n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1d9g5fa/lightningfast_text_classification_with_llm/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Three boys out for a hike discovered a T. rex fossil", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/three-boys-discovered-teenage-t-194318588.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ex-Russian soldier accused of planning France terror attack", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/06/05/ukrainian-russian-man-paris-terror-attack-suspect-biden/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "looking to hire some computational linguist", "summary": "I am looking to hire a few computational linguist ( french and italian ) and I am wondering where should I look for them.
