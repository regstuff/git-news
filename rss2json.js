At the very end, Charles is the only other character to sink last with Jack and Rose, all after emptying his bottle in one gulp. One last one for \u201cthe road\u201d, as they say.\n\nAt the time of the wreck, Charles must have been 34 years old. He was a habitu\u00e9 of the bottle, known for his love of alcohol. By the time the alarm sounded, the pastry chef already had a glass in his nose. A ringing bell brought him back to reality. Time to evacuate? On the contrary, he\u2019s immediately sent to the bakery to prepare bread. Yes, yes, as the Titanic begins its inexorable descent into the depths of the Atlantic, Charles races like mad to make the life-saving buns.\n\nOnce his mission was accomplished, Charles made his way to the bridge, where the evacuation took place in total chaos. The lifeboats were loaded in disarray, the men were impatient, access to third class was denied, and some refused to believe that the ship was going to sink: they simply didn\u2019t want to board the lifeboats.\n\nCharles, who had been promised a place, begins to lose patience. He is asked to come back later. While he waits, we can imagine him taking a sip or two, tipsy, stamping his feet as he watches poor women panic in front of the lifeboats. [Charles ]( said to have grabbed women and children \u2013 like loaves of bread \u2013 and thrown them into the little lifeboats. Hup! In this way, Charles \u201csaved\u201d perhaps a dozen people.\n\nBut when it was his turn to evacuate, he was told that his place had been given to three men. Charles found himself trapped on the ship, alone with his bottle. Resigned, he climbs to the top floor and starts throwing chairs overboard, objects that will help some of the survivors to stay alive.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, our heroic pastry chef survived the cataclysm! An hour and 40 minutes after the ship sank, the first lifeboat approached the last point of contact with the Titanic, now swallowed by the ocean. Charles is found asleep on a piece of wreckage. His hair isn\u2019t even\u00a0[wet]( At this point, you can die of hypothermia in less than ten minutes.
