After months of optimization and experimentation, I managed to reduce battery consumption to **0.02% per minute**, translating to **over 83 hours of runtime**.\n\nWhen I started, the models consumed **0.41% battery per minute**, providing only about 4 hours of runtime, and the phone got uncomfortably hot very quickly. It\u2019s been a journey of debugging, crashes, and hard lessons, but the results have been worth it.\n\nHere are some of the key things I learned along the way:\n\n# Optimizations and Techniques\n\n# 1. Reducing Model Size Without Sacrificing Accuracy\n\nThe initial wake word detection models were too large and inefficient. By optimizing the models and tailoring them for my specific use case, I reduced their size while keeping accuracy rates high. These models now handle multiple **wake words** (like \"Voice commands,\" \"Wake words,\" and **custom hot words**) in parallel.\n\n# 2. I had to compile my own Custom AI Libraries (Instead of Standard Ones) - this was the hardest tasks of all.\n\nI didn\u2019t use the standard AI libraries of TensorFlow Lite and ONNX Runtime. Instead, I compiled these libraries with extended code and added relevant libraries such as **Qualcomm QNN libraries** with cross-compilers.  \nThe goal was to utilize as much hardware acceleration as possible and drastically reduce power consumption.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t easy:\n\n* **Challenging Crash debugging**: When it crash, it is really hard to understand why. perhaps the specific HW is missing, you did not really add the library as you thought you did etc'\n* **Cross-compilation and especially linking issues**: Aligning library compatibility with Android\u2019s toolchain was challenging.\n\n**3. The pain was worth it and the Results is an Efficient Parallel Wake Word Detection**\n\nDetecting multiple wake words simultaneously. Balancing resource usage very well while managing constant audio buffers and model inference. Now it can be used not just for \"hot word\" however for \"Voice to Intent\" and \"Phrase Recognition\".\n\n# Takeaways for Other Developers\n\nFor anyone working on similar problems, here\u2019s what worked for me:\n\n1. **Optimize You Models**:\n2. **Use Hardware-Specific Libraries**: For example below is how to build onnx with Qualcomm QNN\n\n# [\n\n1. **Do Not give up - Iterate and Debug**: Expect issues when working with custom AI libraries and cross-compilers. Be patient\u2014it\u2019s worth the effort.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested do download the \"wake word\" / \"hot word\" inference on Android: here is the links:\n\n* [Wake word detection GitHub repository](\n* [Wake word]( npm package](\n\nPlease note that is it React-Native however easy to extract Android Native only from it.\n\nHope this helps someone :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1i8occ0/achieving_002_battery_consumption_for_multi_wake/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Have you observed better multi-label classification results with ModernBERT?", "summary": "I've had success in the past with BERT and with the release of ModernBert I have substituted the new version.
