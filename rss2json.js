Modern technology such as telephones was making it easier to track the movements of outlaws on the run and Butch was beginning to feel the pressure and considered going to South America. The cattle industry was big in Argentina so he decided to pull another robbery to finance the venture.\n\nThe gang included Butch Cassidy, Harry Longabaugh, aka the Sundance Kid and Will \u201cNews\u201d Carver. Carver earned his nickname because he devoured newspaper stories heralding the daring exploits of the Wild Bunch.\n\nThey chose the bank in Winnemucca, Nevada. The boys camped near town for about ten days prior to the heist, casing the town and the bank. On the morning of the raid, September 19th, 1900 they headed for town.  They stopped briefly to cut through a barbed wire fence to take a shortcut through a field. Carver dismounted, took his wire cutters and cut the wires. Then, he spotted a large skunk. He pulled his pistol, fired and missed. While the rest of the gang laughed and cheered him on, he took off chasing the stripped polecat. Now, it was the skunk\u2019s turn to fire his weapon and he didn\u2019t miss.\n\nWhen Carver returned and approached his horse the animal shied away, not wanting any part of him. After several unsuccessful attempts he managed to swing into the saddle, however Butch and Sundance, holding their noses, made him ride in the rear.\n\nThe bank robbery went off smooth but as one Pinkerton agent later wrote, \u201cCarver could hardly stand the smell himself. The clerks kept sniffing and at one point he muttered, \u2018Dammit, I can\u2019t help it. He got me first.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe robbery netted the gang some $32,000 and only took about five minutes but on the way out Carver accidently dropped a small bag of gold and stopped to pick it up, His horse picked up the smell and once again Carver and his horse had a small rodeo. A passerby grabbed a shot gun and fired off a blast but only succeeded in shooting out both windows of the saloon next door.\n\nThe first thing Carver asked when he reached the next town was where he could get a bath and some fresh clothes. It was said that afterwards he still smelled like a skunk. All in all News Carver was having a bad day.\n\nThe three bank robbers took the loot and headed for Fort Worth where met up with Ben Kilpatrick and Harvey Logan aka Kid Curry.  They bought themselves some expensive suits, silk shirts, and new boots then headed for Fanny Porter\u2019s bordello for some frolicking and a little R &amp; R with Fannie\u2019s good time girls.\n\nThe next day Butch, Sundance, Will Carver, Ben Kilpatrick and Harvey Logan posed brazenly for a local photographer in their new duds. The photographer liked the picture so well he put it in the window of his shop, where a passing lawman recognized one of the outlaws. The photos were copied on \u201cwanted\u201d posters and plastered all over the West.

The language is designed to prevent common security issues automatically and uses password-less user authentication. All user data is stored and encrypted locally before syncing, which helps maintain user privacy and data security.\n\nHere,  is a demo application built with Plang to show its practical application and ease of use.

My article was published only because it was such a contrarian view (to the prevailing view that India must also join China's BRI).  \nMy view was that China's business model for the BRI (belt and road initiative) involved influencing one or a handful of decision makers in the country, to take decisions that would benefit them and not the country, in order to access loans which other lending agencies would not agree to. The projects financed by the CPEC have been ruinous for Pakistan - either unnecessary, or too expensive. It has contributed in part to the serious foreign exchange crisis Pakistan faced later. \n\nLast Oct, Fawad Hassan, the Pak minister who was the minister in charge of the CPEC and who was spared imprisonment on condition that he does not belittle the army (who championed the CPEC) or the CPEC itself, made a serious criticism of the CPEC - something that people knew but either did not want to admit, or made excuses like Covid, to justify delays in projects. Its a very candid admission of   \nwhat has gone wrong - though he was the minister in charge at the time.   \nIn the last 6 months, despite the change in govt, sidelining the minister, there have been no press reports in favor of the CPEC and China has also tacitly started putting projects on cold storage.  \n[\n\nIt's an example of what is going wrong with China funded projects across countries, across the BRI.\n\n ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1c2u8w2/pakistans_cpec_delusion_revisited/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Situation in east Ukraine has \u2018deteriorated significantly,\u2019 Kyiv commander says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/east-ukraine-front-russia-war-oleksandr-syrskyi/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A 605 MW PV plant in Germany is now Europe's largest solar farm", "summary": "", "link": "https://electrek.co/2024/04/12/germany-europe-largest-solar-farm/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A prehistoric henge has been accidentally discovered near Crowland Abbey in eastern England", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/prehistoric-henge-accidentally-discovered-in-england-in-search-for-anglo-saxon-hermit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bondi Junction shooting, stabbing live updates: Multiple people dead after shooting, stabbing in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/bondi-junction-shooting-stabbings-live-updates-police-operation-in-sydney-s-eastern-suburbs-20240413-p5fjku.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Swedish Right-wing political party 'Sweden Democrats' call for \"declaration of war\" on gangs after father shot dead in front of 12 year old son", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.rmx.news/crime/swedish-nationalists-call-for-declaration-of-war-on-gangs-after-father-shot-dead-in-front-of-son/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2728 Automatically insert print statements into your python code during runtime for debugging!", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/saurabh0719/constable", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran seizes cargo ship in Strait of Hormuz, Iranian media says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/ukmto-receives-report-incident-50nm-northeast-uaes-fujairah-2024-04-13/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Haiti establishes council to choose new leaders as gang violence rages", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/13/haiti-establishes-council-to-choose-new-leaders-as-gang-violence-rages", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Indian embassy relocates staff to Yangon as Myanmar conflict intensifies", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/indian-embassy-relocates-staff-to-yangon-as-myanmar-conflict-intensifies-13759044.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India &amp; Czech Republic In Talks To Forge Defence Partnership", "summary": "", "link": "https://menafn.com/1108085137/India-Czech-Republic-In-Talks-To-Forge-Defence-Partnership", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ireland says moving closer to recognising Palestinian state", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ireland-says-moving-closer-to-recognising-palestinian-state/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Police official shot to death in Acapulco, latest incident of deadly violence in Mexico's resort ", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-official-killed-acapulco-mexico/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Occupied between ~10,300 and 9300 years ago, the Neolithic site of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck in Central Anatolia went through early phases of sheep domestication", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj0954?utm_source=sfmc&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=alert&amp;utm_campaign=ADVeToc&amp;et_rid=1040788772&amp;et_cid=5174771", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Spain to deport dozens of Bolivians whose false visas held up cruise ship in Barcelona", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/spain-cruise-ship-bolivians-visas-schengen-ca23dcf3b2b5522b32cdf49c274538eb", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "The Masters: Tiger Woods conquers marathon 23-hole day to make record-breaking 24th consecutive cut at Augusta", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">The Masters: Tiger Woods conquers marathon 23-hole day to make record-breaking 24th consecutive cut at Augusta</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTIvc3BvcnQvdGlnZXItd29vZHMtdGhlLW1hc3RlcnMtY3V0LXJlY29yZC1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNC8xMi9zcG9ydC90aWdlci13b29kcy10aGUtbWFzdGVycy1jdXQtcmVjb3JkLXNwdC1pbnRs?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-04-12", "author": "None"}]}}};
