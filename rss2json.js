The vast majority of the damage \u2014 almost 80 percent \u2014 has occurred since Oct. 2, the day after Israel launched its ground invasion.\n\nSince then, the destruction has continued at a rapid pace, roughly doubling every two weeks, even as Israeli officials signal they are willing to begin negotiations to wind down the war.\n\nThe Post reached its findings by reviewing satellite imagery from southern Lebanon, verifying videos and obtaining an analysis of Sentinel-1 satellite radar data. In addition to the visible destruction wrought by Israeli airstrikes and intensifying ground battles, the videos show more than a dozen controlled demolitions carried out by the Israeli military, damaging or destroying at least nine religious sites.\n\nAfter multiple wars with Israel, many of the villages along the border in the Shiite-majority south are supportive of Hezbollah, and the group exercises control in some areas. But the region also includes towns with sizable Christian, Druze and Sunni Muslim populations, where Hezbollah has less influence.\n\nIsraeli forces appear to have made little effort to spare religious sites, and in some cases have reveled in their destruction.\n\nThe pattern of destruction along the length of the border is evidence that Israel is systematically clearing Lebanese border communities.\n\n[Read a copy of the rest of the article here](", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/31/israel-war-lebanon-south-destruction/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Georgia shatters turnout records ahead of final day of early voting", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2024/11/01/georgia-shatters-turnout-records-ahead-of-final-day-of-early-voting/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "GitHub -
