Repair phenomena: Disfluencies like \u201cuh\u201d or mid-sentence restarts confuse the agent unless explicitly filtered.

Today, descendants of the Ovaherero and Nama still fight for recognition, reparations, and restoration. Land remains dispossessed Cattle herding traditions disrupted, Cultural trauma unhealed yet In places like Mayas Angore and Omaheke, farmers rise again. They farm in dust. They dream in drought. They carry the legacy forward\u2014not just in words, but in soil, cattle, and resilience.\n\nNamibia\u2019s wounds are deep\u2014but its spirit is deeper.  Let us remember. Let us amplify. Let us stand with those who still live in the aftermath.\n\nwww.page-ix.com \n\n#NamibiaHistory #AfricanVoices #AfricanVision #RepublicOfBlackPress", "link": "https://i.redd.it/c2bpw2khhouf1.jpeg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Power restored to 800,000 in Kyiv after major Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-power-grid-assets-fe589dd9e12368d071fdfedf8819c15e", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Qatari officials killed in car crash near Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh, embassy says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/three-qatari-diplomats-killed-car-crash-egypts-sharm-el-sheikh-two-security-2025-10-11/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "My group is creating a website that lets you track your reading, chat with people, and unlock achievements based on your progress!", "summary": "Hey, all!\n\nI have to update the repo with the latest version of the plugins, but I wanted to share the repository anyway. I am graduating this semester, and I have to work on a major project that can be used on a resume, and provides something valuable to others.\n\nThe goal is to have a site that lets users register for free, track books that they are reading, discover what others are reading, and have fun with points, leaderboards, achievements, events, groups, and group competitions. Unlock rewards for contributing to the database, posting, commenting, and tracking your progress. Reach the next rank, unlock new themes and features, and climb the leaderboards!\n\nWe have a document with pages of ideas, bugs to be fixed, and things to be improved upon. The development is well ahead of schedule, and we are now trying to add a lot of the fun stuff that will set this site apart from others.\n\n  \nThe name of the website is GRead, and the link is the name and \".fun\". I don't know if I can post it, and I don't want to break the rules. We are blessed to have found a good host that offered us a year-long contract for a server and a domain, and the website has been live for a few weeks. There are three people on the team, yet we have made tremendous progress in a short amount of time.\n\nI am sharing this for a few reasons:\n\n1. I love the project. It's a ton of fun to work on, and I would use something like this project, even if I didn't work on it.\n\n2. While similar to other websites/services (GoodReads, for example), it has an emphasis on community, making friends, having fun, earning rewards, and competing with others. It's not a database, though it has one. It is not a social medium, but it has the features for one. It is a weird mix of all sorts of stuff, and I hope you guys like it.\n\n3. We have worked hard on this, and it's pretty frustrating to have so much passion and not see anybody care. Nobody is entitled to your interest, and I am not asking for people to look at this project out of pity. I am just sharing something I have worked on, something I am really proud of, and something I really hope others enjoy.\n\n4. We need feedback, ideas, and contributions to our database. We have implemented a system for automatically grabbing data from the OpenLibrary database, importing books, and making them available for users. On the Browse Books page, if you cannot find your book, you can add it and get credit for it. No matter what you are reading, you can help us out by going to the page, typing in the ISBN, and adding the book to our database.\n\n  \nI would be overjoyed to see even one person find this site and enjoy it. If you don't like the project, that's great, too. I just ask that you tell us why, so that we can make it better. Don't hold back on criticism, but please, provide us with legitimate ideas and things to change so that we can improve.\n\nAgain, the website is live, you can register, and you can start earning points. Use it as a book tracker (which is one of the major parts of the website, anyway), add it to your home screen (iOS), and talk to us about what you think. The team is made up of three college guys, and we are definitely nervous about letting others see our work. Help us make something really special. :)\n\n  \nThank you for your time.", "link": "https://github.com/GRead-Development/GRead", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Taliban, Pakistani forces trade heavy fire along Afghanistan border", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/12/taliban-pakistani-forces-trade-heavy-fire-along-afghanistan-border", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
