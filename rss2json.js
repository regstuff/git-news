For the uninitiated, Bilateral investment treaties are agreements between countries that protect foreign investors. They typically allow investors to directly sue host governments in international arbitration if their investments are harmed and India signed about 80 of these treaties from 1994 to 2010, mostly during the liberalization era.\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, India faced multiple investment arbitration claims and foreign investors challenged retroactive tax changes (Vodafone, Cairn Energy cases), cancellation of telecom licenses, state government actions, and other measures. India lost several high-profile cases with damages in hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe study examines one case in detail, Devas, a company with foreign investors, had a satellite spectrum contract cancelled by India in 2011. Two arbitration tribunals ordered India to pay $292 million combined. What makes this case particularly significant is that India apparently had evidence of corruption but failed to raise it during hearings due to lack of coordination between the ministry handling arbitration and investigative agencies conducting criminal probes. (Why it was never disclosed to tribunal, your guess is as good as mine). \n\nAfter burning its hand one too many times, in 2016, India took dramatic action and adopted a completely new Model BIT with provisions including:\n\n* Requiring investors to exhaust local remedies for minimum 5 years before international arbitration\n* Narrower definition of what counts as protected investment\n* Explicit obligations on investors regarding corruption and corporate social responsibility\n* Removed most-favored-nation and umbrella clauses that had been interpreted expansively\n\nThen India terminated 68 bilateral investment treaties between 2016 and present and these treaties ceased to exist after one-year notice periods and we claim to be negotiating new treaties with 37 countries or blocs based on the 2016 Model. But in 8 years, India has only signed 4 new treaties: with Belarus, Taiwan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Brazil.\n\nThe author characterizes this as \"limited engagement\" and suggests most countries find India's approach unacceptable. Even the EU, which launched negotiations with India in 2021, is reportedly skeptical about provisions like the 5-year local remedies exhaustion requirement.\n\nThe study frames this as part of what scholars call \"de-legalization\" of international economic law. Countries redirect decision-making from international rules and adjudication to national rules and domestic courts.\n\nThis makes sense from a sovereignty perspective as after losing cases where international tribunals second-guessed Indian tax policy and regulatory decisions, there's a natural impulse to reassert control but the execution reveals tensions in India's approach:\n\n* The government needed to respond to high-profile arbitration losses. Mass treaty termination and restrictive new models signal that India won't accept constraints on policy space.\n* Most countries aren't willing to sign investment treaties that essentially route everything through Indian domestic courts for 5 years. They view this as defeating the purpose of investment treaties, which is to provide neutral international dispute resolution.\n* India has significantly reduced legal protections for foreign investment without securing benefits it hoped for from treaty reform.\n\nThe study is part of a book on Asian investment arbitration, which suggests these tensions aren't unique to India but India's response appears more dramatic than most. China, for instance, has also been reforming its treaty practice but hasn't engaged in mass terminations to the same extent. Indonesia terminated some treaties but has been more successful at renegotiating replacements. India's approach seems to reflect a particular moment where domestic political pressure for visible action outweighed concerns about whether the replacement strategy was viable.\n\nThere's an interesting postscript, in 2022, India signed a Joint Interpretative Statement with Mauritius (one of the terminated treaties had a 10-year sunset clause for existing investments) stating that mere allegations of corruption are sufficient to deny treaty protections, without requiring proof or conviction.\n\nThis appears specifically targeted at ongoing Devas-related claims where the investors had brought a fresh arbitration after India's Supreme Court in 2022 ruled Devas was fraudulently incorporated. The author suggests this language is \"unduly harsh\" and could be abused, since it allows states to defeat claims just by alleging corruption without proving it.\n\nThis case study illustrates tensions in how emerging economies engage with international economic law frameworks created largely by developed countries:\n\n1. Asymmetric Impact: Investment treaties were originally meant to protect Western investors in developing countries. When India attracted significant foreign investment and became a respondent in arbitrations, the system's constraints became more visible.\n2. Limited Negotiating Power: India's attempt to rewrite the rules on its own terms hasn't worked because it needs treaty partners to agree. Unlike China, which can use market size as leverage, India hasn't been able to make its new model attractive enough.\n3. Domestic vs International Audiences: The policy serves domestic political needs (showing responsiveness to arbitration losses) even if it doesn't achieve international goals (actually creating viable new treaty framework).\n4. Path Dependence: Having terminated 68 treaties, it's now difficult to reverse course without appearing to back down, even if the replacement strategy isn't working.\n\nAll this leads to a lot of unanswered questions:-\n\nDoes India's experience suggest that the investment treaty system needs fundamental reform to be acceptable to major emerging economies?\n\nIs India's failure to sign new treaties evidence that its approach is too extreme, or that other countries are unreasonably unwilling to accommodate legitimate sovereignty concerns?\n\nCould this pattern repeat with other areas of international economic law if emerging economies become dissatisfied with perceived constraints on policy space?\n\nIs the 5-year local remedies exhaustion requirement really that unreasonable, or do developed countries oppose it simply because it reduces their leverage?\n\nThis analysis draws from Chapter 9 \"Corruption and Investment Treaty Arbitration in India\" by Professor Prabhash Ranjan (Jindal Global Law School) in \"Corruption and Illegality in Asian Investment Arbitration\" published by Springer in 2024. The chapter provides detailed examination of India's treaty practice evolution from 2015 to present, including analysis of the Model BIT drafting process, treaty terminations, and key arbitration cases.

As Ive been studying history, i took archy classes and found that im really interested in the field. I love studying history, but jobs arent great and I dont have many plans for what to do with it outside of academia. Im on track to graduate in a year but am able to add the archaeology degree for just an extra year. It wont take much more for me to complete my second degree if i choose to.\n\nMy question is to Canadian archaeologists or Canadians who graduated with a BA in archaeology: what was it like securing a job? how many of you work in CRM and how many of you work in other forms of archaeology?\nhow is the job/life balance? is there room for career progression? \n\nMy goal was to work with government in some way or another, how feasible is that? Im not 100% sure if i love field work yet and am wondering if there are career options outside of the field. I also live in Calgary Alberta and hope to stay here for a few years for the beginning of my career. what is the job market like out here in the west? \n\nAny information would be appreciated.
