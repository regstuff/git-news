However, it also found that he cannot request an apology for the error.\n\nThe ruling comes as part of a long-running legal battle fought by Stanis\u0142aw Zalewski (pictured above), a former member of the Polish underground resistance who is president of the Polish Association of Former Political Prisoners of Nazi Prisons and Concentration Camps. He turned 100 in October.\n\nThe case originated in April 2017, when a German newspaper publisher, Mittelbayerischer Verlag KG, published an article about a Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivor whose sister, it said, was \u201cmurdered in the Polish extermination camp of Treblinka\u201d.\n\nInternational media often mistakenly refer to Nazi-German camps established in occupied Poland as \u201cPolish\u201d. The Polish authorities have long campaigned against such usage, as it suggests that Poland, rather than Germany, was responsible for establishing and running the camps.\n\nIn this case, Mittelbayerischer Verlag changed its article within a few hours following intervention by the Polish consulate in Munich. Its corrected text stated that the sister \u201cwas murdered by the Nazis in the German Nazi extermination camp of Treblinka in occupied Poland\u201d.\n\nHowever, seven months later, in November 2017, Zalewski filed a civic lawsuit against the publisher at a Warsaw court demanding that it refrain from using the term \u201cPolish camps\u201d, publish an apology on its website for infringing his personal rights, and pay 50,000 zloty (\u20ac11,800) to his association.\n\nThat sparked a complex legal battle, as the case made its way between various Polish courts, including the Supreme Court, and also the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nAt question were two central and related issues: whether Zalewski, who was not referred to in Mittelbayerischer Verlag\u2019s article, had the right to bring the case; and whether he was able to bring it in Poland, rather than Germany.\n\nEventually, earlier this year, the Supreme Court found that the case could be heard in Poland. On Wednesday last week, however, in a closed session, the court of appeal in Warsaw ruled that, while Zalewski can pursue compensation, he cannot demand an apology, reports the\u00a0*Rzeczpospolita*\u00a0daily.\n\nWhat that means in effect is that\u00a0Zalewski could now return to the lower courts and seek compensation. Legal news service [Prawo.pl]( notes that Zalewski could also appeal to the Supreme Court against last week\u2019s ruling, arguing that he should also be allowed to seek an apology.\n\nHowever, given that he has just turned 100, the case is a \u201crace against time\u201d and a further appeal could \u201cdelay the proceedings for several more years\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIn the past, another former Polish prisoner of Auschwitz, Karol Tendera, fought a similar legal battle with German public broadcaster ZDF, demanding an apology for its use of the term \u201cPolish death camp\u201d. The case was then\u00a0[continued by his son](\u00a0following Tendera\u2019s death in 2019.\n\nIn a separate case, ZDF was\u00a0[ordered](\u00a0by a Polish court to apologise\u00a0for portraying Polish World War Two resistance fighters as antisemites in its drama series\u00a0*Generation War*\u00a0(*Unsere M\u00fctter, unsere V\u00e4ter*).\n\nSuch issues continue to cause controversy. Last week, the Polish government\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0Israel\u2019s Holocaust remembrance centre, Yad Vashem, for a social media post suggesting that Poland was responsible for introducing anti-Jewish measures during the Holocaust rather than the Nazi-German occupiers.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/01/former-auschwitz-prisoner-can-sue-german-publisher-for-writing-polish-death-camp-rules-court/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Putin warns Europe: if you want war, then Russia will defeat you", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-that-if-europe-wants-war-then-russia-is-ready-2025-12-02/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[UK] Jury trials scrapped for crimes with sentences of less than three years", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn5lxg2l0lqo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "European Central Bank refuses to provide backstop for $163 billion Ukraine loan", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/business/ecb-refuses-provide-backstop-163-billion-ukraine-loan-ft-reports-2025-12-02/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gaza: study reveals unprecedented losses of life and life expectancy - Life expectancy in Gaza has fallen in 2024 to less than half of the level that would be expected without the war.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.mpg.de/25778228/1125-defo-gaza-study-reveals-unprecedented-losses-of-life-and-life-expectancy-154642-x?c=2249", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Outdoor Concerts? Uncovered Hair? Shimmying in Public? Is This Iran?", "summary": "###Young people across Iran have been leading a dramatic change in social mores in recent months. \u201cWe have a fearless young generation that is breaking taboos.\u201d\n\nThousands of young men and women, hair uncovered and dressed in jeans and short-sleeve tops, [jumped up and down, dancing and singing a]( a packed outdoor pop concert.\n\nIt is a stark contrast to just five years ago, when women could be beaten and dragged into police vans for showing a few strands of hair, security forces raided homes to break up house parties, and dancing was banned in public.\n\n\u201cThe society is changing at a very fast speed, almost like a shedding of skin. Aside from the openings we see in social space, we have a fearless young generation that is breaking taboos,\u201d Donya Amiri, a 33-year-old fashion critic and designer in Tehran, said in an interview. \u201cThe young generation wants its basic freedoms, and it\u2019s getting them through sheer perseverance.\u201d\n\nScores of [videos shared on social media]( and interviews conducted with more than two dozen Iranians \u2014 among them artists, designers, musicians, entrepreneurs, university students, as well as sociologists and political analysts \u2014 depict a country in the throes of grassroots change.\n\nPolitical dissent is still not tolerated, executions and death sentences are frequent, and security agents in early November arrested at least four scholars, economists and writers who had been critical of the system. But the government of President Masoud Pezeshkian, a cardiac surgeon who campaigned on granting more social freedoms, seems unwilling or unable to confront the tide of change and is perhaps wary of crackdowns backfiring and inciting unrest.\n\nThe government is already dealing with crisis upon crisis, including a dire economy, recovery from war with Israel, and [an acute shortage of water]( and energy resources. Dancing lifts the gloom.\n\nIt is grassroots change from a new generation of Iranians who, connected to the outside world through social media and less fearful of arrest, are testing boundaries and reclaiming public spaces from the Islamic government, long known for its stifling restrictions on mixed gender gatherings, dancing, singing, alcohol and Western-style events.\n\nFatemeh Hassani, a sociologist who studies social developments, said in an interview from Tehran that the boundaries of public and private life are increasingly blurred as young people refuse to live a double life.\n\nThe government itself has jumped on the bandwagon of the trend, if a little tentatively.\n\nIn September, it organized a series of free outdoor music events across the country called happiness concerts, inviting top singers and bands to perform for the public to cement the nationalism forged as the country responded to the 12-day war with Israel in June. The move was a first of its kind: Iran\u2019s government typically holds its celebratory events at mosques with public prayer services, not pop concerts. [The concerts were a huge hit]( with more than one million people attending.\n\nThe departure from Islamic rules has irked conservatives who have called for the judiciary and security forces to act. Iranian news media reported last week that the Ministry of Intelligence had provided the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with a confidential report on the departure from Islamic social rules and the decline in women wearing the hijab, and that Mr. Khamenei had ordered the government to bring the youth and women back in line.\n\nAnalysts say that the joy and fun on display across Iran does not mean that the young generation is indifferent to the economic problems afflicting the country or the sporadic attempts by the Islamic regime to crack down.
