However, their unprecedented scale comes with significant  computational costs. These models, often consisting of billions of  parameters, require vast amounts of computational resources for  execution. Especially, the expansive scale and computational demands  pose considerable challenges when customizing them for particular  downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platforms constrained  by computational capabilities.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning** (**PEFT**)  provides a practical solution by efficiently adapt the large models over  the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process  of adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it  to a specific task while minimizing the number of additional parameters  introduced or computational resources required. This approach is  particularly important when dealing with large language models with high  parameter counts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be  computationally expensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable  challenges in the supporting system platform design.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In this survey, we  present comprehensive studies of various PEFT algorithms, examining  their performance and computational overhead. Moreover, we provide an  overview of applications developed using different PEFT algorithms and  discuss common techniques employed to mitigate computation costs for  PEFT. In addition to the algorithmic perspective, we overview various  real-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs  associated with different PEFT algorithms. This survey serves as an  indispensable resource for researchers aiming to understand both the  PEFT algorithm and its system implementation, offering detailed insights  into recent advancements and practical applications.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1cduqzm/parameterefficient_finetuning_for_large_models_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Did we just receive an AI-generated meta-review?", "summary": "", "link": "https://opensamizdat.com/posts/llm_meta_review/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for a mentor !", "summary": "Hello people,\n\nI am a masters student, studying NLP right now and wrapping up my thesis.
