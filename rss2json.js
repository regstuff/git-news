But he said he would still be \u201cproud to present such candidates for the next term of parliament\u201d. Braun himself last month\u00a0[went on trial](\u00a0for a range of offences, including his 2023 attack on a Jewish religious celebration in parliament.\n\nBraun, a member of the European Parliament, rose to prominence last year on the back of a presidential campaign centred around\u00a0[antisemitic](\u00a0[anti-Ukrainian](\u00a0and\u00a0[anti-LGBT](\u00a0rhetoric. He finished a surprised\u00a0[fourth in the election]( with 6.3% of the vote, and his party is now averaging around 8% support in the polls.\n\nBut he has also faced accusations of sympathy towards Russia, and government spokesman Adam Sz\u0142apka said on Tuesday that naming Piskorski as a candidate shows that \u201cBraun is no longer even trying to hide his connections with Russia\u201d.\n\nPiskorski, who between 2005 and 2007 was an MP representing the populist Self-Defence (Samoobrona) party, is known for his sympathetic views towards Russia. That is highly unusual in Poland, where animosity towards Russia is\u00a0[almost universal](\u00a0among the general public and political parties.\n\nIn 2014, Piskorski acted as the head of a group of \u201cindependent\u201d observers allowed to oversee Russia\u2019s referendum to annex Ukraine. Afterwards, Piskorski\u00a0[said](\u00a0that the referendum had been \u201cconducted in accordance with the law\u201d with \u201cno violations of generally accepted standards\u201d.\n\nHe also\u00a0criticised those who just \u201crepeat the arguments of one side of this conflict and use stereotypes like \u2018bad Russians'\u201d. He accused the West of being responsible for Vladimir Putin taking action against Ukraine, which he described as a \u201cfailed state\u201d.\n\nIn 2015, when establishing a new party in Poland called Change (Zmiana), Piskorski told Kremlin news outlet Sputnik that its aim was to \u201crebuild relations with Russia\u201d so the two countries would \u201conce again become partners\u201d. He also founded a think tank that has been\u00a0[accused](\u00a0of receiving Russian money.\n\nIn May 2016, Piskorski was detained by Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency (ABW) and charged with espionage on behalf of Russian and Chinese intelligence. Two years later, he was indicted to stand trial.\n\nIn April 2019, the trial began. But, almost seven years later, no verdict has been issued. Because the trial is classified, it is unknown what stage it is at or what evidence has been presented, notes OKO.press.\n\nMeanwhile, in May 2019, after being held in pretrial detention for three years, Piskorski was released on a 200,000 zloty (\u20ac47,500) bail but banned from leaving the country. Since then, he has regularly appeared as a commentator on Russian and Belarusian state-linked media outlets.\n\nLast year, another former member of Piskorski\u2019s Change party, named only as Janusz N. under Polish privacy law, was\u00a0[indicted by Polish prosecutors](\u00a0on charges of espionage on behalf of Russia.\n\nBraun himself has long been accused of having sympathies towards and links to Russia. In 2019,\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*, a leading Polish daily,\u00a0[published](\u00a0photos of Braun in Moscow the previous year meeting with Leonid Sviridov, a Russian journalist expelled from Poland in 2015 on suspicion of espionage.\n\nIn September last year, after Russian drones violated Polish airspace, Braun\u00a0[claimed](\u00a0that the incident was faked as part of a conspiracy, involving Poland\u2019s own government, to drag the country into the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn November, Braun and fellow KPP politicians wrote to Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov calling for a \u201cnormalisation in\u00a0Polish-Russian\u00a0relations\u201d.\u00a0[OKO.press]( notes that, during his recent political activity, Braun has been \u201copenly collaborating with pro-Russian figures\u201d.\n\nUntil a year ago, Braun and his KPP were part of Confederation (Konfederacja), a far-right alliance that sits in Poland\u2019s parliament. However, he was expelled after announcing a presidential run despite Confederation naming another of its leaders, S\u0142awomir Mentzen, as its candidate.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/07/polish-far-right-leader-braun-names-man-on-trial-for-russian-espionage-as-election-candidate/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iran hangs alleged Israeli spy, leans into anti-Western bluster as it tries to quell deadly protests", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-protests-us-trump-threat-deaths-mount/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel's foreign minister on historic visit to Somaliland", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyrexdgzn9o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "EU announces rise in deportations, while Denmark signals it is prepared to overstep ECHR", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/69018/eu-announces-rise-in-deportations-while-denmark-signals-it-is-prepared-to-overstep-echr", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sudan civil war: Children among 13 killed after drone hits home in el-Obeid city, medics say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74w54783zeo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Italy plans to back Mercosur, paving way for new EU trade deal", "summary": "[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1q6v5r0/italy_plans_to_back_mercosur_paving_way_for_new/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland will be \u201clead country\u201d on logistics for Ukraine peace deal, says Tusk after Paris talks", "summary": "Poland will be \u201cthe lead country\u201d when it comes to overseeing logistical support for Ukraine after a potential peace deal with Russia, Prime Minister Donald Tusk has announced following talks between the so-called Coalition of the Willing in Paris.\n\nTusk also reiterated that Poland\u2019s allies understand and accept that there will be no Polish troops on the ground in Ukraine as part of any peace process.
