They want to explore options with Russia, China, Turkey and other powers.\n\nChad\u2019s President Mahamat Deby would not have made this decision if he did not have security guarantees from another actor. We know he\u2019s received serious support from the United Arab Emirates, who are very interested in what\u2019s going on in neighboring Sudan and Darfur. We know that Turkey also made some outreach.\n\nChad borders four countries with Russian military presence. In January, Deby traveled to Moscow to reinforce relations with the \u201cpartner country.\u201d\n\nMilitary leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso who expelled the French military have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians.\n\nBut the security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from both armed groups and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase over the previous six months.\n\nIt is impossible to say whether the departure of French forces led to the increased violence. But it created a \u201chuge security vacuum,\u201d said analyst Shaantanu Shankar with the Economist Intelligence Unit, adding that it cannot be filled by Russia.

And since there is still quite a lot of time until the admissions to master's programs start, I am hoping to brush up on what might be most useful for someone wanting to pursue a master's degree in CL/NLP/LT or learn completely new things.\n\nSo, my question is this: Considering what you do -whether working in the industry or pursuing higher education- how would you delve into CL/NLP/LT if you were to wake up as a complete beginner in today's world? (Feel free to consider me a \"newbie\" when giving advice, some other beginners looking for help might find it more useful that way). What would your \"road map\" be when starting out?\n\nDo you think it would be better to focus on computer science courses (I was thinking of Harvard's CS50) to build a solid background in CS first, learn how to code using Python or learn about statistics, algorithms, maths etc.?\n\nI am hoping to dedicate around 15-20 hours every week to whatever I will be doing and just to clarify, I am not looking for a way to get a job in the industry without further education; so, I am not looking for ways to be an \"expert\". I am just wondering what you think would prepare me the best for a master's program in CL/NLP/LT.\n\nI know there probably is no \"best\" way of doing it but I would appreciate any advice or insight.
