So when the whole AI revolution started, I jumped right on board.\n\nAfter I started to learn how to create better prompts, I amassed a large library of prompts that I was using frequently. At first, I was saving them in a plain text file and saving them in a folder on my computer, but that obviously wasn't going to be efficient. So I started storing them in SnippetsLab on my Mac. It seemed like a decent solution until I started building a HUGE library of prompts that I had \"borrowed\" from others on the internet.\n\nFast forward a year and a half when I started seeing videos of people building web apps using AI. I thought to myself, \"I know web design and front-end code. I can definitely do that!\" I didn't even know the term \"vibe coding\" yet.\n\nSo I started doing some research. I found some videos on people using Webflow/Wized/Xano and thought, \"That's easy!\" So I started to play around with it. It was fairly easy, but definitely not an Easy Button. Then I found Bubble. I watched hours of videos and thought that this was the future. But I realized that I was locked into their platform and if they went under, I'd be screwed.\n\nThat's when I found Lovable. Before you start shitting on Lovable, hear me out. As I said before, I had amassed that large library of prompts that I was reusing. So I figured I could build a web app to store my prompts. I could organize them using categories and tags and be able to search for them. I built my first version, but ran into tons of bugs.\n\nThat's when I realized that prompting for Lovable was similar to prompting for everything else. The output is only as good as the input. So I created a custom GPT agent that was specifically trained on the Lovable documentation.\n\nThat's when things took off for me. I started building prompt storage features that helped me keep them organized. When I was telling a friend of mine about this, he said, \"That's a great idea! Can I use it?\" I said, \"Hell yes! Maybe we can swap prompts and learn from each other.\"\n\nThat's when it dawned on me that it would be great to have a social prompt organization platform where AI prompt enthusiasts could share what is working for them and learn from each other. Sure, there were other prompt organization tools out there, but none that brought the social aspect.\n\nSo I vibe coded [Musebox]( It's a prompt organization tool that brings in the social aspect where users can share their prompts and learn from each other.\n\nI just launched the site last week and would love for the r/PromptEngineering community to give me their feedback. I want to give free lifetime memberships to the users here if they are interested. I want to make this a place where people can share their prompts and learn new techniques. I even have discussion forums where you can give tips and techniques to good prompting. If you would like a free lifetime membership, send me a DM.\n\nThanks for reading my post!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lu10xs/my_ai_prompting_journey/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jukebox - Collaborative Music Queue for Groups (No Accounts Required!)", "summary": "**GitHub:** [github.com/skeptrunedev/jukebox](  \n**Live Demo:** [jukeboxhq.com](\n\n## What is it?\n\nJukebox is a lightweight, MIT-licensed alternative to Spotify's Collaborative Jam.

I\u2019ve attached the specific part I\u2019m referring to (see image).\n\nHere\u2019s the gist:\n\nThe paper emphasizes that the co-occurrence matrix should be symmetric in the sense that the relationship between a word and its context should remain unchanged if we swap them. So ideally, if word \\*i\\* appears in the context of word \\*k\\*, the reverse should hold true in a symmetric fashion.\n\nHowever, in Equation (3), this symmetry is violated. The paper notes that simply swapping the roles of the word and context vectors (i.e., \\w \u2194 \ud835\udc64\u0303\\ and \\X \u2194 X\u1d40\\) doesn\u2019t restore symmetry, and instead proposes a two-step fix ?\n\nMy question is:\n\n\\*\\*Why exactly does a naive role exchange not restore symmetry?\\*\\*\n\nWhy can't we just swap the word and context vectors (along with transposing the co-occurrence matrix) and call it a day?
