It is a rare instance of continuation after the Trump administration [froze all foreign funding]( last year and unleashed Elon Musk\u2019s [Department of Government Efficiency]( to tear down the agency that [delivered U.S. foreign aid]( for 60 years.\n\nOut of that destruction, which cost [tens of thousands of jobs]( and caused [people around the world to die]( many private efforts were made to preserve decades of data and knowledge housed at USAID, help recipients [keep vital programs running]( and [reimagine how international development]( might work.\n\nBut few of those efforts have managed to attract the kind of philanthropic funding that the DIV Fund has.\n\nSome of the leaders of the new nonprofit were also involved in directing [$110 million from private philanthropy]( in the past year to projects that lost funding from USAID. Now, the DIV Fund aims to grant out $25 million annually, which represents a little more than half of DIV\u2019s budget at USAID.\n\n##The ingredients of success\n\nTheir fundraising success has a couple of ingredients.\n\nFirst, the nonprofit DIV Fund acts like a research and development hub to identify very affordable and efficient interventions and then to support their expansion to scale. As such, their budget is very small compared to programs that treat or prevent HIV or respond to famine, for example.\n\nThen, while they were a division at USAID, DIV had already won outside philanthropic funding, including a $45 million grant from [Coefficient Giving]( a San Francisco-based funder that is now one of the nonprofit\u2019s anchor donors. The other funder is anonymous.\n\nFinally, Kremer said the programs they identify generally get funding from local governments or earn revenue, rather than depending on long term funding from donor countries like the U.S. That path to sustainability is even more important in the face of major cuts to foreign assistance from multiple historic donor countries.\n\n##See also:\n\n[World discovers it can hedge US trade risk \u2022 No one seeking outright decoupling from US, but risk-hedging is driving spate of new deals \u2022 Big powers could still set limits for rest of world]( (Reuters)", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/div-fund-usaid-foreign-aid-3d4b69f8a1c53fae17a39fd9af1f4f00", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan mosque explosion: More than 30 dead and 169 injured, officials say", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7y7gz2835o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Drone attack by paramilitary group in Sudan kills 24, including 8 children", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/drone-attack-by-paramilitary-group-in-sudan-kills-24-including-8-children", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poverty rate in Argentina down to 26.9%, the first time below 30% since 2017.", "summary": "[\n\n  \n[", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/1qyj6ef/poverty_rate_in_argentina_down_to_269_the_first/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland\u2019s gas exports hit new high on strong demand from Ukraine", "summary": "Poland has recorded its highest-ever daily level of gas exports, as rising demand from Ukraine, which has been suffering a winter energy crisis amid Russian attacks, pushed up cross-border flows.\n\nDaily gas exports rose to 13.9 million cubic metres on Tuesday, mostly to Ukraine, according to data from Polish transmission operator Gaz-System. That came days after Poland\u00a0[increased its export capacity](\u00a0to help supply its eastern neighbour.\n\nThe surge in exports pushed total transmission through the national gas network in Poland \u2013 which itself imports most of its gas from abroad, particularly Norway, the United States and Qatar \u2013 to 115.4 million cubic metres in a single day, which was also a new record.\n\nMonthly volumes have also climbed. In January, gas transport through the system exceeded 3 billion cubic metres, with average daily transmission of about 97 million cubic metres. That was 45% higher than a year earlier, due to\u00a0[colder weather](\u00a0and growing domestic gas use and exports.\n\nFrom the start of February, Poland began boosting its capacity for gas exports to Ukraine. It will rise around 20%, from 15.3 million cubic metres per day previously to 18.4 million cubic metres by the end of April.\n\nLast year, Poland had already\u00a0[taken steps](\u00a0to increase supplies to Ukraine.

These included the expansion of domestic and cross-border pipeline connections, additional gas storage capacity and the development of the LNG terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie.\n\nFurther expansion is underway, centred on a\u00a0[floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) terminal in Gda\u0144sk]( The terminal is scheduled to begin operations in early 2028 and is expected to enable annual LNG imports of up to 6.1 billion cubic metres.\n\nThe latest highs come after a series of records in Poland\u2019s energy system in January, when freezing temperatures \u2013 dropping below -20 degrees in many places \u2013 drove[\u00a0gas consumption](\u00a0and\u00a0[power generation](\u00a0to historic peaks.\n\nPoland has been ramping up its use of gas in recent years as it gradually moves away from coal, which still produces\u00a0[most of the country\u2019s electricity](\u00a0and is also burned to\u00a0[heat around a third of its homes](\n\nBy November, an\u00a0[annual record amount of gas](\u00a0had already been traded on the Polish Power Exchange (TGE).

However, the court\u2019s decision now opens the way for prosecutors to issue domestic and European arrest warrants for the suspect.\n\nZiobro is\u00a0[accused](\u00a0of committing a variety of crimes, including leading a criminal group, abusing his powers and approving the unlawful purchase of Pegasus spyware, when he served as justice minister in the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government from 2015 to 2023.\n\nIf found guilty, he could face up to 25 years in prison. However, Ziobro denies the offences and claims to be a victim of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d against him by the current government, a coalition ranging from left to centre right led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nIn October, the government\u2019s majority in parliament\u00a0[approved the lifting of Ziobro\u2019s immunity](\u00a0from prosecution. However, he had by then already travelled to Hungary, whose ruling Fidesz party and Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n are allies of PiS.\n\nOn Thursday, a district court in Warsaw finally ruled on prosecutors\u2019 request to place Ziobro in pretrial detention. The hearing had previously twice been delayed after Ziobro\u2019s attorneys raised objections.\n\n\u201cThe court fully agreed with the arguments set out in the motion, finding that there was a general statutory basis for applying preventive measures \\[of pretrial detention\\], namely a high probability that the suspect committed the alleged acts,\u201d prosecutor Piotr Wo\u017aniak told journalists on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe next step will be to launch a search for the suspect using a domestic arrest warrant and a European Arrest Warrant,\u201d he added. He\u00a0[said](\u00a0the domestic warrant would likely be issued on Friday, while the request for an EAW is expected to be submitted to the district court early next week.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision was also welcomed by interior minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski, who wrote on social media that it was \u201ca symbol of the fight against evil, political corruption and the pathology of power\u201d. He added that the ruling also opens the way for an Interpol red notice to be issued for Ziobro.\n\nHowever, Bartosz Lewandowski, a lawyer representing Ziobro, said that they would file an appeal against the court\u2019s decision and would in the meantime apply for enforcement of the decision to be suspended pending that appeal.\n\nZiobro himself told conservative broadcaster Republika that he had \u201cexpected this decision because I see what is happening in Poland\u201d. He has previously claimed that the government has weaponised the legal system against him and that he will only\u00a0[return to face justice when the rule of law is restored](\n\nThe Hungarian authorities have endorsed those claims, granting Ziobro asylum in December on the basis that he was facing political persecution in Poland. They previously also granted asylum to one of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy ministers,\u00a0[Marcin Romanowski]( who has also fled criminal charges in Poland.\n\nGiven that Ziobro has asylum, it is unlikely that Hungary would currently comply with an EAW, just as they have refused to hand over Romanowski. However, that situation could change if Orb\u00e1n loses power in April\u2019s parliamentary elections.\n\nCommenting on Thursday\u2019s ruling, another of Ziobro\u2019s former deputy ministers, Micha\u0142 W\u00f3jcik, said that ti shows \u201cwe live under a regime\u201d in Poland and that there would only be an independent judiciary once the current government is removed from power.\n\nTusk\u2019s government has made it one of its priorities to hold to account former PiS officials for alleged crimes.
