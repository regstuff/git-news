And what's unfortunate is that for most of these people, we end up passing.\n\nSo many posts I see here about field schools are about experiences abroad. I am here to tell you that these are *not* beneficial if your goal is to potentially get a job working in archaeology in the US when you graduate. Even if you just want a year or two before going on to graduate school or something else entirely, a non-US-based field school is going to be regarded as only slightly more than *no* experience in archaeology.\n\nPut simply, the methods and standards used in non-US and US archaeology are different enough that if you have no other experience, a non-US field school is not going to prepare you for US-based CRM. And a CRM firm is going to shuffle your resume to the bottom of the stack under most circumstances.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that US-based field schools are usually *cheaper* than the overseas options, too. So you're not even getting your money's worth.\n\nI get that overseas field schools are, at least in part, about the experience of traveling. And that's great, I absolutely think it's worth traveling to another place outside the US, expand your horizon.\n\nBut understand that if you get an overseas field school for the experience of traveling, *also* do a US-based field school for the experience of doing US-based archaeology.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1dajz0e/psa_for_all_usbased_archaeology_students_who_may/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jumpspeak App - Does it work?", "summary": "Does the Jumpspeak App work as it says it does?
