The find has garnered significant attention for its historical and architectural significance. Sambhal District Magistrate Rajender Pensiya described the structure, stating, \u201cThe well\u2019s upper floor is constructed of bricks, while the second and third floors are made of marble. The stepwell also features four chambers, a tunnel, and a well.\u201d The discovery of a tunnel within the stepwell has sparked speculation that it may have been used as an escape route during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
