This suggests that AI-assisted prompt revisions may affect users' ability to realize the full potential of a model.\r\n\r\n3/ The researchers identified two main reasons for the differences in performance between DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3: improved technical capabilities and adapted prompting strategies by users.
