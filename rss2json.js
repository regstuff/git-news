Canada currently enjoys the lowest effective tariff rate with the United States globally, while still seeing some key industries suffer from Mr. Trump\u2019s levies on autos, steel, aluminum and lumber.\n\nBut Canada also faces a review by this summer of its free-trade agreement with the United States and Mexico, which Mr. Trump is [considering abandoning]( at least in part.\n\nIn response to this volatility and Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestions that the United States take over Canada, Mr. Carney was elected to find a new normal in the important relationship, but also to strengthen Canada\u2019s links to other economies around the world.\n\nMr. Carney has traveled relentlessly \u2014 more than most Western leaders, a New York Times review shows \u2014 to secure investments and build relationships with countries in Europe and in Asia.\n\n# India: Bygones be bygones?\n\nMr. Carney\u2019s first stop is in Mumbai, where he lands Friday to meet business leaders before heading to New Delhi to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.\n\nIt\u2019s the most important and hardest part of his three-stop tour.\n\nJust over a year ago, Mr. Carney\u2019s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, disclosed that Canadian intelligence services and law enforcement believed that Indian diplomats in Canada, under orders from the government in New Delhi, had [helped orchestrate political assassinations]( [extortions and intimidation campaigns]( targeting Sikhs on Canadian soil.\n\nThe two countries nearly suspended diplomatic relations after Mr. Trudeau\u2019s 2024 statement, and expelled each other\u2019s top diplomats. But after Mr. Carney\u2019s election last spring, a thaw began, culminating in this visit.\n\nMr. Carney is trying to set all that aside as he seeks to announce important agreements with Mr. Modi, particularly to sell oil and uranium to India, officials said. India is a big potential market for Canadian oil, the vast majority of which currently goes south to the United States.\n\n# Australian Cousins, Japanese Partners\n\nMr. Carney\u2019s Australia visit is likely to be more like a family reunion. Those familial ties include a similar federal structure and political system, as well as economic traits, such as important mining sectors.\n\nBut some business is on the table in Australia, especially around investment prospects for each nation\u2019s well-endowed and mighty pension funds.\n\nMr. Carney\u2019s final stop is Japan, an important defense partner for Canada in the region, and joint pursuit of stability in the Indo-Pacific is likely to be high on the agenda.\n\nCanadian Armed Forces participate in numerous joint exercises and missions alongside Japanese counterparts.\n\nThe two countries, which are quintessential \u201cmiddle powers\u201d and both members of the Group of 7 biggest industrialized economies in the world, have long enjoyed a close relationship. But Mr. Carney is eager to pursue more economic cooperation with Japan, which has also expressed interest in buying more Canadian natural gas.\n\n-----\n\n[Here's a copy of the full article]( in case you get blocked from the original page.\n\n-----\n\n#See also:\n\n* [Prime Minister Carney to travel to India, Australia and Japan to diversify Canada trade away from US]( (Associated Press)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/world/canada/carney-asia-australia-visit.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mass graves found in eastern Congo after rebel withdrawal, governor says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/mass-graves-found-eastern-congo-after-rebel-withdrawal-governor-says-2026-02-27/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Israel's] High Court temporarily freezes ban on foreign aid organizations operating in Gaza", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-temporarily-freezes-ban-on-foreign-aid-organizations-operating-in-gaza/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Afghan Taliban open to talks after Pakistan bombs Kabul, Kandahar", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-strikes-afghanistan-targets-clashes-intensify-2026-02-27/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK withdraws embassy staff from Iran temporarily", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-withdraws-staff-iran-temporarily-2026-02-27/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pakistan declares 'open war' with Afghanistan as they trade deadly strikes", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/afghanistan/airstrikes-hit-afghan-capital-kabul-hours-afghanistan-attacks-pakistan-rcna260882", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Polish Supreme Court picks candidates for new chief justice despite boycott by some judges", "summary": "Poland\u2019s Supreme Court has nominated five candidates to become its new chief justice, replacing the outgoing Ma\u0142gorzata Manowska, whose six-year term will come to an end in May. President Karol Nawrocki will now decide which of the candidates will become the new head of the court.\n\nHowever, the process has been shrouded in controversy, as it was\u00a0[six years ago]( due to the ongoing\u00a0[rule-of-law crisis](\u00a0in Poland. Many of the court\u2019s judges have boycotted the election for a new chief justice as they do not recognise the legitimacy of their colleagues.\n\nThe process of choosing a new chief justice begins with the Supreme Court\u2019s judges (of whom there are currently 91) voting to select a shortlist of candidates from among their own members.\n\nThe five candidates who receive the most votes are then presented to the president, who must select one of them, at his own discretion, to become the new head of the court.\n\nManowska, who decided not to stand for a second term, originally called a meeting on Tuesday this week to select candidates to replace her. For that to take place, a quorum of 84 judges needed to be present. However, only 48 attended, meaning the meeting was cancelled.\n\nThe reason for the low attendance was that a large minority of judges on the Supreme Court have boycotted the process of choosing a new chief justice because they regard the majority of their colleagues, including Manowska, as holding their positions illegitimately.\n\nThe dispute stems from a decision by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government to overhaul the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), the body responsible for nominating judges, in 2017.\n\nPreviously, the KRS\u2019s members had been chosen mostly by judges themselves; after PiS\u2019s reforms, most were chosen by politicians. That rendered the KRS illegitimate, according to multiple\u00a0[Polish](\u00a0and\u00a0[European](\u00a0court rulings, as well as many expert bodies and Polish judges themselves.\n\nAs a consequence, many \u201cold\u201d judges appointed before the KRS reform regard \u201cnew\u201d judges appointed since then as illegitimate. On the Supreme Court, for example, over 60% of judges are \u201cnew\u201d and many of their \u201cold\u201d colleagues\u00a0[refuse to cooperate with them](\n\nA group of 29 \u201cold\u201d judges jointly signed a letter this week saying that they were refusing to participate in the election because Manowska herself, who launched the process, holds her position illegitimately while the participation of other \u201cnew\u201d judges also renders the elections invalid.\n\n\u201cWe will not participate in this theatre,\u201d one of the rebel judges, W\u0142odzimierz Wr\u00f3bel, told broadcaster TVN. \u201cThe entire procedure is\u2026not consistent with the law or the constitution.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Manowska attempted to hold a second meeting to choose candidates. Under the court\u2019s regulations, this time the quorum was lowered to 75. However, that figure was again not reached, with only 51 judges showing up.\n\nOn Thursday, a third meeting was called, with the quorum this time lowered to 32. Court spokesman Igor Zgoli\u0144ski confirmed that 53 judges had attended, allowing the meeting to take place. Six candidates to be the new chief justice were chosen, all of them \u201cnew\u201d judges.\n\nOn Friday, a vote then took place to choose the five who would be presented to the president. The candidate with the highest number of votes, 18, was\u00a0Zbigniew Kapi\u0144ski, a judge from the Supreme Court\u2019s criminal chamber.\n\nThe other four candidates who will be presented to Nawrocki are:\u00a0Mariusz Za\u0142ucki\u00a0(who received 13 votes),\u00a0Pawe\u0142 Czubik\u00a0(nine votes),\u00a0Aleksander St\u0119pkowski (five votes)\u00a0and\u00a0Tomasz Demendecki (five votes).\n\nThe final candidate,\u00a0Agnieszka G\u00f3ra-B\u0142aszczykowska, also received five votes, forcing a run-off with St\u0119powski and Demendecki. But in that second round she gained the fewest votes and was therefore eliminated.\n\nWhen Nawrocki makes his decision, he does not have to take into account how many votes each candidate received. He has complete discretion to choose any of the five candidates presented to him.\n\nNawrocki is aligned with PiS and accepts the legitimacy of the overhauled KRS and the \u201cnew\u201d judges nominated by it. However, the current government, which replaced PiS in office in December 2023, takes the opposite view.\n\nIt has sought to restore the KRS to its previous state before PiS\u2019s reforms. But Nawrocki earlier this month\u00a0[vetoed legislation](\u00a0to that effect.\n\nMeanwhile, the president\u00a0[submitted his own proposed law](\u00a0that would jail officials for up to ten years if they \u201cpersistently question\u201d his powers or those of judicial bodies filled with PiS-era appointees, such as the Supreme Court and Constitutional Tribunal (TK).\n\nManowska herself has clashed regularly with the current government. In December 2023, she and the head of the TK\u00a0[criticised](\u00a0proposals to roll back PiS-era reforms.

However, a\u00a0[first attempt](\u00a0to do so was blocked in 2024 by then-President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, and then a revised bill was[\u00a0vetoed last week](\u00a0by Nawrocki.\n\nThat means that 19 of the KRS\u2019s 25 members must still be chosen by the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, under the rules introduced by PiS.\n\nIn addition, two members are elected by the Senate, one is appointed by the president, and three more \u2013 the Supreme Court chief justice, the justice minister, and the president of the Supreme Administrative Court \u2013 sit on the body based on the other position they hold.\n\nWith the four-year terms of current KRS members set to expire on 12 May, the speaker of the Sejm was required earlier this month\u00a0[to launch the process](\u00a0of selecting replacements under existing rules.\n\nToday, the Sejm approved a resolution that is part of what the government calls a \u201cplan B\u201d that would allow judges to play a decisive role in picking KRS candidates, even though parliament would formally elect them under the current law.\n\nThe resolution says that the current KRS \u201cis not a body independent of other authorities\u201d because its judicial members are not representatives of the broader judicial community or of all types of courts.\n\nIt adds that, since \u201cthe effectiveness of the statutory changes adopted by the parliament was prevented by the refusal of the president to sign them, a special responsibility for restoring the constitutional standards of the KRS rests with the judicial community\u201d.\n\nThe resolution also said that Sejm \u201cwill take into account in its decisions the results of elections held by Polish judges in a universal and transparent\u201d manner.\n\nThe resolution was approved with 237 votes in favour, mostly from the ruling coalition, while 199 MPs, mainly from PiS and the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), voted against it.\n\nAccording to\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*, a leading daily, the presidents of ten of Poland\u2019s 11 appellate courts have said they are ready to help organise votes within the judiciary.\n\nUnder their proposal, judicial assemblies would vote on candidates, and the Sejm would appoint those who receive the strongest support.\n\n\u201cAlthough the election of the judicial members of the KRS would be made by politicians, the Sejm\u2019s acceptance of the nominations of all judges would ensure that such a body would meet constitutional standards and guarantee independence from political authorities,\u201d the court presidents said in a statement.\n\nThe ruling coalition argues that reforming the KRS is necessary to ensure legal certainty, as there are\u00a0[questions](\u00a0over the 3,000 or so judges appointed since the KRS was overhauled by PiS and the hundreds of thousands of rulings issued by them.\n\nPiS has defended the existing model, saying that allowing judges to elect fellow judges risks creating closed networks and weak democratic accountability.\n\n\u201cJudges in the KRS must have strong democratic legitimacy. Legitimacy that comes from the nation, not from your narrow, hermetic group of judges,\u201d PiS MP and former deputy justice minister Sebastian Kaleta, told the Sejm, quoted by\u00a0*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna*.\n\nHe described the resolution as a \u201csmokescreen\u201d aimed at achieving \u201cthe complete political takeover of the KRS\u201d.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/27/polish-parliament-pledges-to-take-into-account-judiciarys-picks-for-council-at-heart-of-rule-of-law-dispute/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
