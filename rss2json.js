Believed to have been built sometime around 1870-1888 for owner E.A. Gibbs, it was originally located at 709 Meridian and is quite possibly the oldest surviving frame residence in South Pasadena.\n \nBy the time it was being used to film 1978\u2019s Halloween, the house was in fairly rough shape. It was being used to store wheelchairs by the nearby hospital and has such had not been properly taken care of. Yet it was that very state that likely drew the film crew to the home, leading to it becoming a leading lady in the ultimately $70 million dollar box office success and long-lasting franchise.\n \nDevelopment ultimately threatened the structure in 1987. In total, seven homes were designated to be torn down, with the Century House the last one scheduled to be taken down. However, as the story goes, longtime Council Member, Submarine Veteran and \u201cThe Plumber Who Outwitted the IRS\u201d David Margrave rushed up to the bulldozer driver just as the dozer was about to give it a push. He managed to get into contact with then current owner Dr. Joseph Kohn and, with a silver dollar, purchased the home on the condition that he needed to move the house within a week. A task too large for just one person, he called upon the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation to help him save the historic home.\n \nIn a December 28th, 1987 letter, the foundation wrote to the Santa Fe Railroad with a request to lease the plot of land at 1000 Mission street, citing the historic value of the home, the support of the city, as well as showing that the home would not endanger the railroad\u2019s operations. Suffice to say the effort was successful and the home was moved down the street onto the triangular plot of land where it still stands today, with the property later being purchased outright.\n \nThe foundation would additionally successfully advocate for the changing of boundaries of the South Pasadena National Historic Business District to include the plot of land where the house was moved to, and, with further support of the Cultural Heritage Commission, established the home as South Pasadena Landmark #34. The request to have the home called the \u201cCentennial House\u201d by the CHC and the SPPF was rejected in favor of the \u201cCentury House\u201d\n \nIncluded alongside the historical images of the home, are some of the documents that go along with the story of saving the home. Documents and Images like these, along with several artifacts and other items related to the history of South Pasadena are available for viewing for any kind of research, from a high school essay, a YouTube video, a graduate school thesis, or even just someone who is curious about the history and perhaps has never gotten the chance to experience a museum archive. Appointments to see the archives can be arranged by emailing the Archivist + at sppfarchive@gmail.com (main floor of the SPPF museum is open to the public every Thursday from 4pm-8pm at 913 Meridian Ave).\n \nStill today, 46 years after Halloween put the home into the pages of Hollywood history, the home still attracts visitors from around the globe. The efforts made by David Margrave and the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation served to keep the leading lady standing and looking better than ever. One must wonder if Michael might think \u201cya know this was my childhood home but it\u2019s like too nice now, Ima go find another\u201d.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6eujm", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Columbia University temporarily bans pro-Israel professor Shai Davidai after October 7 protest", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/us/columbia-university-suspends-professor-shai-davidai/index.html", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
