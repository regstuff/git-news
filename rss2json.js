It intends to buy three A26 submarines from Swedish manufacturer Saab. The brand-new model, designed in particular for Baltic Sea operations, has not yet gone into service.\n\n\u201cTogether, Sweden and Poland will take greater responsibility for security in the Baltic Sea,\u201d said Sweden\u2019s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, celebrating the news. \u201cIn a time of uncertainty for our entire region, we are now strengthening our part of the world together.\u201d\n\nSeven manufacturers from six countries \u2013 Germany, Italy, France, Spain and South Korea, as well as Sweden \u2013 bid to be the supplier for Poland\u2019s Orka programme, which aims to modernise the Polish naval fleet.\n\nPoland currently only has one submarine, a 40-year-old Soviet-era vessel that is in need of constant repair.\n\nAt a cabinet meeting today, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that Sweden had been selected as the preferred supplier. The defence minister, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, said that they hoped to conclude an intergovernmental agreement with Sweden on the purchase \u201cwithin weeks\u201d.\n\n\u201cSweden presented the best offer according to\u2026an objective analysis of all criteria, including delivery time, price, value, and operational capability, especially in the Baltic Sea basin,\u201d said Kosiniak-Kamysz. \u201cSweden\u2019s offer was the only one that met all expectations.\u201d\n\nA key requirement was also \u201cacquiring additional skills for the Polish shipbuilding industry\u201d, and here the proposals \u201cfrom Sweden were the most far-reaching regarding investments in the Polish arms industry, servicing, and repairs\u201d, added the minister, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nIn a statement, Saab confirmed that their \u201cproposal includes cooperation with the Polish industry and knowledge transfer, securing a strategic partnership between Poland and Sweden\u201d.\n\nThe extent and nature of this partnership have not yet been revealed. But a Polish deputy defence minister, Cezary Tomczyk, claimed that \u201cSweden will invest hundreds of millions of zloty in the Polish shipbuilding industry.\n\nThe overall value of the deal has also not yet been confirmed, with Kosiniak-Kamysz saying it would be finalised after a final agreement is concluded. Saab\u2019s CEO, Micael Johansson, says that the firm is \u201clooking forward to the coming negotiations\u201d over the final terms of the deal.\n\nThere is also, as yet, no planned delivery date for Poland\u2019s submarines. However, Sweden\u2019s offer includes giving Polish sailors access from 2027 to more modern training ships in preparation for when the new submarines are ready.\n\nCurrently, the Polish navy\u2019s only submarine is the\u00a0*Orze\u0142*. Built in 1986, it is the oldest Kilo-class Soviet submarine still in service anywhere in the world and regularly breaks down.\n\nThis week, the\u00a0*Orze\u0142*\u00a0was meant to take part in celebrations of Poland\u2019s Navy Day on 28 November, but it \u201csuffered a malfunction\u201d that prevented it from leaving port, a navy press officer told news website Interia.\n\nBy contrast, Saab calls the A26\u00a0*Blekinge*\\-class \u201cthe world\u2019s most modern submarine\u201d. However, its development has faced repeated delays and cost overruns.\n\nIn 2015, the Swedish armed forces ordered two of the vessels, which were initially meant to be delivered between 2022 and 2024. However, that date has continually been pushed back, and delivery is now expected between 2031 and 2033.\n\nThe A26 is specifically designed for operations in the Baltic Sea, including protecting critical underwater infrastructure such as cables and pipelines. Its stealth systems are intended to make it very difficult to detect in the shallow Baltic waters.\n\nSpeaking to broadcaster TVN, however, Kosiniak-Kamysz noted that the new submarines would be capable of operating in various waters, not just the Baltic.\n\nIn recent years, Poland has\u00a0[increasingly oriented itself towards the Baltic region]( forming closer economic, energy and military ties with the Baltic and Nordic states.\n\nLast year, Poland and Sweden\u00a0[signed](\u00a0a strategic partnership on defence and economic ties. This year, Stockholm\u00a0[bought](\u00a0\u20ac274 million worth of Piorun man-portable air-defence systems from their Polish manufacturer.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/26/poland-picks-sweden-to-supply-submarines-for-its-navy/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Army officers say they have seized power in Guinea-Bissau", "summary": "The New Coup Era of West Africa continues, strong", "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/26/africa/guinea-bissau-army-depose-president-latam-intl", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How ICIJ traced hundreds of millions from Huione Group to major crypto exchanges", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.icij.org/investigations/coin-laundry/how-icij-traced-hundreds-of-millions-from-huione-group-to-major-crypto-exchanges/?utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Egyptian president el-Sisi to veto any election-related irregularities in House of Representatives election", "summary": "", "link": "https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/557600/Egypt/Politics-/ElSisi-to-veto-any-electionrelated-irregularities.aspx", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump Disinvites South Africa from 2026 G20, Halts Aid Over 'Abuses'", "summary": "", "link": "https://2x3news.com/post/trump-disinvites-south-africa-from-2026-g20-halts-aid-over-abuses-266", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
