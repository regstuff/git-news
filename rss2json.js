I\u2019m currently in my junior year of high school, and I just want to know what it\u2019s like to be an archaeologist.\nLike I want the less glamorous part of being one, because I don\u2019t just wanna go in with all the glamorous details. I want to know how the pay is, the field work, and how it is overall with your experience. \n\nAlso maybe y\u2019all could tell me what corses to take in school,\nThanks so much.

I\u2019m currently studying Politics in Toronto but have developed a deep interest in Archaeology.
