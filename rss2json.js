The main objective is for the system to be a useful tool to historians, so in the end I want to have an expert historian evaluate the validity of the LLMs' response.\n\nI've currently split up the poems in lines, embedded them all in a chromadb with ColBert v.2 embeddings (which are more fine-grained as they also embed keywords/terms separately). I also split up the journals in 5-grams and am using them as query text to fetch relevant poem snippets. I only have 20 'gold standard' samples of 5-grams which were found manually to evaluate the retrieval step.\n\nAny tips on how I can develop/improve upon this system? :) ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1irqh27/information_retrievaltext_reuse_poems_and_journals/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\"What western ambassadors do in India, if my ambassador, if my ambassador does a fraction of that, you will all be up in arms...\" EAM Dr S Jaishankar at Munich Security Conference on outreach to outliers", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/xix7hsa2znje1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI agents &amp; automation related discord servers collection", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/best-ai-agents/discord-servers-for-ai-agents", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dallas Police refuse to join ICE start community outreach instead.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.latintimes.com/dallas-police-refuses-join-ice-immigration-raids-launches-outreach-meetings-migrants-instead-575548", "author": "None"}, {"title": "All of Anna Kendrick\u2019s earnings from \u201cWoman of the Hour\u201d were donated to assault victims", "summary": "", "link": "https://krtio.com/all-of-anna-kendricks-earnings-from-woman-of-the-hour-were-donated-to-assault-victims/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Pro-Palestinian NGO seeks ICC arrest warrant for Israel\u2019s foreign minister", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/middleeast/ngo-seeks-icc-arrest-warrant-israel-saar-intl-latam/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Israel free trade deal on the cards in 2025: What it means for both nations", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/business/story/india-israel-free-trade-deal-on-the-cards-what-it-means-for-both-nations-piyush-goyal-nir-barkat-2681036-2025-02-17", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for a tool that generates phonetically similar phrases for pun generation", "summary": "I write jokes for a living. Well, I'm trying to anyway. And let me tell you, comedy isn't all pun and games. It takes a lot of systematic work. I've been thinking about how to make my life easier by automating some of the grunt work, especially when I'm writing articles and video scripts.\n\nSo here's what I'm trying to do:\n\n1. Generate relevant phrases based on my content\n\n2. Take these phrases and find phonetically similar variations\n\n3. Filter out the ones that don't make sense\n\nLet's use this post as an example:\n\nStep 1 would generate phrases like \"fun and games\"\n\nStep 2 would give me variations like \"pun and games\" or \"gun and games\"\n\nStep 3 would keep \"pun and games\" but toss out \"gun and games\" because this post isn't about guns\n\nI tried [using large language models to automate steps 1-3]( end-to-end, but it just didn't work as well as I hoped. These models don't explore enough options to find good puns, and they burn through a lot of tokens.\n\nLarge language models are great at step 1 (coming up with phrases) and step 3 (filtering for meaning), but step 2 (finding and replacing words based on sound) needs a more systematic, combinatorial approach.\n\nWhat I need is a tool that can handle step 2. It should:\n\n2.1. Take phrases I give it\n\n2.2. Find words that sound alike and swap them in\n\n2.3. Sort them by how close they sound to the original\n\nI've tried  [Rhymezone]( and [Pun Generator]( but they only work with one word at a time. I need something that can handle whole phrases and give me similar-sounding variations.\n\nDoes something like this exist? I'd also love to hear possible ways to build something like this or if there's a better approach I haven't thought of.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ir9v7c/looking_for_a_tool_that_generates_phonetically/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Top Russian and Amer\u00edcan officials will hold talks on ending the Ukraine war without Kyiv", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-saudi-talks-0c7f21c2125c97fd0a1f6459eebeb65b", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Fish species thought to be extinct for 85 years rediscovered", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/researchers-rediscovered-elusive-fish-species-thought-extinct-85/story?id=118895751", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hamas rejects disarmament, vows to fight \u2018Israel\u2019s agents\u2019 in Gaza after the war", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/middleeast/hamas-will-not-disarm-gaza-israel-intl/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canada plane crash latest: Emergency services attending reported plane crash at Toronto airport", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c0q080y02xgt", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gautam Adani Visits Tarapur Nuclear Site: Insights into India's Energy Sector", "summary": "", "link": "https://money.rediff.com/news/market/gautam-adani-visits-tarapur-nuclear-site-insights-into-india-s-energy-sector/22345420250217", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Starbucks swaps plastic for compostable cups in 14 states", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.fox5ny.com/news/starbucks-plastic-cups-replaced-compostable", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can we still be friends: Alaska town sends love letter to neighbours in Yukon", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/can-we-still-be-friends-alaska-town-sends-love-letter-to-neighbours-in-yukon-1.7459860", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India may take Rafale route to buy US F35 fighter jets: Govt likely to opt for limited numbers; may require special monitoring clauses", "summary": "", "link": "https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/india-may-take-rafale-route-to-buy-us-f35-fighter-jets-govt-likely-to-opt-for-limited-numbers-may-require-special-monitoring-clauses/articleshow/118308940.cms", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Special Forces blocked 2,000 credible asylum claims from Afghan commandos, MoD confirms", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9l9elr95zo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "500 days of the Israel-Hamas war, by the numbers.", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-500-days-numbers-c244fe24769dbfabcbcdfb10487ce106", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
