I made **ProcrastiScan**, yet another one you might ditch or finally embrace. It's particularly designed to be neurodiversity-friendly, especially in regards to ADHD, autism and demand avoidance.\n\n**Why?**\n\nThere are lots of blocking/mindfulness extensions out there, but I often found them either too rigid (blocking whole sites I sometimes need) or too simplistic (simple keyword matching/indifferent to my behavioral patterns). **What makes ProcrastiScan different? It tries to understand what you're actually looking at.** Some potential use cases for this approach:\n\n* you need to browse some distracting website for a task, but also procrastinate there\n* you find yourself overwhelmed with dozens of tabs open and want to sort out all the distracting ones with one click\n* you are stuck in a hole of executive dysfunction or inertia and need a push to get out of it\n* you tried nudging tools but got annoyed about staring at a green screen for 10 seconds when you just need to take a quick look somewhere\n* you tried other blocking tools but found yourself sabotaging them out of frustration about rules being incompatible with reality\n* you don't realize when you start to become distracted\n\n**How?**\n\nInstead of just blocking \"youtube.com\" entirely, ProcrastiScan tries to figure out the meaning of the page you're on. You give it a simple description of your task (like \"Research why birds can fly\") and list some topics/keywords that are usually relevant (like \"birds, physics, air, aerodynamics\") and ones that usually distract you (like \"funny videos, news, entertainment, music, youtube\").\n\nAs you browse, it quietly calculates a \"Relevance Score\" for each tab based on these inputs and a \"Focus Score\" that tracks your level of concentration. If you start drifting too much and the score drops, it gives you a nudge.\n\n**Features**\n\nSome people prefer gentle nudges and other to block distracting content straight away, so you can choose whatever you prefer:\n\n* Tab Blocking: Automatically detect distracting tabs and block them\n* Procrastination List: Recognize and save distracting tabs for later\n* Chatbot: Engage in a focused conversation with an AI assistant to get back on track or reflect on why you got distracted (highly experimental)\n* Theme Nudging (Firefox only): Your browser toolbar will be colored in a bright red tone if you get distracted to increase your mindfulness\n* Dashboard: See at which times you were focused or distracted\n\nAdditionally, **ProcrastiScan is completely free and no data is collected.** All processing and storing happens on your device.\n\nThe extension can only see what happens in your browser, but you can optionally download a program to score other programs on your computer as well. [**Here is the GitHub repository**]( with links to the browser extension stores, more infos on how it works and limitations, a setup guide, as well as a FAQ.
