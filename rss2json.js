Thanks so much for the support on our GRPO release 2 weeks ago! Today, we're excited to announce that you can now train your own reasoning model with just 5GB VRAM for Qwen2.5 (1.5B) - down from 7GB in the previous [Unsloth]( release!\n\n1. This is thanks to our newly derived Efficient GRPO algorithm which enables ***10x longer context*** lengths while using ***90% less VRAM*** vs. all other GRPO LoRA/QLoRA implementations, even those utilizing Flash Attention 2 (FA2).\n2. With a GRPO setup using TRL + FA2, Llama 3.1 (8B) training at 20K context length demands 510.8GB of VRAM. However, Unsloth\u2019s 90% VRAM reduction brings the requirement down to just 54.3GB in the same setup.\n3. We leverage our [gradient checkpointing]( algorithm which we released a while ago. It smartly offloads intermediate activations to system RAM asynchronously whilst being only 1% slower. ***This shaves a whopping 372GB VRAM*** since we need num\\_generations = 8. We can reduce this memory usage even further through intermediate gradient accumulation.\n4. Try our free GRPO notebook with 10x longer context: Llama 3.1 (8B) on Colab\n\nBlog for more details on the algorithm, the Maths behind GRPO, issues we found and more: [\n\n  \nGRPO VRAM Breakdown:\n\n|Metric|\ud83e\udda5 Unsloth|TRL + FA2|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Training Memory Cost (GB)|42GB|414GB|\n|GRPO Memory Cost (GB)|9.8GB|78.3GB|\n|Inference Cost (GB)|0GB|16GB|\n|Inference KV Cache for 20K context (GB)|2.5GB|2.5GB|\n|Total Memory Usage|**54.3GB (90% less)**|**510.8GB**|\n\n* We also now provide full logging details for all reward functions now! Previously we only showed the total aggregated reward function itself.\n* You can now run and do inference with our [4-bit dynamic quants]( directly in vLLM.\n* Also we spent a lot of time on our Guide for everything on GRPO + reward functions/verifiers so would highly recommend you guys to read it: [docs.unsloth.ai/basics/reasoning](\n\nThank you guys once again for all the support it truly means so much to us!
