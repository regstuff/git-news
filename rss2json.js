For example, if I have a table of city names and I receive the strings \"Jefferson City, MO\" or \"Jeff City\" or \"Jefferson City, Miss\" I want them all to match to \"Jefferson City, Missouri.\"\n\nI first tried solving this with fuzzy matching from the fuzzywuzzy library using Levenshtein\u00a0distance and that worked pretty well as a first quick attempt.\n\nNow that I have some more time I'm returning to the problem to use some more sophisticated techniques. I've been able to improve upon the fuzzy matching by using the SentenceTransformer library from HuggingFace to generate an embedding of the token. I also generate embeddings of all the tokens in the reference table. Then I use the faiss library to find the existing embedding that is closest to the new embedding. If you're interested I can share some python code in a comment.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Have you had success with a different approach or a similar approach but with some tweaks? For example, I just discovered the \"Splink\" library when doing some searching which seems promising but my input is mostly strings rather than tabular data.\n2. Do you think it's worth it to try to fine tune the sentence embeddings to fit my specific use case? If so, have you found any high quality tutorials covering how to get that working?\n3. Do you think it's worth it to introduce an element of attention to the embeddings? Continuing the example from above I might have \"Jefferson City\", \"St. Louis\", and \"Kansas City\" all in the same document and then if I get \"Springfield\" next it would be great to interpret that as \"Springfield, MO\" rather than a \"Springfield\" in another state. My understanding is that introducing attention can get me closer to that sort of logic -- has anyone had luck introducing that in a problem like this or have a high quality tutorial to link to?\n\nI appreciate your input thank you very much!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1chuo1d/what_do_you_think_is_the_state_of_the_art/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Radiocarbon chronology of Iron Age Jerusalem reveals calibration offsets and architectural developments", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2321024121", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Joshua Dean, whistle\u00adblow\u00ader who accused Boeing supplier of ignoring defects, dies", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/2/whistleblower-joshua-dean-ex-worker-at-boeing-supplier-dies", "author": "None"}, {"title": "We think we control our health \u2013 but corporations selling forever chemicals, fossil fuels and ultra-processed foods have a much greater role", "summary": "", "link": "https://theconversation.com/we-think-we-control-our-health-but-corporations-selling-forever-chemicals-fossil-fuels-and-ultra-processed-foods-have-a-much-greater-role-227776", "author": "None"}, {"title": "United Methodist Church lifts bans on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex weddings", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2024/05/01/1248468256/united-methodist-church-lifts-bans-on-lgbtq-clergy-and-same-sex-weddings", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u201cHand axe\u201d usage in the Americas?
