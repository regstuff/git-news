Some theories say they used ramps or a sloping and encircling embankment of brick, earth, and sand but... I just don't think they had the power to pull that many incredibly heavy stones up vertically. My theory is simple but it would take time and dedication.\n\nShifting sands.\n\nI think they pulled countless sleds back and forth to the pyramids to maintain a low degree slope all the way to the top. I don't think it's exactly a ramp because it would need to be about a mile to make it a lot easier to get 80 ton granite stones all the way to the top. And by a lot easier I mean feasible at all. 3,300 pounds is how much the average stone weighed and that's tough to move by todays standards let alone 2.3 million times for the biggest of the three. The heaviest stones among them at the top above the \"King's Chamber,\" weighed 20 to 80 tons each. At.. the top... that's 176,370 pounds @ 80 tons. You don't just throw that on your back.\n\nAfter they were done they could reverse the process and show the world a true marvel. Think of a snowplow truck on the road; after some distance how much weight has been shifted forward and to the side a few feet? It's a similar concept with sleds and time.\n\nI wondered if this was correct and I did find this picture.\u00a0[\n\nThe employed repetition and dedication. 2.3 million stones x3 aren't easily hauled straight up a massive pyramid with limited technology.\n\nThey may have had to remove larger stones and haul them away in the opposite direction to clear the way but that is more easily managed and possible. I believe a lot of sand is in the area supporting this idea.\n\nThey definitely used the Nile River to transport stones as close as they could on rafts. They continually had to drag stones from further away because of the incline requirements as the pyramids were built upwards.\n\nI think they could play SENET while they sat on a sled. Maybe they played with a neighbor or a walker? One walks, one sits and then you reverse the process in the other direction, playing a game a few months a year inbetween jobs.\n\ncheers.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ifxauy/great_pyramids_construction_theory/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
