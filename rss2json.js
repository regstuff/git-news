She called Sunday\u2019s early election only after three months in office, hoping to turn that around while her popularity is high.\n\n&gt;The ultraconservative Takaichi, who took office as Japan\u2019s first female leader in October, pledged to\u00a0\u201cwork, work, work,\u201d\u00a0and her style, which is seen as\u00a0both playful and tough, has resonated with younger fans who say they weren\u2019t previously interested in politics.\n\n&gt;The opposition, despite the formation of a new centrist alliance and a rising far-right, was too splintered to be a real challenger. The new opposition alliance of LDP\u2019s former coalition partner, Buddhist-backed dovish Komeito, and the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is projected to sink to half of their combined preelection share of 167 seats.\n\n&gt;The prime minister wants to push forward a significant shift to the right in Japan\u2019s security, immigration and other policies. The LDP\u2019s right-wing partner, JIP leader Hirofumi Yoshimura, has said his party will serve as an \u201caccelerator\u201d for this push.\n\n&gt;Japan has recently seen far-right populists gain ground, such as the\u00a0anti-globalist and surging nationalist party Sanseito. Exit polls projected a big gain for Sanseito.\n\n&gt;", "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/02/08/japanese-prime-minister-sanae-takaichi-landslide-win-ldp-supermajority-right-wing-agenda-fiscal-boost-military-spending/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thousands protest over Israeli President Herzog\u2019s visit to Australia", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pro-palestine-protest-planned-sydney-against-israeli-president-herzogs-visit-2026-02-08/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hong Kong\u2019s Jimmy Lai sentenced to 20 years in prison after landmark national security trial | CNN", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/china/jimmy-lai-sentenced-20-years-intl-hnk", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Japan's Iron Lady Takaichi forges stunning election win", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-votes-test-pm-takaichi-snow-weighs-turnout-2026-02-07/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mayor of London: My ultimate goal is to reverse Brexit", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2026/02/08/sadiq-khan-my-ultimate-goal-is-to-reverse-brexit/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Malaysia Witnesses First AI Data Centre Protest In Johor", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.lowyat.net/2026/381039/malaysia-witnesses-first-ai-data-centre-protest-in-johor/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Poland\u2019s population decline accelerated in 2025, with 168,000 more deaths than births", "summary": "", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/02/01/polands-population-decline-accelerated-in-2025-with-168000-more-deaths-than-births/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Malnutrition reaches famine levels in two more areas of Sudan's North Darfur, monitor says", "summary": "Acute malnutrition has reached famine levels in two more areas of North Darfur, Sudan, a global hunger monitor said on Thursday, amid a civil war that has displaced millions and triggered waves of ethnically charged violence.\n\nThe U.N.-backed [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification]( (IPC) found that famine thresholds for acute malnutrition have been surpassed in Um Baru - where the rate of acutely malnourished children aged under five was nearly double the famine threshold, and Kernoi.\n\nThe IPC alert is not a formal famine classification, but it highlights alarming levels of hunger based on the latest data.\n\nThe two localities near the border with Chad received some of the tens of thousands who fled the district of [al-Fashir]( \\- previously determined to be in [famine]( \\- late last year when it fell to the Rapid Support Forces.
