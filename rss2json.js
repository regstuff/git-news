I truly believe this could be a game-changer for both professionals and enthusiastic hobbyists, especially if we manage to get it off the ground with the limited resources I currently have.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: the type of work this tool would handle requires specialized knowledge that's hard to find. For businesses, finding qualified people is a real challenge, and when they do, the process tends to be really time-consuming. I think if we could make this tool work, it would be easy to market to companies in this niche around the world.\n\nFor hobbyists and enthusiasts, this tool could be a huge help too. It would allow them to perform highly technical tasks with just some basic understanding. I\u2019m imagining it like this: watch a couple of general YouTube videos, and you\u2019re good to go.\n\n# About the SaaS Tool (MVP)\n\nThe idea for the MVP is relatively simple. Imagine an LLM (large language model) that reads a PDF file of electronic schematics and provides a step-by-step guide, asking the user to input measurements and making decisions based on those inputs. It's like having a guided troubleshooting process for diagnostics.\n\nIf this MVP works, I\u2019d like to look for funding to develop a full-fledged version, integrating communication with physical bench-top measuring tools, AI vision, and tapping into a wealth of knowledge from forums and resources already out there on the internet.\n\n# The Problem\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: I\u2019m not a developer, and I don\u2019t know where to start with building this MVP. But I\u2019m very open to learning, collaborating, and gathering all the help I can to create something that could attract investors and take this concept to the next level.\n\nIf anyone is interested in working together on this or has advice, my DMs are open. Whether you\u2019re a developer, someone with experience in SaaS MVPs, or just curious about the concept, I\u2019d love to connect.\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can make something exciting happen!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1gkfsaq/seeking_help_to_build_a_saas_mvp_for_a_niche/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nafas v0.8: Pranayama Breathing Techniques for Geeks", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/nafas", "author": "None"}, {"title": "daily-wiki-pic: The bot that fetches the picture of the day from Belarusian Wikipedia and posts it to Mastodon.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/hleb-kastseika/daily-wiki-pic", "author": "None"}, {"title": "China is building new villages on its remote Himalayan border.
