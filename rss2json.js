He described the law promulgating the expulsion and resettlement of southeastern Native American tribes as the \u201chappy consummation\u201d of U.S. Indian policy. To his critics who \u201cwept over the fate of the aborigines\u201d\u2014and who, it turned out, accurately predicted the horrors of the forced migrations known collectively to history as the Trail of Tears\u2014Jackson offered an archeology lesson. Any \u201cmelancholy reflections\u201d were ahistorical, he said, because the Indians were neither innocent victims nor first peoples, but perpetrators of what Jackson\u2019s modern admirers might call \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d\n\nJackson knew this because the evidence was everywhere in plain sight.\n\n\u201cIn the monuments and fortifications of an unknown people, we behold the memorials of a once-powerful race,\u201d said Jackson, \u201cexterminated to make room for the existing savage tribes.\u201d\n\nThis reference to a \u201conce-powerful race\u201d was not lost on the American public of 1830. Every schoolboy and girl knew it to be the Lost Race of the Mound Builders, believed to be the continent\u2019s original Caucasian inhabitants. From the colonial era into the twentieth century, it was widely accepted that certain earthen structures and burial grounds proved the existence of \u201cwhite\u201d or Indo-European peoples who settled North America only to be wiped out by the arrival of Jackson\u2019s \u201csavage (Asiatic) tribes.\u201d\n\n\n\u2026.", "link": "https://observatory.wiki/How_Pseudo-Archaeology_and_Phony_Alt-History_Rose_to_Popularity_in_the_US", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Prominent German leftist politician sprayed with a red liquid, likely paint, during campaign event", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/germany-sahra-wagenknecht-paint-election-afd-erfurt-bf159280064d0dc0946c6122919edfb8", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A girl who got a Kindergartener pass from a president, graduates at 16 and gets accepted into 60 Colleges", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.americanpress.com/2024/05/07/local-teen-graduating-two-years-early-has-1m-in-scholarship-offers/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "An Obesity Drug Prevents Covid Deaths, Study Suggests", "summary": "a", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/wegovy-covid-deaths.html?unlocked_article_code=1.G04.mNZr.vCAat2ELLoN4&amp;smid=re-share", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Introducing smd: A Simple Markdown Viewer for Your Terminal", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/guilhermeprokisch/smd", "author": "None"}, {"title": "President Putin makes first visit to I.C.C. member state since arrest warrant", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/world/europe/putin-visit-mongolia-icc.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Singapore jails man who planted cannabis in estranged wife's car", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9l8zx2wn4o", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
