The network is intended to protect Poland\u2019s eastern borders, where, in September last year, around 20 Russian drones\u00a0[entered Polish airspace](\u00a0in an unprecedented incursion.\n\n\u201cWe are creating an unprecedented, state-of-the-art system,\u201d declared Prime Minister Donald Tusk at today\u2019s signing ceremony. \u201cThere is no other example in Europe today of this kind of integrated, intelligent anti-drone system.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the impetus behind its development had been the \u201cnightmare\u201d incursion of Russian drones. While some of these were shot down with expensive air-to-air missiles, others were not stopped before hitting Polish territory.\n\nThe new anti-drone system, known as SAN, will provide a \u201cmore effective, cost-efficient and intelligent\u201d way of defending from such threats, said Tusk.\n\nSAN will be supplied by a consortium of Polish state defence holding company Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa, private Polish firm Advanced Protection Systems, and Norway\u2019s Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace. It will consist of an array of interconnected systems to detect and destroy unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about 18 anti-drone batteries, 52 fire teams, 18 command teams and 703 vehicles,\u201d said defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz.\u00a0\u201cAll of this means we\u2019ll be extremely effective in countering threats coming from the east.\u201d\n\nSAN is intended to add a fourth layer to Poland\u2019s air defences, alongside three existing programmes:\u00a0[WIS\u0141A]( which offers medium-range defence; NAREW, which operates at short range; and the very-short-range PILICA+.\n\nWhile Poland has embarked on an\u00a0[unprecedented defence spending spree](\u00a0in recent years,\u00a0[some analysts have warned](\u00a0that its focus on traditional hardware was potentially leaving the country unprepared for modern forms of warfare that rely on the mass use of cheap drones.\n\nThe cost of the latest deal has not been specified, but Kosiniak-Kamysz announced that it was \u201cseveral billion zloty\u201d.\u00a0*Gazeta Wyborcza*, a leading newspaper, reports the figure as 15 billion zloty (\u20ac3.6 billion) and says that delivery is scheduled for 2027.\n\nThe money will partly come from the European Union\u2019s SAFE instrument, which provides EU-backed loans to help member states boost defence spending.\n\nPoland has been earmarked as the\u00a0[largest single recipient of SAFE funds]( with almost \u20ac44 billion of the \u20ac150 billion total. Earlier this week, the European Commission approved Poland\u2019s request for the funds, and the decision is due to receive final approval from the EU Council in February.\n\n\u201cPoland bears the responsibility, expenses and organisation of protecting the Polish, European and NATO borders, but we cannot and will not be left alone,\u201d said Tusk today.\n\n\u201cThe SAN programme is an example of this. The resources that will be used to build this programme include European funds, unprecedented in their scale and ease of acquisition.\u201d\n\nTusk also hailed the fact that Poland would be working with a Norwegian partner on the project, following yesterday\u2019s announcement that\u00a0[Norway will be buying rocket artillery missiles produced in Poland](\n\n\u201cWe not only appreciate the extraordinary competence of our Norwegian partners, but this is also part of the new security architecture that Poland initiated nearly two years ago,\u201d said the Polish prime minister, whose government has sought\u00a0[closer defence and energy ties with Baltic and Nordic countries](\n\nHowever, today\u2019s announcement was criticised by Mariusz B\u0142aszczak, who served as defence minister in Poland\u2019s former Law and Justice (PiS) government and is now the head of the parliamentary caucus of PiS, which is the largest opposition party.\n\n\u201cAlthough the agreement is presented as a success for the Polish defence industry, its main beneficiaries are foreign entities offering solutions that compete with those produced in Poland,\u201d wrote B\u0142aszczak on social media.\n\n\u201cThe current leadership of the \\[defence\\] ministry first completely ignored the threat posed by Russian drones violating Polish airspace. It took what was almost a tragedy for them to start doing anything at all. However, the hastily prepared programme was based on foreign solutions.\u201d\n\nHowever, deputy defence minister Cezary Tomczyk subsequently announced that 60% of the costs of SAN \u2013 which he confirmed at 15 billion zloty \u2013 would be spent within the Polish defence industry.", "link": "https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/30/poland-signs-contract-for-anti-drone-system-in-wake-of-russian-incursions/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Gas leak caused blast in Iran's Bandar Abbas, Iranian media say", "summary": "Separately, four people were killed after another gas explosion in the city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border, according to state-run Tehran Times.", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-occurs-irans-southern-port-bandar-abbas-iranian-media-reports-2026-01-31/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Russians identify Poland and Lithuania as their greatest enemies", "summary": "Russians regard Poland and Lithuania as their greatest enemies among a list of 12 countries (not including Ukraine) presented to them in a survey by the Levada Center, an independent polling organisation.\n\nAsked how they assess the countries, 62% of respondents said that Poland and Lithuania are \u201cenemies\u201d. That was more than for the United Kingdom (57%), Germany (50%), Sweden (40%), United States (27%), Israel (25%), Turkey (3%), Iran (2%), North Korea (2%), China (1%) and India (1%).\n\nMeanwhile, only 2% of Russians see Poland as a \u201cfriend\u201d, the same proportion as for the UK and Sweden. The figure was even lower, at 1%, for Lithuania, Germany, and the US. Russians were much more likely to see China (29%), North Korea (28%), India (24%) and Iran (18%) as friends.\n\nWhile that survey question did not include Ukraine, another part of the study, which asked respondents to name five countries that are the most unfriendly or hostile towards Russia, did.\n\nThe question has been asked by the Levada Center since 2005, and its results show that, since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russians have generally been more likely to see Poland, Germany and the US as unfriendly or hostile than Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the proportion regarding the US as unfriendly or hostile dropped sharply in 2025, with the Levada Center noting that last year saw a \u201cTrump effect\u201d in which attitudes towards the US warmed among Russians.\n\nAnother survey question, asking specifically how Russians view their country\u2019s relations with Poland, found that, up to 2010, a majority of between 50% and 80% consistently rated them as \u201cgood\u201d and only 20% to 40% as \u201cbad\u201d.\n\nThat question was not asked between 2011 and 2024, but now the figures have been completely reversed. In 2024, 74% of Russians perceived relations with Poland negatively, and only 16% positively.\n\nMeanwhile, asked in 2025 which countries \u201cpose a real threat to Russia\u2019s stability and global influence\u201d, Poland was the third most common answer, chosen by 36%, behind only the United States (73%) and United Kingdom (42%) but ahead of Germany (30%).\n\nThe findings were part of a new\u00a0[report]( titled\u00a0*Russia and the World: Enemies, Competitors, Partners*, conducted by the Levada Center on behalf of the German Sakharov Society and presented in Berlin on Tuesday.\n\nThe Levada Center has been monitoring public sentiment in Russia for almost 40 years. Since 2016, it has been included on the Kremlin\u2019s list of \u201cforeign agents\u201d after it published polling ahead of that year\u2019s elections indicating declining support for Putin\u2019s United Russia party.\n\nThe German Sakharov Society notes that the report\u2019s findings show how the Kremlin uses \u201canti-Western demagoguery and militarisation in all areas of life\u2026\\[to\\] keep Russian society on a war course and ensure its own continued power\u201d.\n\nThe findings also come amid a period of increased tension between Poland and Russia.
