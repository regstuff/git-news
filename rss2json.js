It tracks token usage, estimates costs, monitors performance metrics, and provides actionable insights through a configurable status display. The system supports a wide range of LLMs through multi-source model detection and offers extensive customization options via Valves and UserValves.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Comprehensive Model Support**: Multi-source model detection using OpenRouter API, exports, hardcoded defaults, and user-defined custom models in Valves\n- **Advanced Token Counting**: Primary tiktoken-based counting with intelligent fallbacks, content-specific adjustments, and calibration factors.\n- **Cost Estimation &amp; Budgeting**: Precise cost calculation with input/output breakdown and multi-level budget tracking (daily, monthly, session).\n- **Performance Analytics**: Real-time token rate calculation, adaptive window sizing, and comprehensive session statistics.\n- **Intelligent Context Management**: Context window monitoring with progress visualization, warnings, and smart trimming suggestions.\n- **Persistent Cost Tracking**: File-based tracking (cross-chat) with thread-safe operations for user, daily, and monthly costs.\n- **Highly Configurable UI**: Customizable status line with modular components and visual indicators.\n\n## Other Features\n\n- **Image Token Estimation**: Heuristic-based calculation using defaults, resolution analysis, and model-specific overrides.\n- **Calibration Integration**: Status display based on external calibration results for accuracy verification.\n- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies, API failures, and unrecognized models.\n- **Content-Type Detection**: Specialized handling for different content types (code, JSON, tables, etc.).\n- **Cache Optimization**: Token counting cache with adaptive pruning for performance enhancement.\n- **Cost Optimization Hints**: Actionable suggestions for reducing costs based on usage patterns.\n- **Extensive Logging**: Configurable logging with rotation for diagnostics and troubleshooting.\n\n## Valve Configuration Guide\n\nThe function offers extensive customization through Valves (global settings) and UserValves (per-user overrides):\n\n### Core Valves\n- **[Model Detection]**: Configure model recognition with fuzzy_match_threshold, vendor_family_map, and heuristic_rules.\n- **[Token Counting]**: Adjust accuracy with model_correction_factors and content_correction_factors.\n- **[Cost/Budget]**: Set budget_amount, monthly_budget_amount, and budget_tracking_mode for financial controls.\n- **[UI/UX]**: Customize display with toggles like show_progress_bar, show_cost, and progress_bar_style.\n- **[Performance]**: Fine-tune with adaptive_rate_averaging and related window settings.\n- **[Cache]**: Optimize with enable_token_cache and token_cache_size.\n- **[Warnings]**: Configure alerts with percentage thresholds for context and budget usage.\n\n### UserValves\n\nUsers can override global settings with personal preferences:\n* Custom budget amounts and warning thresholds\n* Model aliases for simplified model references\n* Personal correction factors for token counting accuracy\n* Visual style preferences for the status display\n\n## UI Status Line Breakdown\n\nThe status line provides a comprehensive overview of the current session's metrics in a compact format:\n\n\n\ud83e\ude99 48/1.0M tokens (0.00%) [\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1] | \ud83d\udd3d5/\ud83d\udd3c43 | \ud83d\udcb0 $0.000000 | \ud83c\udfe6 Daily: $0.009221/$100.00 (0.0%) | \u23f1\ufe0f 5.1s (8.4 t/s) | \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f $99.99 left (0.01%) this month | Text: 48 | \ud83d\udd27 Not Calibrated\n\n\n### Status Components\n- **\ud83e\ude99 48/1.0M tokens (0.00%)**: Total tokens used / context window size with percentage\n- **[\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1]**: Visual progress bar showing context window usage\n- **\ud83d\udd3d5/\ud83d\udd3c43**: Input/Output token breakdown (5 input, 43 output)\n- **\ud83d\udcb0 $0.000000**: Total estimated cost for the current session\n- **\ud83c\udfe6 Daily: $0.009221/$100.00 (0.0%)**: Daily budget usage (spent/total and percentage)\n- **\u23f1\ufe0f 5.1s (8.4 t/s)**: Elapsed time and tokens per second rate\n- **\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f $99.99 left (0.01%) this month**: Monthly budget status (remaining amount and percentage used)\n- **Text: 48**: Text token count (excludes image tokens if present)\n- **\ud83d\udd27 Not Calibrated**: Calibration status of token counting accuracy\n\n### Display Modes\nThe status line adapts to different levels of detail based on configuration:\n\n1. **Minimal**: Shows only essential information (tokens, context percentage)\n   \n   \ud83e\ude99 48/1.0M tokens (0.00%)\n   \n\n2. **Standard**: Includes core metrics (default mode)\n   \n   \ud83e\ude99 48/1.0M tokens (0.00%) [\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1] | \ud83d\udd3d5/\ud83d\udd3c43 | \ud83d\udcb0 $0.000000 | \u23f1\ufe0f 5.1s (8.4 t/s)\n   \n\n3. **Detailed**: Displays all available metrics including budgets, token breakdowns, and calibration status\n   \n   \ud83e\ude99 48/1.0M tokens (0.00%) [\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1] | \ud83d\udd3d5/\ud83d\udd3c43 | \ud83d\udcb0 $0.000000 | \ud83c\udfe6 Daily: $0.009221/$100.00 (0.0%) | \u23f1\ufe0f 5.1s (8.4 t/s) | \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f $99.99 left (0.01%) this month | Text: 48 | \ud83d\udd27 Not Calibrated\n   \n\nThe display automatically adjusts based on available space and configured preferences in the Valves settings.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n1.
