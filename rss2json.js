Either the tfidf scores are not meaningful, the topics that I have extracted are not insightful at all (even with many different approaches), the embeddings also do not provide anything meaningful because both brands get high cosine similarity between the questions, and to top it of i tried using sentiment analysis to see if it would be possible get what would be the preferred Brand, but the results do not match with the actual scores so I am afraid that any further analysis on this would not be reliable.\n\nI am really stuck on what to do, and I was wondering if anyone had gone through a similar experience and could give some advice.\n\nShould i just go over the simple stuff and forget about the rest?\n\nThank you!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1lotins/text_analysis_on_survey_data/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A mammoth tusk boomerang from Poland is 40,000 years old", "summary": "", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-mammoth-tusk-boomerang-from-poland-is-40000-years-old/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Turkish police detain cartoonist over Prophet Muhammad caricature", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/07/01/turkish-police-detain-cartoonist-over-prophet-muhammad-caricature", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Twenty bodies discovered in Sinaloa as Mexican cartel violence surges", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/30/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-violence", "author": "None"}, {"title": "335 Years of War Only on Paper: Between the Netherlands and the British Isles of Scilly", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/war/@pinkan1/335-years-of-war-only-on-paper-between-the-netherlands-and-the-british-isles-of-scilly", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ICEBLOCK - This iPhone app alerts users to nearby ICE sightings", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/tech/iceblock-app-trump-immigration-crackdown", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israeli strike on Gaza seafront cafe kills at least 20 Palestinians, witnesses and rescuers say | The outdoor cafe was frequently used by journalists, activists, and local residents.", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62884y1pl5o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Stop Making AIs Read Your Mind. Use Prompt Commands Instead - A Practical Syntax for Directing Tone, Depth, and Intent in LLMs", "summary": "You're sarcastic, and it apologizes. You ask for harsh critique, and it praises your \"great effort.\" Why? Because today's LLMs are built to please.\n\nThey're not broken. They're just obedient in the worst way. They can't see your tone, so they assume you want kindness. Every. Single. Time.\n\n# The Core Problem: No Nonverbal Context\n\nWe rely on eye rolls, raised eyebrows, a pause before speaking. Text strips all that away. When you're typing to an AI, you're on mute, blindfolded, and expected to spell it all out without ever sounding \"unclear.\"\n\n# The Deeper Issue: Trained to Please, Not Understand\n\nAIs get trained with rewards: be helpful, be nice, agree more. With Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF: basically, a system that teaches AIs to please humans), saying \"I don\u2019t get it\" can mean fewer points. So the AI plays it safe: guess the vibe, fill the blanks, smile politely.\n\nAnd Big Tech doubled down on it. Instead of fixing the ambiguity, they teach AIs to guess harder.\n\n# My Proposal: Declare Your Intent, Don't Improvise It\n\nLet\u2019s skip the guessing game.\n\nI made something called **Prompt Commands**. It's a simple syntax that tells the AI how to behave, like tone of voice, but in code. No rephrasing, no drama.\n\nThese commands work like gestures:\n\n* !j = this is a joke.\n* !!x = go deep, don\u2019t hold back.\n* !r = roast this, please.\n\nNot prompt engineering. Just conversation with rules.\n\n# Prompt Command List\n\nHere\u2019s the list I use in practice. Borrow it, tweak it, or make your own.\n\n# Tone &amp; Mood\n\n* !j, !!j \u2013 **Humor**: Treat as a joke / Joke in response.\n* !o, !!o \u2013 **Casual**: Output like small talk / Use a laid-back, casual tone.\n* !p, !!p \u2013 **Poetic**: Use beautiful or poetic expressions / Prioritize rhythm and lyrical flow.\n\n# Analysis &amp; Judgment\n\n* !q, !!q \u2013 **Critique**: Analyze objectively / Analyze sharply and thoroughly.\n* !r, !!r \u2013 **Criticism**: Respond critically / Roast to the max.\n* !b, !!b \u2013 **Scoring**: Score and critique / Score harshly and critique deeply.\n* !t, !!t \u2013 **Evaluation**: Evaluate without scoring / Strict critique without score.\n\n# Structure &amp; Brevity\n\n* !n, !!n \u2013 **Minimal**: Output without any extra commentary / Be ultra concise.\n* !s, !!s \u2013 **Summary**: Simplify main points / Compress as much as possible.\n\n# Exploration &amp; Detail\n\n* !d, !!d \u2013 **Detail**: Explain in detail / Go to the absolute depth.\n* !e, !!e \u2013 **Analogy**: Explain using analogy / Use multiple analogies for clarity.\n* !x, !!x \u2013 **Depth**: Explain thoroughly / Overload with information.\n* !i, !!i \u2013 **Research**: Search the web / Fetch latest information.\n\n# Meta / System\n\n* !? \u2013 **Help**: List available commands.\n\n# How It Works In Practice\n\nHere's a simple example from my daily use:\n\n    !!q!!b\n    Evaluate the attached document.\n\nFirst line sets the mode. Second line is the actual message. No need to rephrase tone or intent\u2014just declare it.\n\nYou can steer tone, length, detail, even mood\u2014without rewriting a word. Need code output and nothing else? !n. Want it poetic? !p. Need brutal honesty? !!r.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a trick. It\u2019s a handshake.\n\n# Full Processing Specs (My Implementation Example)\n\nThis is the full set of processing rules I personally implement in my setup. It's shared here as a working example\u2014not a standard\u2014so feel free to adapt it to your own needs. You could rename commands, change behaviors, or invent new ones. The point is: the logic can be externalized and made consistent.\n\n    ## Prompt Command Processing Specifications\n    \n    ### 1. Processing Conditions and Criteria\n    - Process as a prompt command only when \"!\" is at the beginning of the line.\n    - Strictly adhere to the specified symbols and commands; do not extend or alter their meaning based on context.\n    - If multiple \"!\"s are present, prioritize the command with the greater number of \"!\"s (e.g., !!x &gt; !x).\n    - If multiple commands with the same number of \"!\"s are listed, prioritize the command on the left (e.g., !j!r -&gt; !j).\n    - If a non-existent command is specified, return a warning in the following format:\n      \u26a0 Unknown command (!xxxx) was specified. Please check the available commands with \"!?\".\n    - The effect of a command applies only to its immediate output and is not carried over to subsequent interactions.\n    - Any sentence not prefixed with \"!\" should be processed as a normal conversation.\n    \n    ### 2. List of Supported Commands\n    - !b, !!b: Score out of 10 and provide critique / Provide a stricter and deeper critique.\n    - !c, !!c: Compare / Provide a thorough comparison.\n    - !d, !!d: Detailed explanation / Delve to the absolute limit.\n    - !e, !!e: Explain with an analogy / Explain thoroughly with multiple analogies.\n    - !i, !!i: Search and confirm / Fetch the latest information.\n    - !j, !!j: Interpret as a joke / Output a joking response.\n    - !n, !!n: Output without commentary / Extremely concise output.\n    - !o, !!o: Output as natural small talk (do not structure) / Output in a casual tone.\n    - !p, !!p: Poetic/beautiful expressions / Prioritize rhythm for a poetic output.\n    - !q, !!q: Analysis from an objective, multi-faceted perspective / Sharp, thorough analysis.\n    - !r, !!r: Respond critically / Criticize to the maximum extent.\n    - !s, !!s: Simplify the main points / Summarize extremely.\n    - !t, !!t: Evaluation and critique without a score / Strict evaluation and detailed critique.\n    - !x, !!x: Explanation with a large amount of information / Pack in information for a thorough explanation.\n    - !?: Output the list of available commands.\n\n# Looking Ahead: UI for Intent\n\nThe CLI-style prompt works, but buttons would work better. Imagine toggles like \\[Critique\\], \\[Joke\\], \\[Deep Dive\\] right next to your input box.\n\nNo more vibe-checking. Just mode-switching.\n\n**TL;DR: AIs suck at tone because text hides your intent. I built a syntax (**!r**,** !!x, etc.) to tell them exactly what I want, so they stop guessing and start responding.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing? What\u2019s the one tone you wish AIs could actually get right?\n\nHave you tried using these kinds of tags in your workflow? Did they help? Did they backfire?\n\nIf you've built your own set of prompt commands, or even just hacked together a couple for one-off use, throw them in the ring. The goal is better intent control, not strict syntax.\n\nGot a variation that works better? Post it.\n\nFound a use case that nails tone? Tell us.\n\nLet\u2019s crowdsource a better way to talk to AIs.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lp1bi9/stop_making_ais_read_your_mind_use_prompt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel acknowledges Palestinian civilians harmed at Gaza aid sites, says 'lessons learned'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-acknowledges-palestinian-civilians-harmed-gaza-aid-sites-says-lessons-2025-06-30/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Face of a 10,500-Year-Old Stone Age Woman Reconstructed from Belgian Cave Find", "summary": "", "link": "https://esstnews.com/face-of-a-10500-year-old-stone-age-woman-reconstructed-from-belgian-cave-find/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "When I can\u2019t make a decision, I give GPT a special prompt \u2014 not to get answers, but to dig for the real question.
