Exploring Cultural Bias in AI Reasoning [Thesis discussion/feedback welcome]", "summary": "Hey all \u2014 I\u2019m currently doing a Master\u2019s in Computer Science (background in psychology), and I\u2019m working on a thesis project that looks at how large language models might reflect culturally specific ways of thinking, especially when it comes to moral or logical reasoning.\n\nHere\u2019s the core idea:\n\n&gt; Most LLMs (like GPT-3 or Mistral) are trained on Western, English-language data. So when we ask them questions involving ethics, logic, or social reasoning, do they reflect a Western worldview by default? And how do they respond to culturally grounded prompts from non-Western perspectives?\n\n\n\nMy plan is to:\n\nUse moral and cognitive reasoning tasks from cross-cultural psychology (e.g., individualism vs. collectivism dilemmas)\n\nPrompt different models (local and API-based)\n\nAnalyze the responses to see if there are cultural biases in how the AI \"thinks\"\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I\u2019d love to hear from you:\n\nDo you think this is a meaningful direction to explore?\n\nAre there better ways to test for cultural reasoning differences?\n\nAny existing datasets, papers, or models that might help?\n\nIs analyzing LLM outputs on its own valid, or should I bring in human evaluation?\n\nHave you personally noticed cultural slants when using LLMs like ChatGPT?\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts \ud83d\ude4f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1kxyaah/do_language_models_think_like_the_west_exploring/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Israel announces major expansion of settlements in occupied West Bank", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j5954edlno", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Earthquake reveals a Roman theatre in a Croatian town", "summary": "", "link": "https://bonenbronze.blogspot.com/2025/05/earthquake-reveals-roman-theatre-in.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "We just hit 10M monthly downloads on Hugging Face!", "summary": "And it's all thanks to you guys - the amazing community, brilliant model labs, and incredible HF team! \ud83d\udc96\n\nThank you once again to each and every one of you guys who have supported us throughout the years and we can't wait for more!\n\nLet us know what models we should upload and new formats like AWQ, int4 etc. I'd love to know your thoughts! :)", "link": "https://i.redd.it/7wkbxa116j3f1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Elon Musk is leaving the Trump administration", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-donald-trump-big-beautiful-bill-aa2bc70b0ebdb219b5dd3e9f8fae03af", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A hero named Jes\u00c3\u00bas Garc\u00c3\u00ada: the railroad brakeman who sacrificed his life to save an entire city", "summary": "", "link": "https://peakd.com/history/@davideownzall/a-hero-named-jesus-garcia-the-railroad-brakeman-who-sacrificed-his-life-to-save-an-entire-city", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India\u2019s Geo-economic Warfare Post-Pahalgam", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/india-s-geo-economic-warfare-post-pahalgam", "author": "None"}, {"title": "'No-kids' holiday venue?
