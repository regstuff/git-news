Roosevelt helped shepherd a system into existence which aimed to combat the belief that [might makes right]( massive [economic inequality]( the adoption of [restrictive trade policies]( that set former friends and allies against one another; and [authoritarian regimes]( strengthening their hold on power and [preying on their neighbors]( It was also intended to counter the isolationism of the 1930s and Americans\u2019 all-too-common tendency to see themselves as living in a world apart, protected by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n\nThe creation of the American-led international system we live in today did not simply drop out of the sky. It came about by design\u2014a design animated by Roosevelt\u2019s profound belief in the links between the onset of the Great Depression and the eruption of the most destructive war in human history.\n\nRoosevelt also set out to restore the American people\u2019s faith in democracy at home. He recognized that the misery caused by the Depression had led many Americans\u2014like their counterparts in Europe and Asia\u2014to question the efficacy of democratic government. The raft of programs and laws Roosevelt and Congress enacted during this included Social Security, unemployment insurance, a massive investment in public works, and financial reforms that helped restore the credibility of America\u2019s banking and financial sector.\n\nHe also embraced an effort to reverse the disastrous 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff, understing that tariffs were a tax on poor and working Americans and regarded the use of the progressive income tax as a much more equitable\u2014and economically advantageous\u2014means of raising revenue. He also comprehended the terrible impact the 1930 tariff, the second highest in U.S. history, had on the domestic and global economy. It increased costs at home and strangled international trade as other nations\u2014including Great Britain, Canada, and much of Europe\u2014retaliated. \n\nIn 1934, this effort culminated in the [Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act]( (RTAA), which gave the executive branch the power to negotiate trade agreements. the vast majority of those negotiated were used to lower existing tariffs. It was this process that gave birth to the multilateral rules-based freer trading system that expanded over the second half of the 20th century.\n\nWhen Adolf Hitler plunged the world into war in September 1939, it unleashed a fierce debate in the U.S. about avoiding any involvement in the war. By 1940, those who opposed U.S. involvement had coalesced into the powerful [America First movement]( Roosevelt nevertheless managed to send aid to allies.\n\nAfter the war, to prevent a return of isolationism, Roosevelt led the negotiations that produced the Bretton Woods Accords, which created the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and the establishment of the United Nations.\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s crucial insight was that the costs of such trade wars aren\u2019t just economic\u2014they can also be political and dangerous. A trade war stands to not only weaken the Western alliance at the very moment when [China]( is on the rise and [Europe]( is facing its first major conflict since the end of World War II, it also comes at a time when\u2014thanks to vast economic inequality\u2014the efficacy of democratic government is being challenged by the [similar]( of populist anti-democratic forces that emerged in the 1930s.", "link": "https://time.com/7276697/the-perils-of-jettisoning-the-world-franklin-roosevelt-created/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {}};
