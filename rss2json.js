It has been at the heart of\u00a0[Poland\u2019s rule-of-law dispute](\u00a0after the former Law and Justice (PiS) government in 2017 changed the manner in which the KRS\u2019s members are appointed.\n\nPreviously, most were chosen by judges themselves. However, after PiS\u2019s reforms, most were selected by politicians. The move was widely condemned by expert bodies as undermining judicial independence. Polish\u00a0and\u00a0European court rulings have found the KRS to no longer be a legitimate body.\n\nThe government that replaced PiS in 2023 has\u00a0[proposed legislation](\u00a0to transfer the power to elect most KRS members back to the judiciary. The bill was approved by parliament in January but has yet to be signed by President Karol Nawrocki, a PiS ally.\n\nGiven that the four-year terms of current KRS members will expire on 12 May, Wednesday this week was the final day permitted by law for parliament to launch the procedure for choosing their replacements, which must start at least 90 days in advance.\n\nJustice minister Waldemar \u017burek and W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, had expressed hope that Nawrocki would sign the law before that deadline.\n\nHowever, as he had not done so by Wednesday, Czarzasty said that he had no choice but to launch the process of choosing new KRS members because, although the current rules are flawed, they remain binding.\n\n\u201cI asked the president to\u2026sign the bill on the KRS, which he has in his possession. He did not sign it. Therefore, the president takes full responsibility for the fact that I had to initiate the procedure according to the old, bad law,\u201d said Czarzasty, quoted by the Onet news website.\n\nHe noted that the law currently in force \u201ctakes away judges\u2019 independence\u201d and \u201chas led to the legal system being very unstable\u201d. Because thousands of judicial appointments have been made by the reformed KRS since 2017, there are legal doubts about the status of those judges and the legitimacy of their rulings.\n\nIn\u00a0[one recent case]( a court annulled a divorce because it had been granted by a judge appointed through the disputed process.\u00a0\n\nEarlier this week, however, Czarzasty said that, if the president ends up signing the bill, any steps taken under the current rules to elect new members would have no legal effect. Nawrocki has until 19 February to make a decision.\n\n\u017burek announced earlier this week that the government has a \u201cplan B\u201d if the president vetoes the bill, which he said officials at the presidencial palace had indicated was likely.\n\nThe plan would involve parliament, where the government has a majority, simply approving KRS members democratically chosen by judges themselves. That would in effect restore the situation that existed before PiS\u2019s 2017 reform, though without actually changing the law.\n\n\u201cLet the democratic majority respect the choice of the judicial community, so that this process is in line with the constitution and serves citizens as well as the stability of judicial rulings,\u201d said \u017burek on social media.\n\nIn 2019, Poland\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0[ruled](\u00a0that, due to PiS\u2019s reforms, \u201cthe KRS is not an impartial and independent body\u201d as it had been rendered \u201cdependent on the executive authorities\u201d. In 2022, the same\u00a0[court](\u00a0found the KRS to no longer be consistent with its role outlined in the constitution.\n\nIn 2021, the European Court of Human Rights likewise\u00a0[found](\u00a0the overhauled KRS was no longer independent from legislative or executive powers.
