Obviously, inference on non-GPU hardware is **slooooooow**, but that's fine\u2014I use it to quietly generate data, unsupervised in the background, for things that aren't time-sensitive. But small LLMs are finicky, so having the ability to iterate and test the effects of small tweaks is much easier when you can compare them side-by-side.\n\nagon is the tool I built to manage this. It lets you fire off the same prompt to 1-4 models on different hosts in parallel (in multimodelMode) to directly compare:\n\n* ***Response times (and see which model is most efficient)***\n* ***Response accuracy and overall quality***\n* ***How well they handle tool usage (via the built-in*** mcpMode***)***\n* ***If they can actually produce valid JSON (using*** jsonMode***)***\n* ***The effect of tweaking parameters (which you can set per model, per host)***\n\nEvery request is aggregated and logged, no matter which mode you use.
