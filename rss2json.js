As ChatGPT streams its reply, each sentence is queued and processed by the text-to-speech engine in real time.\n\n**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f 4\ufe0f Wake Up, mIA! (Wake Word Detection**)\n\nHere\u2019s where things got tricky. Continuous listening with speech\\_to\\_text isn\u2019t possible because it auto-stops after a few seconds. My first solution was a\u00a0**push-to-talk button**\u2026 but let\u2019s be honest, that defeats the purpose of a voice assistant. \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo, I explored\u00a0**wake word detection**\u00a0(like\u00a0*\u201cHey Google\u201d*) and started with\u00a0**Porcupine**\u00a0from Picovoice.\n\n* **Problem:**\u00a0The free plan only supports 3 devices. I have an iPhone, an Android, my wife\u2019s iPhone, and a wall-mounted tablet. On top of that, Porcupine counts both dev and prod versions as separate devices.\n* **Result:**\u00a0Long story short\u2026\u00a0**my account got banned.**\u00a0\ud83d\ude05\n\n**Solution:**\u00a0I switched to\u00a0**DaVoice (\u00a0:\n\n* [\n* [\n\nHuge shoutout to the DaVoice team \ud83d\ude4f\u2014they were incredibly helpful in guiding me through the integration of\u00a0**custom wake word**s. The package is super easy to use, and here\u2019s the best part:  \n\u2728\u00a0**I haven\u2019t had a single false positive since using it - even better than what I experienced with Porcupine!**  \nThe wake word detection is\u00a0**amazingly accurate**!\n\nNow, I can trigger mIA just by calling its name.  \nAnd honestly\u2026 it feels magical. \u2728\n\n**\ud83d\udc40 5\ufe0f Making mIA Recognize Me: Facial Recognitio**n\n\nControlling my smart home with my voice is cool, but what if mIA could\u00a0**recognize who\u2019s talking**?  \nI integrated\u00a0**facial recognition**\u00a0using:\n\n* **FaceDetector**\u00a0from\u00a0**Google ML Kit**\u00a0(\n* **TensorFlow Lite**\u00a0(\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about this, I highly recommend this course:\n\n* \ud83c\udf93\u00a0[\n\nNow mIA knows if it\u2019s talking to me or my wife\u2014personalization at its finest.\n\n**\u26a1 6\ufe0f Making mIA Take Action: Smart Home Integration**\n\nIt\u2019s great having an assistant that can chat, but what about\u00a0**triggering real actions**\u00a0in my home?\n\nHere\u2019s the magic: When\u00a0**ChatGPT**\u00a0receives a request that involves an external tool (defined in the assistant prompt), it decides whether to trigger an action. That simple\u2026  \nHere\u2019s the flow:\n\n1. **The app receives an action request**\u00a0from ChatGPT\u2019s response.\n2. **The app performs the action**\u00a0(like turning on the lights or skipping to next track).\n3. **The app sends back the result**\u00a0(success or failure).\n4. **ChatGPT picks up the conversation**\u00a0right where it left off.\n\nIt feels like\u00a0**sorcery**, but it\u2019s all just API calls behind the scenes. \ud83d\ude04\n\n**\u2764\ufe0f 7\ufe0f Giving mIA Some \u201cPersonality\u201d: Sentiment Analysis**\n\nWhy stop at basic functionality? I wanted mIA to feel more\u2026\u00a0**human**.\n\nSo, I added\u00a0**sentiment analysis**\u00a0using\u00a0**Azure Cognitive Services**\u00a0to detect the emotional tone of my voice.\n\n* If I sound happy, mIA responds more cheerfully.\n* If I sound frustrated, it adjusts its tone.\n\nBonus: I added\u00a0**fun animations**\u00a0using the\u00a0**confetti**\u00a0package to display cute effects when I\u2019m happy. \ud83c\udf89\u00a0(*\n\n**\u2699\ufe0f 8\ufe0f Orchestrating It All: Workflow Management**\n\nWith all these features in place, I needed a way to manage the flow:\n\n* **Waiting \u2192 Wake up \u2192 Listen \u2192 Process \u2192 Act \u2192 Respond**\n\nI built a custom\u00a0**state controller**\u00a0to handle the entire workflow and update the interface to see the assistant listening, thinking or answering.\n\nTo sum up:\n\n**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Talking to mIA Feels Like This**:\n\n\"Hey mIA, can you turn the living room lights red at 40% brightness?\"  \n\"mIA, what\u2019s the recipe for chocolate cake?\"  \n\"Play my favorite tracks on the TV!\"\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly satisfying to interact with mIA like a real companion. I\u2019m constantly teaching mIA new tricks. Over time, the voice interface has become so powerful that the app itself feels almost secondary\u2014I can control my entire smart home, have meaningful conversations, and even just chat about random things.\n\n**\u2753 What Do You Think?**\n\n* Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific part of this setup?\n* Curious about how I integrated facial recognition, API calls, or workflow management?\n* Any suggestions to improve mIA even further?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude80", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1ipwksz/meet_mia_my_custom_voice_assistant_for_smart_home/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Man Burning Quran Outside Turkish Consulate In London Attacked By Knife", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.news18.com/world/man-burning-quran-outside-turkish-consulate-in-london-attacked-by-knife-9227729.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trump's F-35 promise to Modi rattles Pakistan, foreign office cries wolf in response", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/trumps-f-35-promise-to-modi-rattles-pakistan-foreign-office-cries-wolf-in-response-13863503.html/amp", "author": "None"}, {"title": "UK army 'so run down' it could not lead Ukraine peace force, says former chief", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czep44jn9jyo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "[Terraform CI/CD automation] - Terrateam: Open-source GitOps tooling for infrastructure", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukraine secures return of 8 children from Russian-occupied territories", "summary": "", "link": "https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-8-children-from-russian-occupied-territories/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Clox v0.5 Release: A Geeky Clock for Terminal Enthusiasts", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/clox", "author": "None"}, {"title": "India-Bangladesh border talks next week; fencing, attacks by Bangladeshi miscreants on agenda", "summary": "", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-bangladesh-border-talks-fencing-attacks-agenda-9836467/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Senior UN peacekeeper injured in convoy attack in Lebanon", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdl6d0r2g5o", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Approval rating of Brazil's Lula falls to 24% from 35%, pollster Datafolha says", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-approval-rating-falls-24-35-pollster-datafolha-says-2025-02-14/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Should I choose Archeology or Geography as a major?", "summary": "I've been stressing myself out for hours over this issue.
