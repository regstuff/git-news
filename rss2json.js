The country has been at the center of geopolitical tension with India ever since the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia, an event that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau openly blamed on Indian involvement\u2014without presenting concrete evidence. What followed was a diplomatic storm, souring India-Canada relations.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s consistent sympathy towards Khalistani extremists under the guise of freedom of expression, despite growing evidence of their involvement in hate speech, violence, and attacks on Indian diplomats as only made the relationship worse. His failure to take serious action against anti-India elements operating freely on Canadian soil has long been a point of contention for Indians worldwide.\n\nOn the otherside, the silence of the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who often dodged the issue of Khalistani violence and never explicitly condemned the attacks on temples or threats to Indian diplomats is also questionable. It's understandable that the conservatives need votes from urban amalgations like Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton, which hold a decent chunk of Punjabi voter, and by taking a stand for or against the Khalistan movement, Poilievre would be isolating the other half of the voters.\n\nThis election, however, brought major upsets and changes, especially among Punjabi-origin candidates:\n\n**Key Defeats**\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP and an open supporter of the Khalistan movement, suffered a humiliating loss\u2014coming third in his constituency. His party\u2019s disastrous performance will likely cost it its national party status, effectively ending his political career.\n\nKamal Khera, a former federal minister in the new Carney-led Liberal cabinet, also lost her seat\u2014ironically to another Punjabi candidate, Amarjeet Gill. Khera was a vocal critic of India post-Nijjar and pushed for stronger actions against India.\n\nAmarjeet Sohi, the mayor of Edmonton, lost the federal race but will continue in his mayoral role. Alongside Harjit Sajjan, who chose not to contest this time, Sohi had earlier distanced himself from the Khalistan issue, stating that he was \u201cneither for nor against\u201d the movement\u2014a position clarified after Captain Amarinder Singh refused to meet them during Trudeau\u2019s infamous visit to Punjab.\n\nGeorge Chahal and Kamal Khera, both considered soft Khalistan sympathizers, were also shown the door by voters. It would interesting to see if Khera, the former Health Minister is replaced by another Punjabi or not.\n\n**Biggest Losses for India**\n\nChandra Arya, a rare voice of reason in Canadian politics who staunchly opposed the Khalistan movement and openly called for curbing future extremist threats, had his candidacy cancelled by the Liberal Party. His seat of Nepean was handed over to none other than the new PM, Mark Carney. Arya, a Karnataka-origin MP, was the only one to consistently speak up for India\u2019s interests in Parliament. His exit is a major blow.\n\nTim Uppal, deputy Conservative leader and a vocal Khalistan sympathizer, managed to win his seat. With Poilievre losing in Carleton, a leadership vacuum is likely in the Conservative Party. If Uppal runs and wins, India-Canada ties could hit a new low\u2014this would be the first time one of the two big party leader is openly sympathetic to the Khalistan cause.\n\n**New Punjabi MPs**\n\nDespite the losses, a record 22 Punjabi-origin MPs were elected this time, with many of them being first time MPs. It remains to be seen how they position themselves on the Khalistan issue, which continues to divide the diaspora. With the exit of prominent names like Jagmeet Singh and Kamal Khera, there\u2019s space for a new narrative\u2014perhaps one more aligned with peace and diplomacy.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1kcp3zv/canadas_2025_elections_indias_stakes/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\ude80 I built a Chrome extension \u2014 **PromptPath** \u2014 for versioning your AI prompts _in-place_ (free tool)", "summary": "**\ud83e\udde0 Why I built it**\n\nWhen I'm prompting, I'm often deep in flow \u2014 exploring, nudging, tweaking. \n\nBut if I want to try a variation, or compare what worked better, or understand why something improved \u2014 I\u2019m either juggling tabs, cutting and pasting in a GDoc, or losing context completely.\n\n[PromptPath]( keeps the process in-place. You can think of it like a lightweight Git timeline for your prompts, with commit messages and all.\n\nIt's especially useful if:\n\n* You're iterating toward production-ready prompts\n* You're debugging LLM behaviors\n* You're building with agents, tool-use, or chains\n* Or you're just tired of losing the \u201cgood version\u201d somewhere in your browser history\n\n**\u2728 What PromptPath does**\n\n* \\- Tracks prompt versions as you work (no need to copy/paste into a doc)\n* \\- Lets you branch, tag, and comment \u2014 just like Git for prompts\n* \\- Shows diffs between versions (to make changes easier to reason about) \n* \\- Lets you go back in time, restore an old version, and keep iterating\n* \\- Works \\_directly on top\\_ of sites like ChatGPT, Claude and more \u2014 no new app to learn\n\n**\ud83e\uddea Example Use**\n\nWhen working in ChatGPT or Claude, just select the prompt you're refining and press \u2303/Ctrl + Shift + Enter \u2014 PromptPath saves a snapshot right there, in place.\n\nYou can tag it, add a comment, or create a branch to explore a variation.  \n\nLater, revisit your full timeline, compare diffs, or restore a version \u2014 all without leaving the page or losing your flow.\n\nEverything stays 100% on your device \u2014 no data ever leaves your machine.\n\n\ud83d\udee0 How to get it\n\n* Install from the Chrome Web Store: [\ud83d\udd17 PromptPath](\n* Go to your favorite LLM playground (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and refresh your LLM tab \u2014 it hooks in automatically\n* Press \u2303/Ctrl + Shift + P to toggle
