Thanks so much for the support on our GRPO release 2 weeks ago! Today, we're excited to announce that you can now train your own reasoning model with just 5GB VRAM for Qwen2.5 (1.5B) - down from 7GB in the previous [Unsloth]( release!\n\n1. This is thanks to our newly derived Efficient GRPO algorithm which enables ***10x longer context*** lengths while using ***90% less VRAM*** vs. all other GRPO LoRA/QLoRA implementations, even those utilizing Flash Attention 2 (FA2).\n2. With a GRPO setup using TRL + FA2, Llama 3.1 (8B) training at 20K context length demands 510.8GB of VRAM. However, Unsloth\u2019s 90% VRAM reduction brings the requirement down to just 54.3GB in the same setup.\n3. We leverage our [gradient checkpointing]( algorithm which we released a while ago. It smartly offloads intermediate activations to system RAM asynchronously whilst being only 1% slower. ***This shaves a whopping 372GB VRAM*** since we need num\\_generations = 8. We can reduce this memory usage even further through intermediate gradient accumulation.\n4. Try our free GRPO notebook with 10x longer context: Llama 3.1 (8B) on Colab\n\nBlog for more details on the algorithm, the Maths behind GRPO, issues we found and more: [\n\n  \nGRPO VRAM Breakdown:\n\n|Metric|\ud83e\udda5 Unsloth|TRL + FA2|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Training Memory Cost (GB)|42GB|414GB|\n|GRPO Memory Cost (GB)|9.8GB|78.3GB|\n|Inference Cost (GB)|0GB|16GB|\n|Inference KV Cache for 20K context (GB)|2.5GB|2.5GB|\n|Total Memory Usage|**54.3GB (90% less)**|**510.8GB**|\n\n* We also now provide full logging details for all reward functions now! Previously we only showed the total aggregated reward function itself.\n* You can now run and do inference with our [4-bit dynamic quants]( directly in vLLM.\n* Also we spent a lot of time on our Guide for everything on GRPO + reward functions/verifiers so would highly recommend you guys to read it: [docs.unsloth.ai/basics/reasoning](\n\nThank you guys once again for all the support it truly means so much to us! We also have a major release coming within the next few weeks which I know you guys have been waiting for - and we're also excited for it. \ud83e\udda5", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1iu4kd6/10x_longer_context_90_less_vram_grpo_now_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Talk of boycotting American archaeologists from Dr. Jonathan Driver", "summary": "An academic boycott would be particularly damaging to the field of science and intellectual progress as a whole. Scientific research and scholarship thrive on collaboration, open dialogue, and the exchange of ideas across borders. Cutting ties with American academics will not punish policymakers\u2014it will only hinder scientific progress and weaken our ability to address global challenges.\n\nFurthermore, combating misinformation and fostering critical thinking require engagement, not isolation. At a time when misinformation and division are rampant, academic institutions should be working together to uphold rigorous scholarship and truth. Severing relationships with American researchers will not change political realities, but it will harm the very foundation of international academic integrity and cooperation.\n\nIf we truly want to promote positive change, we must remain engaged, uphold our academic principles, and work collectively to strengthen, rather than dismantle, the international scholarly community.\n\nIf you feel the same, I implore that you email Dr. Driver to stand with American archaeologists.
