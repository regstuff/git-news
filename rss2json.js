Need help, please!", "summary": "I've deployed OWUI for a production usecase in AWS and currently have around \\~1000 users. Based on some data analysis I've done there are never 1000 concurrent users, I think we've had up to 400 concurrent users, but can have 1000 unique users in a day.  I'll walk you through the issues I'm observing, and then through the setup I have. Perhaps someone has been through this and can help out? or maybe you notice something that could be the problem? Any help is appreciated!\n\n**Current Issue(s):**\n\nI'm getting complaints from users a few times a week that the chat responses are slow, and that sometimes the UI itself is a bit slow to load up. Mostly the UI responds quickly to button clicks but getting a response back from a model takes a long time, and then the tokens are printed at an exceptionally slow rate. I've clocked slowness at around 1 token per 2 seconds.\n\nI suspect that this issue has something to do with Uvicorn workers and / or web socket management. I've setup everything (to the best of my knowledge) for production grade usage. The diagram and explanation below explains the current setup. **Has someone had this issue? If so, how did you solve it? what do you think I can tweak from below to fix this issue?**\n\n**Here's a diagram of my current setup.** \n\n[Architecture Diagram](\n\n**I've deployed Open WebUI, Open WebUI pipelines, Jupyter Lab, and LiteLLM Proxy as ECS Services. Here's a quick rundown the current setup:** \n\n1. Open WebUI - Autoscales from 1 to 5 tasks, each task containing 8 vCPU, 16GB Ram, and 4 FastAPI (uvicorn) workers. I've deployed it using gunicorn, wrapping uvicorn workers in it. The UI can be accessed from any browser as it is exposed via an ALB. It autscales on requests per target as normally CPU and Memory usage is not high enough to trigger autoscaling. It connects to an ElasticCache Redis OSS \"cluster\" which is not running in cluster mode, and an Aurora PostgreSQL Database which is running in cluster mode. \n2. Open WebUI pipelines - Runs on a 2 vCPU and 4GB ram Task, does not autoscale. It handles some light custom logic and reads from a DB on startup to get some user information, then keeps everything in memory as it is not a lot of data. This runs on a 2 vCPU\n3. LiteLLM Proxy - Runs on a 2 vCPU and 4GB ram Task, it is used to forward requests to Azure OpenAI  and receive repsonses to relay them back to OWUI. It also forwards telemetry information to a 3rd party tool, which I've left out here. It also uses Redis as its backend DB to store certain information.\n4. Jupyter Lab - runs on a 2 vCPU and 4GB ram Task, it does not autoscale. It serves as Open WebUI's code interpreter backend so that code is executed in a different environment.\n\nAs a side note, Open WebUI and Jupypter Lab share an EFS Volume so that any file / image output from Jupyter can be shown in OWUI. Finally, my Redis and Postgres instances are deployed as follow.\n\n* ElastiCache Redis OSS 7.1 - one primary node and one replica node. Each a cache.t4g.medium instance\n* Aurora PostgreSQL Cluster - one writer and one reader. Writer is a db.r7g.large instance and the reader is a db.t4g.large instance.\n\nEverything looks good when I look at the AWS metrics of different resources. CPU and Memory usage of ECS and Databases are good (some spikes to 50% but not for long, around 30% avergage usage), connection counts (to databases) is normal, Network throughput looks okay, Load Balancer targets are always healthy etc, writing to disk or writing to DBs / reading from them is also okay. Literally nothing looks out of the ordinary. \n\nI've checked Azure OpenAI, Open WebUI Pipelines, and LiteLLMProxy. They are not the bottle necks as I can see LiteLLMProxy getting the request and forwarding to Azure OpenAI almost instantly, and the response comes back almost instantly.

Only Finland saw a faster increase, with debt rising 7.8 points to 88.4% of GDP, according to Eurostat.\n\nThe EU statistical agency reported that the average public debt-to-GDP ratio across the EU stood at 81.9% at the end of the second quarter, while the eurozone average was higher at 88.2%.\n\nGreece remained the bloc\u2019s most indebted country, with public debt at 151.2% of GDP, followed by Italy at 138.3% and France at 115.8%.
