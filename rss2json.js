Inference in the blink of an eye! Congratulations!\n\nWhat I want to achieve: \n\n1. User enters a prompt that contains a special token  \n2. System reads that token, and loads (attaches?) the corresponding LoRAs   \n3. System does the inference and then unloads the un-used adapters, leaving the base model\n\nIs this even possible? how does a production server achieves this? \n\n  \nI'm loading a base model as in documentation:\n\n    base_model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 model_name = \"unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit\",\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 max_seq_length = max_seq_length,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 dtype = dtype,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit\n    )\n\nI train it, and now I have the weights of the adapter in a separate folder called \\lora\\_model\\,\n\nIf I want to load it I do:\n\n    from unsloth import FastLanguageModel\n    \n    max_seq_length = 2048 \n    dtype = None \n    load_in_4bit = True \u00a0 \u00a0 \n    \n    base_model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 model_name = \"lora_model\",\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 max_seq_length = max_seq_length,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 dtype = dtype,\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit,\n    )\n    FastLanguageModel.for_inference(base_model) \n\nNow if I want to unload or change to another one, I don't know where to go from there.   \n  \nOf course I'm using Unsloth, I can load the \"lora\\_model\" the peft library with no problem and then I have access to all the methods such as \"disable\\_adapter\\_layers\", \"enable\\_adapter\\_layers\", etc ... still it is kind of slow and switching between different \"Lora's\" is not that practical if even doable in production. \n\nI guess I'm asking instruction / advice? \n\nThanks!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unsloth/comments/1fpkwv3/switch_between_adapters_without_having_to_reload/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Meta's new Llama 3.2 brings tiny models to mobile devices and adds image understanding", "summary": "1/ Meta has released Llama 3.2, a series of open source AI models for edge devices and vision applications. The 1B and 3B text models are designed to run on smartphones, where they can summarize or paraphrase texts, for example.\r\n\r\n2/ Meta is also releasing 11B and 90B vision models that can keep up with similarly sized, closed models for image understanding tasks. A new architecture with additional adapter weights enables the input of images.\r\n\r\n3/ To simplify development with Llama models, Meta is introducing the first official Llama stack distributions, an API for turnkey applications with retrieval augmented generation and tool connectivity. It remains to be seen whether the models will prevail over system-integrated mobile solutions.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/1fprgkm/metas_new_llama_32_brings_tiny_models_to_mobile/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Have you used ChatGPT for NLP analysis?

The interview will take around 25-30 minutes, and as a thank-you, I\u2019m offering a $10 Amazon or Starbucks gift card.\n\nIf you have experience in this area and would be open to chatting, please comment below or DM me.
